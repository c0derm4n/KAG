Among the OSs, an amorphous In–Ga–Zn–O (IGZO)6) has attracted particular attention for TFT applications owing to its field effect mobility (µFE) of over 10 cm2/Vs, steep subthreshold swing (S.S.), extremely low off current, and large-area uniformity. Although µFE of an IGZO TFT is more than ten times as high as that of an amorphous Si (a-Si:H) TFT, an improvement in the µFE of OS TFTs has been required to widen their range of applications as alternative to low-temperature processed poly-Si (LTPS) TFTs. Furthermore, in recently, hybrid TFTs technology, named as low-temperature processed poly-Si and OS (LTPO) TFTs, is used for mobile displays in order to satisfy the requirements of high-mobility LTPS TFTs for peripheral drivers and the OS TFTs with extremely low-off current for pixel drivers.7) However, the LTPO process is complicated and required additional mask steps. Therefore, the development of high-mobility OS TFTs is of great importance to achieve simple and cost-effective TFT array for future displays.\n\nA single-crystalline In2O3 has a mobility as high as 160 cm2/Vs,8) which makes polycrystalline InOx a potential material for enhancing µFE of OS TFTs.9) Koida et al. reported the transparent conductive oxide (TCO) of poly-InOx can be formed by solid-phase crystallization (SPC) at 200 °C.10) Hall mobility of as high as 130 cm2/Vs was reported from the SPC-InOx; however, background electron concentration is over 1020 cm-3. It is known that undoped InOx thin films exhibit higher background electron density, which is attributed to the presence of native defects such as oxygen vacancies. To apply the poly-InOx based OSs for highmobility TFTs with moderate values of threshold voltage (Vth) \nand ON/OFF current ratio, a small amount of dopant having a high bond dissociation energy with oxygen is used as a carrier suppressor. Ebata et al. reported Ga-doped poly-InOx (poly-IGO) \nTFT with µFE of 39.1 cm2/Vs.\n\n11) Carrier density of poly-IGO film could be reduced to ~1017 cm-3 by adding Ga content of below 10%. Furthermore, Aman and Magari et al. reported that hydrogen in hydrogenated IGZO acts as a carrier suppressor through annealing by forming metal-hydrogen (M-H) bonds when hydrogen was intentionally added during IGZO \ndeposition.12,13) \nIn this presentation, we propose a hydrogenated polycrystalline IGO (poly-IGO:H) for use in a channel material of the TFTs. An intentionally doped hydrogen in IGO:H film suppressed the crystallization during the film deposition. The as-deposited amorphous IGO:H film could be converted into the poly-IGO:H film by low-temperature SPC below 250 °C. Carrier density of the SPC-IGO:H film could be reduced more than two orders of magnitude as low as that of the poly-IGO film without hydrogen. \n\nMaximum µFE of 50.6 cm2/Vs was obtained from the SPC polyIGO:H TFT. The polycrystalline OSs are simple and costeffective approach to achieve high-performance TFTs for future displays.\n\n## 2. **Deposition Method Of Igo And Igo:H Films**\n\nThe IGO and hydrogenated IGO (IGO:H) films were deposited on glass substrates by RF magnetron sputtering from a sintered IGO target in an Ar+O2+H2 ambient. The O2 and H2 gas flow rate ratios were defined as R(O2)=O2/(Ar+O2+H2) and R(H2)=H2/(Ar+O2+H2), respectively. The R(O2) was set at 4 %, while the R(H2) was varied from 0 to 9 % at a deposition pressure of 0.27 Pa. In this experiment, IGO films deposited without H2 [R(H2)=0] are denoted hereafter as IGO, while IGO films deposited with H2 are denoted hereafter as IGO:H. Then, both the IGO and IGO:H films were annealed in ambient air at 300 °C for 1h for SPC. Crystallinity of as-deposited and annealed films were evaluated by grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GI-XRD) and electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) analyses. Electrical properties of the films were analyzed by Hall measurements. \n\n## 3. **Results And Discussion**\n\n3-1: Crystallinity of as-deposited and annealed IGO and IGO:H films Figure 1 shows the changes in GI-XRD spectra of 50 nmthick IGO and IGO:H films through annealing in ambient air. For the IGO film deposited without H2, weak (222) crystalline peak was observed from as-deposited film. After 200 °C annealing, an IGO film showed clear polycrystalline nature with (222) preferred orientation. On the other hand, the IGO:H film remained amorphous phase even after 200 °C annealing. The IGO:H film exhibited polycrystalline nature when the annealing temperature increased to 250 °C and more. The XRD result indicates that H2 addition during the IGO:H deposition suppressed crystallization during the deposition. Furthermore, SPC was observed at below 250 °C from amorphous IGO:H (a-IGO:H) to polycrystalline IGO:H (SPC-IGO:H). It is noticed that SPC temperature of the IGO:H film is lower than that of poly-Si film (500~600 °C). Thus, the low-temperature SPC of IGO:H is beneficial for TFT application. \n\n![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)\n\nFigure 2 shows the EBSD pattern of the (a) IGO and (b) \nIGO:H films after 250 °C annealing. Although polycrystalline nature was observed from both the films after 250 °C annealing as shown in Fig. 1, EBSD pattern showed a big difference. \n\n![1_image_2.png](1_image_2.png)\n\nGrain size of the poly-IGO film (Fig. 2(a)) is below the electron beam size (0.04 µmφ) of the EBSD measurements. On the other hand, average grain size of the film was enlarged to ~270 nm for the SPC-IGO:H (Fig. 2(b)). This result suggests that the nuclei density in an initial IGO film is high because the IGO film can easily be crystallized during the film deposition. In contrast, introduced hydrogen during the film deposition changes film crystallinity to amorphous and reduces the nuclei density in the as-deposited IGO:H film. Owing to a reduction of the nuclei density in as-deposited IGO:H film, grain size of the SPC-IGO:H \nfilm could be enlarged through SPC. Thus, both the XRD and EBSD results indicated that control of the initial film crystallinity and nuclei density in as-deposited film are key factors to achieve high quality SPC-IGO:H film.\n\n## 3-2: Electrical Properties Of Polycrystalline Igo And Igo:H Films\n\nFigure 3 shows Hall mobilities of the 50 nm-thick poly-IGO \nand SPC-IGO:H films formed by SPC at 300 °C as a function of electron density. Lowest carrier density, which was obtained after 300 °C annealing in ambient air, of the poly-IGO was 3.0×1019 cm-3, while that of the SPC-IGO:H decreased to 1.0×1017 cm-3. \n\n![1_image_1.png](1_image_1.png)\n\nIt is noted that carrier density of the SPC-IGO:H could be reduced more than two orders of magnitude as low as that of the poly-IGO film. Since electrons were generated from native defects in oxide semiconductors such as oxygen vacancy, oxygen vacancy would be reduced by enhancing grain size of the SPC IGO:H film as shown in Fig. 2(b). In addition, we have reported that hydrogen in an amorphous IGZO reduces their carrier density through annealing by forming metal-hydrogen (M-H) bonds. Thus, SPC process enlarged grain size and reduced defect density (e.g. oxygen vacancies) in IGO:H, and hydrogen in SPC-IGO:H would further reduce carrier density by forming M-H bonding in the film. Furthermore, it should be noticed that Hall mobility of the SPC-IGO:H films were much larger than those of poly-IGO \nfilms. Maximum Hall mobility of 52.8 cm2/Vs was obtained from the SPC IGO:H film with a carrier density of 8.0×1019 cm-3. \n\n## 3-3: Fabrication And Characterization Of Spc-Igo:H Tfts\n\nFigure 4 shows a schematic cross-sectional view of fabricated poly-IGO and SPC-IGO:H TFT. \n\nBoth the poly-IGO and SPC-IGO:H TFTs were fabricated on a SiO2/Si substrate. A 100 nm-thick thermally grown SiO2 was used as a gate insulator (GI), and a heavily doped Si wafer was served as a gate electrode. After UV/O3 cleaning of the GI surface, 30 nm-thick IGO and IGO:H films were deposited by RF sputtering without substrate heating. The R(O2) was set at 4 % for both films. An IGO film was deposited without H2, while the IGO:H films were deposited at R(H2) of 3, 5, and 9 %. Both the films were then annealed at 300 °C in ambient air for 1 h. Source and drain (S/D) electrodes were formed by an Al/Mo stacked film. The IGO channels and the S/D electrodes were defined by shadow masks. A 100 nm-thick SiO2 passivation layer (PVL) was deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PE-CVD) at 180 °C \nused tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) and O2 as source gases.14) \nMeasurement pads were opened through PVL by photolithography and dry-etching processes. Finally, TFTs were annealed at 200 °C for 1 h before electrical measurements. \n\nChannel length and width of the TFTs were 1400 and 350 µm, respectively. \n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)\n\nFigure 5 shows transfer characteristics of the TFTs with the SPC-IGO:H channel deposited at R(H2) of 3, 5, and 9 %. PolyIGO TFT (deposited without H2) showed conductive behavior \n(data not shown in Fig. 5) due to a high carrier density (3.0×1019 cm-3) of the IGO film as shown in Fig. 3. \n\n![2_image_1.png](2_image_1.png)\n\nIn contrast, all the TFTs with the SPC-IGO:H channel deposited at R(H2) of 3, 5, and 9 % exhibited good transfer characteristics with a steep sub-threshold swing (S.S.) in the range of 0.07-0.10 V/dec. Threshold voltage (Vth) was defined by required gate voltage (VG) to flow normalized drain current (L/W\n×ID) of 1 nA. Extracted electrical parameters of the TFTs were summarized in Table 1. We found that both on-current and µFE of the TFT increased with increasing R(H2) during the IGO:H channel deposition. \n\nMaximum µFE of 50.6 cm2/Vs with the S.S. value of 0.10 V/dec. \n\nand Vth value of -0.2 V was obtained from the SPC-IGO:H TFT at R(H2) of 9 %.\n\n| R(H2)         | µFE       | S.S.                    | Vth   |      |\n|---------------|-----------|-------------------------|-------|------|\n| %             | (cm2 /Vs) | (V/dec.)                | (V)   |      |\n| Poly-IGO TFT  | 0         | No switching properties |       |      |\n| 3             | 30.5      | 0.07                    | -0.1  |      |\n| SPC-IGO:H TFT | 5         | 38.9                    | 0.11  | -0.9 |\n| 9             | 50.6      | 0.10                    | -0.2  |      |\n\n## 4. **Summary**\n\nIn summary, high-mobility polycrystalline IGO:H TFT was demonstrated by low-temperature solid-phase crystallization. A H2 doping during the IGO:H film deposition suppressed the crystallization during the film deposition. The as-deposited amorphous IGO:H film could be converted into the poly-IGO:H film by low-temperature SPC below 250 °C. Grain size of the SPC-IGO:H enlarged to ~270 nm owing to a reduction of the nuclei density in as-deposited IGO:H film. Carrier density of the SPC-IGO:H film could be reduced more than two orders of magnitude as low as that of the poly-IGO film without hydrogen. The TFTs with the SPC-IGO:H channels deposited at R(H2) of 3, 5, and 9 % exhibited good transfer characteristics. Both oncurrent and µFE of the TFT increased with increasing R(H2) during the IGO:H channel deposition. Maximum µFE of 50.6 cm2/Vs was obtained from the TFT with the SPC-IGO:H channel deposited at R(H2) of 9 %. The polycrystalline OSs are simple and costeffective approach to achieve high-performance OS TFTs for future displays.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nAuthor would like to thank Prof. Wenchang Yeh, Shimane University, Japan for his support and helpful discussion of EBSD results.

The TFTs with dual channel allow* higher mobility than TFTs with a single high mobility channel because the TFTs with dual channel allow strong electron accumulation due to high electron densities both at the interface between gate insulator and 1st oxide semiconductor and at the hetero-junction interface between 1st and 2nd oxide semiconductors. \n\n## Author Keywords\n\nHigh Mobility, Dual Channel, IGZO, IZO, Top Gate (TG), Thin Film Transistor (TFT), Short Channel Length (SCL) \n1. Introduction High-resolution narrow-bezel display panels with integrated gate driving circuits are necessary for high end active matrix organic light emitting diode or liquid crystal display products such as smartphones. Low temperature polysilicon (LTPS) TFTs are mainly used for high resolution mobile displays owing to their high mobilities and low driving voltages, even though the manufacturing process of LTPS TFTs is quite complex, costly, and scale-limited. Hence, there have been growing needs to develop a low cost and high performance TFT technology to replace LTPS TFTs. Amorphous oxide semiconductor (AOS) TFT technology is a good candidate, because the AOS TFTs with commercial indium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO) channel allow mobility value of ~ 10 cm2/Vs with simple fabrication processes [1]. However, the value of mobility is still not enough for high resolution and narrow bezel mobile displays. To achieve higher mobility (μFE) than 10 cm2/Vs, incorporation of the metal cation is reported such as In in ZnO network to form a-IZO semiconductor [2]. The a-IZO TFTs exhibit a large μFE of 30~60 cm2/V.s, however, the increased amount of In cation inside the ZnO network in a-IZO semiconductor accelerates the deterioration of electrical stability owing to the formation of shallow defect states [3] and thus, it is difficult to control threshold voltage (Vth) which is important for the decent operation of gate-driver in panel (GIP) circuits and also, large off-current (IOFF) which results in GIP and pixel circuit malfunctioning. Hence, there is a tradeoff between μFE and positive Vth control in single layer TFTs. Alternatively, TFTs with dual channel oxide semiconductors were proposed to modify the channel conduction, where high carrier density channel acts as a mobility booster and low carrier density channel enhances the electrical properties [4]. However, most of the dual channel engineering were performed on bottom gate \n(BG) TFTs, which can limit high-speed driving in highresolution displays due to larger parasitic capacitance from the overlap area between gate and source/drain (S/D) electrodes in TFTs. Therefore, it is necessary to achieve both high mobility and positive threshold voltage from self-aligned top-gate (TG) TFT structures without overlapping gate and S/D electrodes for high-resolution, high-speed, low-power, and narrow-bezel displays. However, achieving both high mobility and positive Vth position is more challenging from TG TFT structure than BG TFT structure because gate insulator (GI) is deposited on the top of channel layer and it's not easy to reduce carrier density at the interface between GI and channel layer for positive Vth position without scarifying mobility especially from TFTs with single high mobility channel layer. In this study, we introduce coplanar thin-film transistors (TFTs) using dual channel oxide semiconductors by depositing a-IGZO layer on top of the highly conductive a-IZO layer with buffer layer/a-IZO/a-IGZO/GI structure to achieve both high mobility and positive Vth. We also prepared single channel oxide semiconductor TFTs with buffer/a-IZO/GI for comparison. We estimated the energy band diagram of a-IZO/a-IGZO/GI TFT that has a conduction band offset (∆EC) of ~ 0.28 eV to control carrier transport between oxide semiconductor layers by forming dual conduction paths. A significant conduction (EC) band bending of ~ 0.3 eV is found for a-IZO/a-IGZO/GI TFT at aIGZO/GI interface, whereas, 70 meV of EC band bending are estimated for a-IZO/GI TFTs, respectively. Low mobility top aIGZO layer below GI in dual channel coplanar TFT strongly accumulates electron of > 5x1018 cm-3 at both the a-IGZO/GI \nand a-IZO/a-IGZO interfaces. This results in a large μFE of ~ 50 cm2/Vs with positive Vth of > 0 V and low off leakage current \n(IOFF) of < 1 pA by suppressing carriers at a-IGZO/GI interface, because high mobility bottom a-IZO layer largely contributes to high IDS due to large carrier density at a-IGZO/a-IZO interface. Our dual channel coplanar TFT is suitable to overcome the tradeoff between high µFE and positive Vth (enhancement mode operation) with increased IDS. Based on the best of our knowledge, previous reports could not touch the coplanar TFT structure using a high mobility channel (a-IZO)/low mobility channel (a-IGZO)/GI structure. The key results from the present study are the implementation of the dual channel of a-IGZO and a-IZO stack active layer by positioning low mobility channel on the top of high mobility channel with coplanar TFT structure. The precise control of IZO layer thickness was carried out for positive Vth with high µFE of > 50 cm2/Vs. \n\n2. Device Fabrication Top-gate self-aligned coplanar TFTs were fabricated as shown in Fig 1. All the dielectric layers (buffer/gate insulator/interlayer dielectric layers) and channel layers were deposited by AKT PECVD and PVD systems, respectively. Chromium (Cr) was used for both gate and source-drain electrodes. The coplanar TFTs were fabricated on a 400 nm thick SiO2 buffer layer by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) at 350 ⁰C on silicon substrates. We prepared two different types of devices for the comparison; (a) single channel oxide semiconductor layer TFTs with a-IZO/GI structure, and (b) dual channel oxide semiconductor TFTs with a-IZO/a-IGZO/GI structure. The oxide semiconductor layers were deposited at a substrate temperature of 25 ⁰C by the sputtering process and patterned with diluted 1% HCl by wet etch. On top of the oxide semiconductor layers, we deposited a 150nm thick SiO2 GI layer by PECVD at 195 ⁰C and then a 150 nm thick Cr layer was deposited by sputtering and patterned to form the gate electrode. We performed a self-aligned process to etch the GI layer with the gate electrode and then n+ channel regimes are formed by helium (He) plasma treatment. After that, a 400 nm thick SiO2 was deposited as inter-layer dielectric (ILD) by PECVD at 230 ⁰C followed by the VIA hole opening, and a 230 nm thick Cr layer was deposited and patterned to form source/drain (S/D) electrodes. Finally, all the fabricated devices were annealed at 250 ⁰C in air. \n\n## 3. Results And Discussion\n\nFor the fabrication of TG self-aligned coplanar TFTs with aIZO/GI and a-IZO/a-IGZO/GI structures, the TFTs are fabricated together with the same integration processes including the same GI recipe. IGZO channel conductivity was tuned to control electron carrier concentration and oxygen vacancies near the interface between GI and channel layers (a-\nIZO or a-IGZO) by optimizing GI process recipe. Fig. 2 shows transfer characteristics from the coplanar TFTs with (a) single channel a-IZO(16 nm) and (b) dual channel coplanar a-IGZO(10 nm)/a-IZO(16 nm), respectively. Here, channel length (L) and channel width (W) are 10 µm and 40 µm, respectively. The electrical characteristics of the TFTs were measured at room temperature using an Agilent 4156C semiconductor analyzer. \n\nThe field effect mobility, µFE (cm2/Vs), was extracted from transconductance (∂IDS/∂VGS) at VGS = Vth + 10 V, where IDS is the drain-to-source current and VGS is gate-to-source voltage. \n\nThe threshold voltage, Vth (V), is determined from IDS = 10-9 × \n(W/L) (A) at VGS = Vth + 10 V. The subthreshold voltage swing, SS (V/decade), is extracted from the minimum value of \n[∂Log(IDS)/∂(VGS)]-1 at VDS = +1 V. The leakage current, IOFF\n(A), is determined from IDS at VGS = -7 V when VDS = +10 V. Figure 2. (a)-(b) Transfer characteristics of the fabricated \n\n![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)\n\n![1_image_1.png](1_image_1.png) coplanar TFTs with single channel a-IZO semiconductor, and dual channel a-IZO/a-IGZO semiconductor, respectively. \n\n| Channel   | IZO       | IZO/IGZO   | Unit     |\n|-----------|-----------|------------|----------|\n| Thickness | 16        | 16/10      | nm       |\n| Vth       | 0.04      | 2.10       | V        |\n| SS        | 0.20      | 0.14       | V/decade |\n| µFE       | 37.0      | 50.3       | cm2 /Vs  |\n| IOFF      | 3.5x10-11 | 6.5x10-13  | A        |\n\nDecent initial Vth values close to 0 V or positive values for the enhancement operations of the TFTs are achieved by the reduction of carrier densities with the control of channel conductivity from optimized GI recipe. Both TFTs show high µFE, excellent sub-threshold slope (SS) less than 0.2 V/decade with the Vth close to 0V or positive values. Smaller SS indicates good interface between GI and IGZO with smaller trap densities. \n\nOn the other hand, the coplanar TG TFTs with single channel aIZO/GI structure shows higher IOFF due to larger carrier density at a-IZO/GI interface than a-IGZO/GI interface from the TFTs with dual channel a-IZO/a-IGZO/GI structure. The reasons for the low off-state currents from our TFTs with a-IZO/a-IGZO/GI structure are (1) coplanar dual channel TFT structure with high 21680159, 2021, 1, Downloaded from https://sid.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sdtp.14611 by Jinan University, Wiley Online Library on [16/06/2024].

Therefore, under reverse bias condition (VGS < 0 V), we expect that backchannel has very limited contribution to drain current, and hence, the present study achieved low IOFF even with highly conductive back channel. We summarized the electrical parameters of the fabricated single and dual channel coplanar TFTs in Table 1. \n\nFig. 3(a), 3(b), and 3(c) show the energy band diagram of aIZO/a-IGZO/GI TFTs under VGS = 0 V, VGS = 20 V, and VGS < \n0V, respectively, to describe electron transport inside a coplanar dual channel TFTs [5]. Electron affinity (χ) of a-IGZO, and aIZO between the conduction band edge (EC) and the vacuum \n(EVac) are 4.16 eV, and 4.48 eV, respectively. Fig. 3(b) explains the accumulation of electrons in a-IZO/a-IGZO/GI TFT happens at both the top channel a-IGZO near the front interface (aIGZO/GI) and bottom a-IZO channel. Also, the contribution of electron accumulation from the bottom layer (a-IZO) is dominant as EF almost overlaps with EC (~18 meV) that might increase the carrier concentration inside the bottom a-IZO layer \n(~1019 cm-3). Moreover, the presence of ∆EC divides the carrier transport into two conduction paths so that it is expected to transport a large volume of electrons without significant carrier scattering at a-IZO/a-IGZO interface and hence, we achieved higher μFE than a-IZO/GI TFTs. Therefore, it is expected to achieve excellent IDS and μFE due to larger total carrier accumulation. Schematic band diagram at VGS < 0 V where the band offset (∆EC) between a-IGZO and a-IZO layers shows an efficient way to suppress carriers towards the front channel (aIGZO) and thus, the TFTs result in low IOFF as shown in Fig. \n\n3(c). \n\nIn order to investigate the channel length dependency of Vth, \n\n![2_image_1.png](2_image_1.png)\n\nVth values were extracted from transfer characteristics at VDS = +1 V with various TFTs by fixing channel width of 12 µm and varying the channel length from 10 µm down to 3 µm. Transfer characteristics from TFTs with a-IZO/a-IGZO/GI structure are shown in Fig. 4(a). The TFTs do not show notable negative Vth shift and Vth non-uniformity from channel length 10 µm down to 3 µm, which is suitable for low-power, high-speed, and highresolution display applications. \n\nLarger amount of oxygen vacancies at the interface between GI and IGZO or in IGZO affect threshold voltages as channel length become less than 10 µm, which make IGZO channel in TFTs more conductive as a cause of negative Vth shift [6]. The impact of oxygen vacancies become stronger as channel length becomes smaller. Therefore, the ratio (Leff/L) between effective channel length (Leff) and mask channel length (L) becomes smaller by decreasing channel length. Interestingly, our TFTs do not show notable Vth shift with channel length from 10 µm down to 3 µm. To investigate short channel length effect, the difference (∆L) between mask channel length (L) and effective channel length (Leff) was extracted by the transmission line method (TLM) [7]. Total resistance in TFTs was extracted from the measured IDS values by varying VGS from 12 V to 20 V with channel length from 10 µm down to 3 µm as shown in Fig. 5. \n\nExtracted small ∆L value of 0.78 µm indicates that short channel length effect from our TFTs is not critical issues and the oxygen vacancies near n+ source-drain regimes are well controlled during fabrication processes. Negative Vth shift from TFTs can be controlled by decreasing carrier density in the regimes of both channel and n+ source and drain contacts by TFT post annealing in air. However, decreasing carrier density increases both contact resistance and channel resistivity, which reduces mobility by decreasing IDS in TFT. Our TFTs show low contact resistance (2Rc) values of less than 10 kΩ even after final TFT anneal in air, which allows TFTs to maintain high mobility and high IDS without current crowding. During TFT fabrication, we first tuned Vth position by carefully controlling carrier density inside IGZO channel during GI deposition and then reduced IGZO resistivity near source-drain contact regime by helium (He) plasma treatment after GI etch. Further tuning of Vth was performed with TFT post annealing in air. We observed changes of initial Vth position according to various GI deposition conditions.

Note that hydrogen can diffuse into channel layers from both GI and ILD\nlayers during deposition and TFT post annealing, which can cause negative Vth shift with larger Vth non-uniformity.\n\nUnderstanding of how the oxide channel layers are affected by hydrogen and oxygen diffusion will be meaningful for the control of both Vth non-uniformity and position.\n\n![3_image_0.png](3_image_0.png)\n\nwith a-IZO/a-IGZO dual channel layers by varying a-IZO thickness from 10nm to 25nm at fixed a-IGZO thickness of 10nm.\n\n| Channel   | IZO/IGZO   | Unit     |       |          |          |\n|-----------|------------|----------|-------|----------|----------|\n| Thickness | 10/10      | 16/10    | 20/10 | 25/10    | nm       |\n| Vth       | 258        | 2.10     | 0.52  | -3.82    | >        |\n| SSS       | 0.11       | 0.14     | 0.13  | 0.15     | V/decade |\n| 45.6      | 50.3       | 52555555 | 57.2  | cm 2 /Vs |          |\n| PPER      |            |          |       |          |          |\n| I OFF     | 8.6        | 6.5      | 8.6   | 7.6      | 10 13 A  |\n\nOne of the other ways to control Vth position is to optimize the thickness of channel layers as shown in Fig. 5. Vth position is easily controlled by changing bottom layer a-IZO thickness. As expected, higher mobility and more negative Vth shift are observed by increasing a-IZO thickness due to larger carrier densities at both a-IGZO/GI and a-IGZO/a-IZO interface. In Table 2, we summarized the electrical parameters of the dual channel coplanar TFTs by varying a-IZO thickness from 10 nm to 25 nm at fixed a-IGZO thickness of 10 nm.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n4.\n\nWe demonstrated self-aligned coplanar TFTs with a dual channel oxide semiconductor (a-IZO/a-IGZO) structure to obtain high field effect mobility of ~ 50 cm 2 /Vs which is 5 times larger than conventional IGZO TFTs with positive Vth of  > 0 V, good sub-threshold slope of < 0.2 V/decade, and low off leakage current of < 1pA. The fabricated TFTs exhibit enhancement mode operation (Vth > 0 V) with increased I D S .\n\nEvolution of energy band diagram considering material properties such as electronic band-gap, electron affinity, intrinsic carrier concentration of a-IGZO and a-IZO\nsemiconductors from the TFTs with a dual channel a-IZO/a-\nIGZO/GI structure confirms a strong conduction band bending of ~0.3 eV at a-IGZO/GI interface and a conduction band offset of ~ 0.28 eV at a-IZO/a-IGZO interface to allow higher carrier densities for high mobility and high I DS compared to the TFTs with a single channel a-IZO/GI structure. Control of Vth position close to 0 V or positive values is possible by adjusting the thickness of channel layers as well as GI recipe optimization with more rooms for process margin without scarifying mobility value. The TFTs do not show notable short channel effect and channel length dependency even with 3 µ m channel length suitable for low-power, high-speed, and high-resolution displays.\n\n## 5.

High mobility IGTO TFTs have been developed for future applications such as high resolution and narrow bezel OLED displays and micro-LED displays. \n\n## Author Keywords\n\nOxide TFT, BCE, Coplanar, IGTO, AMOLED, MiniLED, Micro-LED\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nThere has been a large demand to increase the panel size with higher resolution, and the current driven displays, hydrogenated amorphous silicon (aSi:H) TFTs, have been replaced by stable high mobility oxide TFTs. Amorphous-In-Ga-Zn-oxide (aIGZO) TFTs (μ = ~10 cm2/V.s) have been adopted for large size AMOLED TVs including 55 inch UHD to 88 inch 8K4K [1-2] since a-IGZO TFT was reported by Dr. Hosono's group [3]. In recent researches, there are reports showing that TFTs with higher mobility than 10 cm2/V.s are required for internal compensation for AMOLED and self-luminous mini-LED and micro-LED displays to realize high definition, narrow bezel, and high quality display [4-5].\n\nIn this paper, high mobility In-Ga-Sn-oxide\n(IGTO) TFTs have been developed, which could greatly assist the efficient formation of percolation by the identical electron configuration of Sn4+and In3+\npathways, leading to enhanced mobility for future applications [6]. The IGTO TFT has higher carrier concentration which causes unstable TFT device characteristics in comparison with conventional aIGZO TFTs. High mobility IGTO TFTs have to be developed by adjusting process conditions of oxide semiconductor and plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) SiO2 layer to improve the reliability issues for self-luminous current-driven display applications. Self-aligned coplanar structure and back channel etched structure have been developed using IGTO active layer. The former structure was developed to secure the stable and reproducible TFT characteristics and the latter structure was tested in terms of simple and low process cost.\n\n## 2. Crystallinity Of Igto Film\n\nCommonly, sputtered IGZO films are formed as amorphous phase without any sign of growth of orientation, which are independent of deposition conditions including DC sputtering power, process pressure, and oxygen concentration. On the other hand, IGTO film phase is changed by process conditions, depending on sputtering power and oxygen concentration. Firstly, the crystallinity of IGTO thin films deposited at different sputtering power and O2 concentration are investigated. \n\nFigure 1 (a) shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) \nspectrums of IGTO films with different sputtering power at constant O2 concentration. It could be seen that the XRD spectrums peak nearly at 31°, which was inferred from (222) plane of In2O3 structures. The higher sputtering power, the larger (222) plane of In2O3 structures. Next, (222) plane of In2O3 structures are increased by increasing O2 concentration at constant sputtering power, which is shown in Figure 1 (b). The higher concentration of reactive oxygen including atomic and excited molecular oxygen improved the oxidation of the metal atoms on the film surface, causing the appearance of indium oxide phase with crystalline phase. At even higher oxygen flow and higher O2 gas ratio, the indium oxide phase rapidly appears and develops into large crystallites [78]. Diffraction peak of SnO2 is never found, which is consistent with the result that Sn can be solved in In2O3 [9]. It has also been reported that crystallized IGTO film is indicative of an increase in oxygen vacancy related defects, which could release excess free electrons during negative bias stress conditions, resulting in more negative threshold voltage shifts [10].\n\n 30 40 50\n\n![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)\n\n 30 40 50 8kW\n\n![1_image_1.png](1_image_1.png)\n\n4kW\n0.35 0.29 0.23\n\n## 3. Self-Aligned Coplanar Igto Tfts\n\nSelf-aligned coplanar structure has merits of lower parasitic capacitance and higher driving stability by no overlap between metals and no back channel damage during source-drain patterning. For the purpose of adopting AMOLED and micro-LED, selfaligned coplanar IGTO TFTs have been developed. \n\nFigure 2 shows the cross-sectional view of selfaligned coplanar IGTO TFTs. First, light shield layers were formed on a glass substrate, which could minimize TFT degradation from the external light. \n\nSiO2 buffer layer and IGTO layer were deposited, and active IGTO was patterned by wet etching process. \n\nGate insulating (GI) SiO2 and gate metal were sequentially deposited, and gate electrode and GI \nlayer were continuously patterned to form self-aligned coplanar structure. Inter-layer dielectric (ILD) were deposited with source-drain (S/D) contact holes. S/D electrodes were deposited and ITO/Ag/ITO pixel electrodes were patterned. Finally, pixel define layer (PDL) was defined and thermal annealing was applied to achieve uniform and stable device performance.\n\nFigure 3 (a) shows the 31 inch 4K2K (144ppi)\ntop emission OLED panel fabricated by IJP technology. The uniformity of transfer characteristics are shown in Figure 3 (b). The self-aligned coplanar IGTO TFTs represent the mobility of around 25 cm2V\n-\n1s\n-1and threshold voltage 0.3V±0.2V, which could drive the top emission IJP OLED panel. \n\n![1_image_2.png](1_image_2.png)\n\nFigure 4 (a) shows the ΔPBTS (Vgs = 30V, 60℃, \nand 3,600 sec) characteristics which are <1.5V, and figure 4 (b) shows the ΔNBTiS (Vgs= -30V, 60℃,\n4,500nit and 3,600 sec) characteristics which are <-\n1.0V. The gate insulating PECVD SiO2 deposition conditions have to be controlled to suppress the increase of carrier concentration in IGTO active layer. Especially GI deposition temperature and N2O/SiH4 ratio play an important role in securing stable TFT \ncharacteristics.\n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)\n\n(a) (b)\n\n \n\n![2_image_2.png](2_image_2.png)\n\n## 4. Back Channel Etched Type Tfts\n\nFigure 5 shows the cross-sectional view of BCE \nIGTO TFTs. At the first step, the Mo/Cu bi-layer gate electrode was deposited on glass and pattern by wet etching process. And following this, SiNx and SiOx films were deposited as a gate insulator by PECVD. \n\nThe IGTO film was deposited by DC sputtering, and active IGTO was defined by wet etching process and annealed in a furnace in CDA atmosphere at 350 ℃\nfor 1 hr. Then, the Mo/Cu bi-layer was deposited subsequently as S/D electrodes and patterned by wet etching process. The passivation layer (PV1) was deposited by PECVD and the organic passivation layer was coated as the second passivation layer (PV2). After that, RIE process was used to open the contact via. Finally, the whole device was annealed in CDA at 250 ℃ for 1h. \n\nFigure 6 (a) shows the 10.7 inch 120 x 120 (x RGB) mini-LED display drivien by BCE IGTO TFTs. \n\nThe uniformity of transfer characteristics are shown in Figure 6 (b). The BCE IGTO TFTs represent the mobility of around 25 cm2V\n-1s\n-1and threshold voltage \n- 0.75V±0.1V, which could drive the mini-LED panel. \n\n![2_image_1.png](2_image_1.png) \n(a) (b)\n\n![2_image_3.png](2_image_3.png)\n\nBCE IGTO TFT stability characteristics are shown in Figure 7. Figure 7 (a) shows ΔPBTS (Vgs =\n30V, 60℃, and 3,600 sec) <2.6V and ΔNBTiS (Vgs= - 30V, 60℃, 4,500nit and 3,600 sec) <-3.4V. BCE \nIGTO structure TFTs have back channel damage issues during S/D wet etching process. Minimizing and recovering the back channel damage are the key processes. It is suggested that back channel damage during S/D patterning results in relatively large concentration of oxygen vacancy defects in IGTO compared to that of self-aligned coplanar structure. \n\nThese defects induce large threshold voltage shifts upon negative bias illumination stress. \n\n## 5. Summary\n\nIn this paper, we reviewed the crystallinity of IGTO film which represents the (222) plane of In2O3 structures. The higher power and O2 concentration, the larger (222) plane of In2O3 structures. The mobility of IGTO TFT is around 25 cm2V\n-1s\n-1 which is twice as big as conventional a-IGZO TFT. Threshold voltage is 0.3V±0.2V; ΔPBTS is <1.5V; and ΔNBTiS is <-1.0V \nfor self-aligned coplanar IGTO TFTs. In case of BCE IGTO TFTs, threshold voltage is -0.75V±0.1V; ΔPBTS is <2.6V; and ΔNBTiS is <-3.4V. We verified the IGTO TFT characteristics by fabricating the 31 inch 4K2K (144ppi) top emission IJP AMOLED driven by self-aligned coplanar IGTO TFTs and 10.7 inch 120 x 120 (x RGB) mini-LED display driven by BCE IGTO TFTs. High mobility oxide TFT is necessary for future applications such as high resolution OLED displays and self-luminous microLED displays.\n\n## Acknowledgment\n\nWe thank all the members at the R&D center for their support and cooperation. \n\n## References\n\n[1] Y-M.

The TGSA TFT with dual gate have two electron channel realizing the higher mobility than single gate TFT. The higher mobility make it possible for high resolution, high refresh rate and narrow-bezel design of LCDs. Therefore, combing with the source line DEMUX 1:2 circuit design, we fabricated a 14.5 inch notebook liquid crystal display (LCD) with resolution of 3K*2K successfully using the high performance TGSA TFTs, achieving the refresh rate of 165Hz and panel left and right border of 1.7mm. \n\nAuthor Keywords High mobility, Top Gate, Oxide TFT,High refresh rate,Narrow-bezel, DEMUX\n1. Introduction The flat-panel display products make steady progress in highresolution narrow-bezel designs nowadays. Amorphous indium gallium zinc oxide (a-IGZO) thin-film transistors (TFTs) have been widely used as TFT backplanes for medium or large-size liquid crystal display (LCD) and active-matrix organic lightemitting diodes (AMOLED) due to their high mobility, extremely low off-state current, large-area uniformity and electrical stability. However, the on-state current (Ion) of commercial aIGZO TFTs (~ 10 μA) is still not suitable for ultra-high resolution and narrow-bezel display products. We have developed a kind of superior oxide TFT technology which improves the on-state current of oxide TFT to over 60μA. Meanwhile it maintains other excellent characteristics of oxide TFTs such as low off-state current ~10 pA, low sub-threshold swing (SS) and electrical stability. According to the report 1, if the field effect mobility is twice as large as that of a normal IGZO TFT, the device width could reduce to half of the original size, while preserving the output current levels. Compared with traditional oxide BCE TFT structure, oxide TGSA TFT structure has smaller parasitic capacitance, which can further improve the on-state current; The channel is protected by gate insulation layer to avoid the damage of etching fluid, and the stability of TFT is better; The channel can be made smaller, conducive to narrow-bezel product development. Therefore the high mobility oxide TGSA technology make it possible for high resolution, high refresh rate and narrow-bezel manufacture of LCDs. In this paper, we introduce the TGSA TFT structure using high mobility oxide TFT technology which has high on-current 60μA and low SS 0.2V/dec. We have achieved 14.5 inch LCDs with high resolution, high refresh rate, narrow-bezel and low power consumption using high mobility oxide TFT technology and source DEMUX 1:2 design. \n\n## 2. Device Fabrication\n\nThe oxide TGSA backplane we fabricated requires 9 masks. Ti metal shading layer is deposited on the glass substrate by Sputter to avoid the impact of ambient light on the channel, Then SINx/SIO2 buffer layer is deposited by PECVD, the high mobility semiconductor IGZTO layer is deposited above the buffer layer, the material mobility can reach more than 20cm2/V·s [2]. SIO2 gate insulation layer is deposited. The next step is to deposit the Ti/Cu gate metal and pattern it. Gate insulation layer is etched by gate metal as mask and smaller channel length can be achieved. Then Plasma is used for conducting the semiconductor layer to reduce the contact impedance. Finally inner insulation layer SIO2/SINx and MoNb/Cu SD metal electrode are deposited.\n\nFigure 1. Section picture of oxide TGSA TFT structure for \n\n![0_image_0.png](0_image_0.png)\n\nLCD 9Mask The most critical part of the device manufacturing process is how to control the degree of conductor. In the plasma processing process, H can spread horizontally to form △L, as shown in Figure 2. Too strong conducting ability is easy to form short channel effect or directly make the device fail [3]. Lack of conducting ability will make the impedance larger, which resulting in a small open current. To solve this problem, we have made the following improvements:\n(Ⅰ). Reduce the annealing temperature of gate insulation layer to prevent excessive H in film layer from diffusing into channel. \n\n(Ⅱ). Increase the proportion of NO2 in the film forming of gate insulation layer and adopt low temperature film forming to reduce the content of H in film layer. \n\n(Ⅲ). Several methods have been proposed for reducing the oxide semiconductor resistance through plasma treatments [4, 5]. We choose He+Ar gas mixed regression. The conducting degree is easy to control and the damage to the semiconductor is small. Pure H2 conducting power is strong but not easy to control. \n\n(Ⅳ). Low temperature film formation is adopted for the inner insulation layer to reduce the diffusion of H in the film layer to the channel. At present, we have been able to control △L \nwithin 1μm, The improved results are shown in Table 1.\n\nFigure 2.

Results and Discussion \n\n![1_image_1.png](1_image_1.png)\n\nTo show the advantages of high mobility oxide (IGZTO) TGSA TFT, we have compared its transfer characteristics with normal IGZO BCE structure TFT. As shown in Figure 3, the normalized Ion of TGSA TFT has reached ~60 μA, 5-times higher than BCE TFT with normal IGZO. In addition, lower threshold voltage Vth and sub-threshold swing SS have also been noticed in TGSA TFT. The dual-gate driving and high mobility of IGZO can ensure the amount of electron in channel and fast filling-up of defect in TGSA TFT [6]. Meanwhile, the higher amount of electrons leads to the lower Vth and higher Ion. \n\nFigure 3.

Id-Vg curves and critical values of TGSA TFT with different channel width-length ratio W/L. We have carried out transfer characteristics measurement of TGSA TFT with different channel width-length ratio W/L: 5/12, 15/12, 30/12, 20/6, 30/6 and 150/6. As shown in Figure 4, TFTs present normalized Vth in the range of 0.15-0.45 V and Ion of 5865 μA. Fixing channel length, we can notice the typical changing tendency that Ion increases and Vth decreases with increasing W/L. To investigate the feasibility of industrial production, we have chosen 22 points on glass plate (2.5*2.2 m2) and conducted transfer characteristics measurement of TFT with W/L=160/5. The normalized values and plate mapping of Vth and Ion indicates good uniformity of TFT characteristics. \n\n![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png) \n\nFigure 5. Id-Vg curves and critical value plate mapping of TGSA TFT with width-length ratio W/L=150/6 at different test points on glass plate Based on the obtained results, the TGSA TFT with dual gate driving and high mobility IGZTO has been successfully produced on G8.5 line. The characteristics uniformity can ensure the promising future of its industrial production and daily application. We perform bias tests on the device. The positive bias voltage is 30V.

The specifications of the LCD are listed in the Table 4. The picture of the display shown in this paper is operating at 165Hz with good display quality. The high Ion and low leakage current support the narrow-bezel and high refresh rate design. The TGSA TFT replace the traditional BCE TFT without changing the GOA circuit driving structure, but could greatly improve the driving ability. This make the pixel charging easier in a shorter time. For the shown panel, the pixel charging ratio exceeds 90% at 165Hz. The GOA TFT W value has been designed smaller to reduce the GOA circuit layout space, achieving a 1.7 mm left and right panel border.

Conclusion In summary, we developed the high performance IGZTO TGSA TFT technology. The optimized process contributes the productive electronic properties of TFTs. The TFTs exhibit excellent uniformity and smaller △L within 1um. The Ion of TGSA TFT reached ~60uA, 5-times higher than normal IGZO \nBCE TFT. The △Vth under the positive bias stress of 30V and negative bias temperature illumination stress of -30V for 1 hours are +1.18V and -2.23V, respectively.

The TFT exhibits a saturation field-effect mobility of 20 cm2/V s, exceeding the mobility of 50 nm thick single layer reference TFTs fabricated with either material. The deposition temperature of the second layer influences the mobility of the underlying transport layer. When the cap layer is deposited at room temperature (RT), the mobility in the 310 -C deposited CAAC layer is initially low (6.7 cm2/V s), but rises continuously with time over 58 days to 20.5 cm2/V s, i.e., to the same value as when the second layer is deposited at 260 C. This observation indicates that the two layers equilibrate at RT with a time constant on the order of 5 106 s. An analysis based on diffusive transport indicates that the room temperature diffusivity must be of the order of 1 1018 cm2 s 1 with an activation enthalpy EA< 0.2 eV for the mobility limiting species. The findings are consistent with a hypothesis that the amorphous layer deposited on top of the CAAC has a higher solubility for impurities and/or structural defects than the underlying nanocrystalline transport layer, and that the equilibration of the mobility limiting species is rate limited by hydrogen diffusion, whose known diffusivity fits these estimates.

[http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4935026]\nToday's active matrix displays are based primarily on amorphous hydrogenated silicon (a-Si:H) thin film transistors (TFTs), but their relative low mobility (1 cm2/V s) and stability under electric stress and/or illumination increasingly limits their application in advanced displays. TFTs implemented using amorphous InGaZnO4 (a-IGZO), a material with 1 order of magnitude higher mobility, are therefore beginning to replace a-Si:H in high resolution displays.1,2 Research on IGZO, discovered as a TFT material in 2004 by Hosono,3 has improved the performance of TFTs by optimizing channel length and thickness,4 coping with edge effects,5 selecting optimal source/drain (S/D) ohmic6 or Schottky contacts,7 using high-k dielectric oxide materials such as ZrO2, 8 HfO2, 9 and Al2O3, 10 dual-gate structure,11,12 dual gate dielectrics,13 dual-active layer of ZIO/IGZO,14 and dual active layer of IGZOx with high/low processing oxygen ratios.15 Recently, Yamazaki reported an improvement in the reliability and stability of IGZO TFTs by fabricating TFTs using IGZO deposited as a nanocrystalline, c-axis aligned crystalline (CAAC) thin film.16,17 Compared with a-IGZO\nTFTs, CAAC TFTs were found to have an extraordinary low off-state leakage current, approaching yA/lm (1024 A/lm),\nwith potential applications in solid state memories.\n\nIn this paper, we extend the single CAAC based TFT by developing a dual layer IGZO TFT. The TFT channel is implemented in a 20 nm CAAC layer with a 30 nm deposited a-IGZO on top.\n\nSubstrates for these studies were pþ-type Si wafers with a 100 nm thermal oxide as the gate dielectric. A 50 nm thick dual IGZO layer was then deposited by RF sputtering\n(In2O3:Ga2O3:ZnO¼ 1:1:1), at 120W of RF power and in an Ar: O2 ratio of 9:1 and a pressure of 5 mTorr. The deposition temperature of the first 20 nm thick layer was varied between 300 -C and 350 C, the range in which previous work showed optimal CAAC formation.18,19 After deposition of the CAAC\nlayer, the substrate temperature was lowered, in situ, to 260 -C\nto deposit the second, 30 nm thick, a-IGZO capping layer; varying temperatures were explored for this capping layer from 260 -C to room temperature (RT). After fabrication, TFTs were furnace annealed for 30 min at 350 C in dry air.\n\nThe completed TFT structure is shown schematically in Fig. 1.\n\nFigure 2 show X-ray diffraction (XRD) from these layers as measured with a Rigaku Smartlab X-Ray diffractometer with a Cu Ka source. Samples deposited at RT and 260 -C exhibit weak scattering at 31, characteristic of amorphous IGZO, while the 310 -C films show strong diffraction from (009) planes at 30.0 6 0.1, 16 indicating a c-axis oriented\n\n![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)\n\n0003-6951/2015/107(18)/183503/5/$30.00 107, 183503-1 VC 2015 AIP Publishing LLC\ncrystalline structure. These X-ray profiles remained stable during subsequent processing.\n\nTo distinguish processing conditions, we use double subscripts (T310/260) to indicate dual layer films and to specify the deposition temperatures of the first and second layers. Single layer reference TFTs were also deposited, which we designate using a single subscript (T260).\n\nElectrical measurements were made at room temperature in the dark, using a Karl S€uss PSM6 probe station.\n\nTransfer characteristics were measured at VDS ¼ 10 V.\n\nSaturation field-effect mobility and turn-on voltage were determined by fitting the square root of the saturation current\n(IDS,sat), as a function of the gate voltage (VGS) using20\n\n$$\\mathrm{I_{DS,sat}}=\\mu\\times\\mathrm{C_{ox}}\\times{\\frac{\\mathrm{W}}{\\mathrm{L}}}\\times{\\frac{(\\mathrm{V_{GS}}-\\mathrm{V_{on}})^{2}}{2}},$$\n\nwhere l is the saturation field-effect mobility, W/L ¼ 200/50\n\n![2_image_1.png](2_image_1.png)\n\n(L was set at 50 lm to minimize contact effects21), and Cox ¼ 32.3 nF/cm2 is the gate capacitance.\n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)\n\nFigure 3 shows representative output curves of devices fabricated with 50 nm IGZO deposited at (a) T310, (b) T310/260\n(dual layer), and (c) T260 -C. The saturation current of devices constructed in single layer devices with either amorphous\n(T260) or CAAC (T310) are similar. This agrees with our work19 and literature findings21 that the mobility of a-IGZO\nand CAAC is similar, consistent with conduction dominated by the spherical s states of In. However, the saturation current approximately doubles when a-IGZO is stacked on top of the CAAC (T310/260). We deposited 20 nm and 50 nm pure CAAC films and fabricated TFTs using the standard process for comparison. As expected, the thin CAAC device shows degraded performance relative to the 50 nm device. The Von shifted positively by 10 V and the mobility is approximately half. With the thin CAAC, environmental contamination at the back channel interface has a much stronger effect on device performance. The total thickness of all the other devices measured in this work was kept at 50 nm to minimize this potential error.\n\nFigure 4 shows the electrical characteristics of these devices. Transfer characteristics are shown in Fig. 4(a) with summaries of the saturation mobility and turn-on voltage for the three conditions shown in Figs. 4(b) and 4(c), respectively. The measured saturation mobilities of the single layer T310 (CAAC) and T260 (a-IGZO) TFT\nwere 12.8 and 15.3 cm2/V s, respectively, whereas the mobility in the dual layer T310/260 device was 20.6 cm2/V s.\n\nThe turn-on voltages of single-layer T310 and T260 are 7.5 and 7.6 V, respectively, but lower, at 3.2 V, in the dual layer device.\n\nTo study the influence of the deposition temperature of the amorphous layer, we fabricated devices in which the first layer was, as before, deposited at 310 C, but with the second layer deposited at room temperature. Figure 5 shows output curves corresponding to (a) TFT made in a single layer deposited at T310, (b) in the dual layer T310/RT,\nand (c) in a single layer TRT. The output current is highest in the single layer CAAC device, but lower in room temperature and dual layer device, which now behave very similarly.\n\n![3_image_0.png](3_image_0.png)\n\nsingle-layer (T 310 and T RT ) IGZO was 12.8 and 6.4 cm 2 /V s, respectively, but the mobility of the dual layer was 6.7 cm 2 /V s. Deposition of the second layer at RT reduced the mobility in the channel layer below that measured in a single layer deposited at the same temperature. Turn-on voltages for T 310 and T RT films were 7.5 and 13.5 V, respectively. As in the case of T 310/260 devices, the turn-on voltage of the dual layer TFT\nremained lower than either single layer device at 3.5 V.\n\nFigure 6 shows that the sweep hysteresis width of the T310/RT devices (a) was much larger than that exhibited by devices deposited at T 310 and T RT ((b) and (c)), indicating that this dual layer device is in an unstable state, electrically and structurally. In Fig. 4 , there is no significant difference of off-state current between pure CAAC, pure amorphous (260 °C), and dual layer (CAAC + 260 °C) TFT. However, Fig. 6 indicates that films deposited at RT exhibit higher offstate currents compared to the elevated temperature devices. It should be noted that the measured currents are at upper limit only, and the true off-state currents are expected to be much lower than that observed in these measurements.\n\nFigure 7 shows the time dependence of the (a) saturation mobility and (b) turn-on voltage of T rt , T 260 , T 310 , T 310 / RT ,\nand T 310 / 260 devices stored in the dark in a clean room air after 0, 37, 44, and 58 days. The saturation mobility in dual and single-layer TFTs remained essentially constant, but the device to device variations narrowed with time. A notable exception was the T 310 / RT device in which the mobility rose from 6.7 to 20.5 cm 2 /V s after 38 days! Films deposited at elevated temperatures show relatively stable V on decreasing slightly with time (total shift < 2 V). In contrast, devices with films deposited at room temperature are unstable (both µ and V on ) with large positive shifts in V on over the 2 month period.\n\nPark et al. 22 also observed V on shifts which were attributed to the water desorption from the back surface of a-IGZO, with the sign of the V on shift depending on the film thickness. We believe that this instability of RT single layer deposited films is related to water or OH adsorption with time. In the dual layer T 310/RT device, the temporal changes in threshold and mobility are consistent with ionized hydrogen donors being lost.\n\nThis dual-layer device design was motivated by the con-\n\n![3_image_1.png](3_image_1.png)\n\nsideration that impurity solubility in the amorphous phase generally exceeds that in the crystalline phase. This wellknown fact is used in the Si semiconductor industry to move impurities from crystalline transport regions to nearby amorphous/disordered regions in a process known as internal gettering. 23 In addition, disordered regions in Si equilibrate point\n\n![4_image_0.png](4_image_0.png)\n\ndefect concentrations that otherwise would need to reach the surface to equilibrate. By analogy, we expected that an a-IGZO layer would getter impurities from the nanocrystalline CAAC phase and equilibrate defect concentrations during deposition.\n\nThe higher mobility in the dual-layer devices as compared with the single-layer devices confirms this to be the case when the capping layer is deposited at 260 ° C. At this temperature, gettering does appear to proceed all the way to the equilibrium since (i) the saturation mobility of the T 310 / 260 device is stable and (ii) the mobility of the (T 310/RT ) TFT, over a period of 2 months, moves to the value observed in the T310/260  sample.\n\nAn estimate on the diffusivity of the moving species can be made using the approximation x = 2 √ Dt , in which x is the layer thickness of 20 nm and t is 38 days. This yields a diffusivity of D RT ~ 10 − 18 cm 2 /s. As to the temperature dependence of D, one can make a rough estimate from the observation that the √ Dt product for the device activation anneal, 350 1 C for 30 min, is insufficient for the two layers to equilibrate in the T 319 / RT device, whereas they do equilibrate at room temperature over 38 days. The estimate is only first order, as exchange of hydrogen in the CAAC layer to the atmosphere is controlled by the permeability of the amorphous capping layer, i.e., the product of solubility and diffusivity. As the temperature dependence of the solubility is not known, we cannot take it into account. Such an estimate indicates that the activation energy of migration E A of the unknown species must be below ~0.2 eV. The activation energy is surprisingly low, but it is comparable to the value of 0.11 eV measured for the outmigration of hydrogen from IGZO measured by Nomura et al . 24 During out-diffusion of H from (2:2:1 oxide ratio) IGZO films, they observed two regimes. The estimated diffusivity from measurements below 200°C suggests a room temperature diffusivity of 1.8 × 10 −15 cm 2 s − 1 , while measurements above 300 ° C extrapolate to a room temperature diffusivity of 6.3 × 10 − 25 cm 2 Services However, these measurements were made as an exchange rate with deuterium and in a reducing environment (5% D 2 /95%\nN 2 ), while the current measurements indicate the direct loss of hydrogen with no replacement in an oxidizing environment (ambient air). Given these differing conditions and the approximations made, the current observed H diffusivity of 10 − 18 cm 2 s − 1 is in a comparable range and reasonably consistent with the higher exchange diffusivity measured by Nomura. The diffusivity derived from the layer equilibration kinetics is consistent with the movement of hydrogen. Thus, a model consistent with our observations is that hydrogen movement establishes equilibration between the two phases, and that the amorphous layer, in essence, acts as a \"buffer\" that keeps hydrogen content in the nanocrystalline CAAC\nlayer at a low and stable value.\n\nAt the surface of the amorphous capping layer, adsorption/desorption can take place. Other groups have seen the effect of O 25 and humidity 26 adsorption/desorption on unpassivated backchannel of IGZO TFT. In our case, the temperature/time changes indicate that hydrogen distributes itself between CAAC IGZO (known to contain hydrogen at the level\n\n![4_image_1.png](4_image_1.png)\n\nFIG. 7. Changes in electrical properties over time. (a) Saturation mobility and (b) turn-on voltage of IGZO TFTs deposited at substrate temperature of 310 C (CAAC), 310 C (CAAC)/\n260 C (amorphous), 310 ° C (CAAC)/\nRT (amorphous), 260 1 C (amorphous),\nand RT (amorphous) as a function of time stored in dark clean-room air.\n\nof 1  1020 cm3, Refs. 25 and 26) and amorphous IGZO,\nknown to contain hydrogen at the level of 5 10201 1022 cm3 (Refs. 21 and 26). This raises the question if sufficient hydrogen might escape from the free surface such that the capping layer no longer can buffer the hydrogen content of the CAAC. A simple estimate shows that the diffusivity of hydrogen at room temperature is too low to do so to a significant degree. Other observations indicate that the IGZO deposited in our group equilibrates on a similar time scale. For example, after laser annealing, we observe the mobility to decay in a few weeks from 50 to 30 cm2/V s.27 Other groups have seen similar decay constants, for example, in the decay of the temporary electric field induced high mobility in TFTs with a half gate top electrode in addition to a conventional gate.28 The similar relaxation times suggest that the underlying mechanisms may be identical.\n\nThe decreased mobility of dual-layer devices with the aIGZO deposited at room temperature can be understood as a stress effect arising from the two very different deposition temperatures that result in layers with different physical properties. In the language of oxide glass theory, the two layers have very different fictive temperatures but, being bonded together, are forced to thermally expand identically during the 350 -C activation anneal, leaving room temperature residual internal stresses after cool down from the activation anneal.\n\nAs H migrates, it rearranges strained bonds within the IGZO glass and hence relieves stresses in the film. The effects of stress and, more generally, the existence of an equilibrium state in IGZO can be accounted for in the modern, constraint based, theory of oxide glasses.29 Further improvements, in particular, optimizing the robustness of the equilibrium state, might be achieved by optimizing the deposition conditions of the two layers for other deposition systems.\n\nFrom a process engineering point of view, an additional benefit of the dual-layer device appears to be that the amorphous layer stacked on top of CAAC layer prevents environmental contamination from reaching the active transport layer, as indicated by the constant Von in unpassivated dual layer devices, compared to the drift in Von in single layer room temperature devices. In particular, the reduced sensitivity might be an advantage as the industry moves to eliminate the etch stop layer.\n\nCAAC/amorphous IGZO dual-layer IGZO TFTs, with the channel being implemented in the CAAC layer, were fabricated and characterized. These TFTs exhibit saturation field-effect mobilities of 20 cm2/V s, exceeding that achieved in reference TFTs using either a single layer of CAAC (13 cm2/V s) or a single layer of amorphous IGZO (15 cm2/V s).\n\nThe highest mobility of 20.6 cm2/V s was measured in TFTs in which the amorphous layer and CAAC layers were deposited at 260 C and 310 -C, respectively. In samples in which the amorphous IGZO layer was deposited at room temperature, the mobility improved over a period of months from initially 6.7 cm2/V s to 20.5 cm2/V s. This observation and the observation that device-to-device variation in all dual layer devices narrow with time suggest that equilibrium between the two layers is established at room temperature in 106 s. A model that assumes that the two layers equilibrate by the movement of hydrogen, which, as it moves, rearranges high stress bonds is consistent with our observations and the published diffusivity of hydrogen in IGZO.24 This work was supported by Corning Incorporated and made use of the facilities funded by NSF including equipment in the Cornell NanoScale Facility (ECCS15420819) and in the Cornell Center for Materials Research\n(NSF-MRSEC program DMR-1120296).\n\n1T.

Current research thrusts on AOS have focused on solution processed fabrication because it offers attractive advantages such as simplicity, versatility, and high material utilization [2]. In particular, large area fabrication at lower costs is an immense advantage of solution process over traditional vacuum methods. For high throughput large area fabrication, solution process fabrication should not be solely employed for the channel but for all TFT layers. Thus, the development of all-solution processed TFTs have been previously explored. Nevertheless, previous reports used various materials (organic, inorganic, hybrid, and metallic) with diverse or complicated fabrication processes and usually limited performance [3, 4]. Here, we show the fabrication of a high performance all-solution processed oxide TFT using a simple photo-induced process to selectively transform an AOS, aIZO, into a conductor. A single a-IZO layer can act as both the channel and electrode depending on the photo-induced activation area. Hence, additional processes and vacuum deposition systems are not needed to deposit separate source, drain, and gate electrodes making fabrication of all-solution processed TFTs simpler and quicker. TFTs fabricated using this facile method exhibit clear switching behavior and superb electrical characteristics. Thus, all-solution processed TFTs developed through photo-induced conductivity enhancement are promising for high throughput roll-to-roll fabrication of future large area devices.\n\n2. **Experiment**\nAn InZnO precursor (In:Zn = 77:23) was initially deposited by solution process (spin-coating) on a Si/SiO2 substrate followed by a 2-step baking process. This process was subsequently performed until a 50-nm-thick a-IZO layer is formed. A hybrid organicinorganic siloxane film [5, 6] was then spin-coated as the gate insulator. Another 50-nm-thick a-IZO layer was then spin-coated on top of the gate insulator using the same process used in the first a-IZO layer. The structure was then patterned and etched to form the structure shown in Fig. 1(a). Since there are no additional conductive materials deposited as gate, source, and drain electrodes, specific areas of the solution a-IZO layer are selectively converted to a transparent conductor using photoinduced process. The conversion was performed by irradiating the exposed a-IZO layers to either UV treatment at 115 °C for 15 min or a combination of UV treatment at 115 °C and a single shot of a KrF excimer laser (λ = 248 nm, pulsewidth = 9 ns, and beam W × \nL = 700 μm × 300 μm) at a fluence (F) of 120 mJ/cm2. Fig 1(b) \nshows the structure of the all-solution processed a-IZO TFT after the photo-assisted process. Fig 1(c) is the optical microscope image of the all-solution processed TFT.\n\n \nFigure 1. All solution processed TFT structure (a) before \n\n![0_image_0.png](0_image_0.png)\n\nand (b) after the selective photo-induced conductivity enhancement (c) top view of the all-solution processed TFT \nstructure (white bar = 100 μm) The electrical characteristics were analyzed by measuring the transfer characteristics of the all-solution processed a-IZO TFT \nbefore the selective photo-assisted process, after UV treatment \n(115 °C), and after a combination of UV and subsequent KrF \nexcimer laser annealing (ELA) at F = 120 mJ/cm2. The sheet resistance (RS) of a-IZO before and after photo-assisted process was characterized by four-point probe measurement. The effect of the photo-induced conductivity enhancement process on the interface and physical structure of the TFT was examined by Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM). Elemental diffusion and concentration before and after the photo-assisted processes were characterized by performing Energy Dispersive Xray (EDX) and Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) \nmeasurements. Bonding changes were also investigated through X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS)\n\n## 3. Results And Discussion\n\nTransfer characteristics of all solution processed a-IZO TFT \nbefore the photo-induced processes, after UV at 115 °C, and after a combination of UV and KrF ELA are shown in Fig. 2(a), 2(b), and 2(c), respectively. No switching characteristics is observed before any activation process which is not surprising because no source, drain, and gate electrodes were deposited. To selectively define and transform a-IZO regions to fulfill the role as source, drain, and gate, the all-solution processed a-IZO was subjected to UV treatment at 115 °C for 15 min. Here, the siloxane layer and the top a-IZO layer prevent UV from reaching the a-IZO channel which causes only the exposed a-IZO areas to selectively transform into conductors. The penetration depth is the inverse of the absorption coefficient (α) of a-IZO, so the penetration depth = \nα\n-1 of UV (254 nm) is at ~75 nm and KrF ELA (248 nm) at ~57 nm. Consequently, a single layer of a-IZO can act as both channel and source/drain electrode and the photo-induced conductivity enhancement is not only limited to the surface/upper layers of aIZO but affects the entire bulk of the 50-nm-thick a-IZO. \n\n![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)\n\nAfter UV treatment (Fig. 2(b)), clear switching characteristics are obtained similar to TFTs with conventional source, drain, and gate electrodes. Subsequent KrF ELA at 120 mJ/cm2after UV \nexposure further improves the transfer characteristics as exhibited by the higher on-current and smoother subthreshold (see Fig. \n\n2(c)). As shown in Table 1, the all-solution processed TFT before the photo-induced process has a mobility (μ) of less than 10-3 cm2/Vs. This μ improves to 8.02 cm2/Vs and 24.61 cm2/Vs after UV treatment and a combination of UV treatment with KrF ELA, \nrespectively. These μ are much better than those exhibited by previously reported all-solution processed TFTs [3, 4]. In general, the μ of most solution processed TFTs, especially all-solution processed TFTs, are quite poor (<5 cm2/Vs) due to several factors such as impurities from the precursor, incomplete metal oxide formation, and the difficulty in activating solution-processed channel layers. Here, the μ demonstrated by the all-solution processed TFT, particularly TFTs which were subjected to a combination of UV treatment and KrF ELA, showed an impressive μ that is among the best for all-solution processed TFTs. The threshold voltage (Vth) is also close to 0 V, especially for TFTs subjected to both photo-assisted processes ensuring low voltage operation. Table 2 shows the change in RS of as-fabricated a-IZO after UV treatment and KrF ELA. Both photo-induced process can reduce RS which increases the conductivity of a-IZO \nby 2 orders of magnitude up to 6.73 × 10-4 Ω∙cm. This is similar to our previous observations in vacuum processed a-IGZO where KrF ELA greatly increased the conductivity of a-IGZO to create transparent conductors with both high transparency and large conductivity [7]. \n\n| Before UV   | After UV   | After UV and  KrF ELA   |       |\n|-------------|------------|-------------------------|-------|\n| µ (cm2 /Vs) | <10-3      | 8.02                    | 24.61 |\n| Vth (V)     | -          | 3.07                    | 0.45  |\n| SS (V/dec)  | -          | 0.32                    | 0.29  |\n\nTable 2. Summary of sheet resistance (RS) of a-IZO after \n\n![1_image_1.png](1_image_1.png)\n\nphoto-induced conductivity enhancement\n\n| Method            | RS (Ω/□)   |\n|-------------------|------------|\n| As-fabricated     | 1.45 × 104 |\n| UV (115 °C)       | 1.35 × 102 |\n| ELA (120 mJ/cm2 ) | 2.98 × 102 |\n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)\n\nTo understand the conductivity enhancement mechanism, we performed additional characterizations to systematically analyze the changes in physical properties, composition, and bonding of aIZO after the conductivity enhancement. Fig. 3(a) indicates the area where the STEM cross section sample was extracted. The STEM cross-section images show well defined solution processed a-IZO and siloxane layers. The EDX measurements also reveal minimal diffusion of In and Zn between the main IZO layers through the siloxane. Both the STEM (Fig 3(b) and EDX analysis in Fig 3(d-f) confirm that the siloxane (gate insulator) properly isolates the top a-IZO (gate) from the first a-IZO layer which acts as both the source/drain and channel. Additionally, the STEM cross section images clearly demonstrates the self-aligned structure of the all-solution processed a-IZO TFT.\n\nSIMS was performed to analyze the changes in elemental concentration after the photo-induced process. From Fig. 4, the SIMS measurements show a slight increase of about one order of magnitude in the H concentration especially in the upper layers of a-IZO after UV treatment (115 °C). H is known to act as a donor in AOS because it forms hydroxides (OH) that produces extra electrons when ionized. Numerous studies have shown that increasing the H amount in AOS increases the carrier concentration and enhances its conductivity [8, 9]. A minimal increase is also observed in O concentration after UV. \n\nConsidering the relatively small increase in both H and O \nconcentrations, a different mechanism is likely mainly responsible for the conductivity enhancement of a-IZO. \n\nXPS analysis was performed to investigate the bonding changes that occur in a-IZO after the photo-induced process. Fig. 5(a), \nwhich compares the O 1s core level XPS spectra of a-IZO before and after UV treatment, shows a clear shift to a higher binding energy for the UV treated sample. The XPS shift to a higher binding energy suggests a higher concentration of metal oxide with oxygen vacancies (M-Odef) and metal hydroxides (M-OH). The deconvolutions of both O1s XPS measurements are shown in Fig. 5(b). The UV treated sample shows a 7% increase in the amount of M-Odef which can be related to the amount of oxygen vacancies (VO) in a-IZO. Generally, a VO increase leads to conductivity enhancement in AOS. Although the VO increase in aIZO is not as substantial as our previous observations with a-\nIGZO [7], the modest VO increase combined with the larger H \nconcentration is sufficient to enhance the conductivity of a-IZO \nup to 6.73 × 10-4 Ω∙cm. This enables a-IZO to fulfill its role as a transparent conductor as the source, drain and gate in high performance all-solution processed a-IZO TFTs.\n\nFigure 4.

Conclusion\n\nWe demonstrated a simple method to fabricate high performance all-solution processed oxide TFT through photo-induced conductivity enhancement processes such as UV treatment and KrF ELA. By selectively photo-inducing a semiconductor-toconductor transformation, a single a-IZO layer can act as both semiconductor (channel) and conductor (source/drain). Thus, allsolution processed TFTs with high μ up to 24.61 cm2/Vs can be fabricated using only three main layers without extra electrode depositions and not needing vacuum deposition systems. \n\nFurthermore, these photo-assisted processes ensure low substrate temperatures (115 °C) and are rapid (15 min (UV treatment) and <100 ns (KrF ELA)), rendering them attractive for high throughput roll-to-roll fabrication of high performance allsolution processed a-IZO TFTs. \n\n## 5.

        "text": "# High Performance Metal-Oxide Tft On Flexible Plastic Substrates Chan-Long Shieh, Guangming Wang, Juergen Musolf, Fatt Foong, Tian Xiao And Gang Yu Cbrite Inc., 421 Pine Ave., **Goleta, Ca 93117, Usa**\n\n## Abstract\n\nActive Matrix displays on light weight, non-fragile, plastic substrates are of great interests for portable applications. One of the challenges has been device performance processed at low temperature: in both carrier mobility and operation stability. Another challenge has been a TFT process flow without rigorous alignment among patterns in different layers. In this presentation, we present a MOTFT processed at low temperature, on PEN or PET substrates, with mobility above 50 cm2*/Vsec and with bias* stability sufficient for portable display products. TFT performance over large substrate size are guaranteed by a proprietary self-aligned process which enables large size display backpanel be made in roll-to-roll process with a flexible substrate. \n\n## Keywords Metal-Oxide Tft, Flexible, Display\n\n1. Introduction Many progresses have been made recently in the field of Metal Oxide Thin Film Transistors (MOTFTs). High mobility and good operating stability in broad temperature range have been achieved \n[1]. The mobility is as high as >60 cm2/Vs. The operating stability under positive bias stress, negative bias stress and current stress at 60 oC are so good that they are not only capable of driving LCD, \nbut also capable of driving the most demanding current driven devices such as OLED and semiconductor LED. All these performances can be achieved on MOTFT at process temperature similar to that used for a-Si TFT; e.g., < 300 oC. Such high performance MOTFT enables the display manufacture lines originally set up for a-Si TFT based products to be upgraded for next generation AMLCD and AMOLED displays. Thin film devices on non-fragile plastic sheet have also been a hot subject in display field for nearly 20 years. They are of special interest for portable applications for a variety of reasons including light weight, thin profile, non-fragility, flexibility and conformability to desired shapes. On the other hand, there have been challenges, on processing pixel array over such substrates for their high dimension instability to process condition changes. Another challenge comes from the thin-film layers processed at low temperature could not retain the performance demonstrated on glass at high process temperature. It has been proven a great challenge to modify the a-Si TFT or poly-Si TFT processes to make them work on plastic substrates by lowering the processing temperature: a-Si or poly-Si TFTs processed on plastic substrate not only suffer mobility and the switch ratio losses, but also show poor operating stability, under either voltage or current bias. \n\nSimilar issues may confront TFTs with amorphous metal-oxide semiconductor channel layer. For example, TFTs made with PVD processed metal-oxide channel layers often need annealing above 300 oC to achieve good mobility and stability. Channel layers made with solution processed methods (such as by sol-gel process) often needs higher annealing temperature [2]. A TFT \nprocessed at low temperature with sufficient mobility and stability is still an advanced topic in display industry. In this work, we present a non-IGZO based MOTFT on flexible substrate, processed at room temperature, and annealed below 180C. The mobility is above 50 cm2/Vsec and the biastemperature stabilities are sufficient for portable applications. \n\n2. Methods and Results Flexible PEN and PET films (4-6 mil) was used as the substrate. A buffer layer was coated on the PEN film by means of PECVD at low temperature. In addition to films above, flexible substrates from commercial sources (such as from KIMOTO, Japan) were also used in this study. We adopted the bottom-gate, top source/drain TFT configuration. Three types of processes were used in this study: (1) with an etch-stopper on top of channel area, (2) back-channel-etching (BCE), and (3) lift-off. Similar Id-Vgs, and high mobility were obtained on all cases. The BCE process reduces one mask level comparing to that with ES. It is more attractive for making TFT and display product with high pixel density. An aluminum alloy was used as the gate metal. It was patterned with standard photo process. The gate insulator was formed by means of anodization from the gate metal. High quality dielectric film was formed at room temperature with leakage current below 1 nA/cm2 at 10V and with dielectric constant of ~65 nF/cm2. The RC constant is typically in range of several hundred seconds, sufficient for display and image array applications. We note that such performance is superior to the dielectric films made from low temperature PECVD. A nonIGZO based metal-oxide was used as the channel layer and was deposited by either DC or RF sputtering at room temperature. In the devices with ES structure, a photo-patternable polymer was used as the ES. The etch-stopper was defined by a self-aligned process with the gate layer as a built-in mask. Using the selfaligned organic etch stopper, we can reduce the overlap capacitance between the gate and the S/D. TFT in such structure is of special interest for next generation information displays with higher pixel density and total pixel counts. The size of the plastic sheets used for this work was 3\"x3\" with the TFT test zones covered over 2.5\"x2.5\" area. No mis-alignment between the etch stop and the gate metal over the entire active area. The maximum substrate heating during the course of fabrication 160 oC. \n\nFig.1 shows a typical I d -V gs plot for Vds=1.0 and 10V.  It was taken from a TFT with W=200um and L=20um.  The \"OFF\"\ncurrent is saturated at 2x10 -13 A level, and the \"ON\" current reaches 2mA at ~13V.  The ON/OFF ratio at 13V is ~10 10 . The large switch ratio and the low \"OFF\" current offer great potentials for high pixel counts displays and for large size image arrays.   No short channel effect was observed in all test TFTs with different channel lengths, in great contrast to cases observed in a-Si and LTPS-TFTs. The sub-threshold swing is ~ 0.1-0.2 V/dec, reflecting high quality gate insulator and gate-channel interface.\n\nThe extrapolated electron mobility data are also shown in Fig. 1.\n\nLinear mobility reaches 55 cm 2 /Vsec at Vgs=15V and saturate mobility reaches 43 cm 2 /Vsec at Vgs=10V.  The TFT also shows superb current saturation in Id-Vds plot (as shown in Fig. 2):100MOhm was obtained at a few µ A level.  Such high output impedance enables uniform AMOLED to be made over large size flexible substrates.\n\n![1_image_1.png](1_image_1.png) ![1_image_3.png](1_image_3.png)\n\n![1_image_5.png](1_image_5.png)\n\nMost significantly, these TFTs possess high BTS stabilities in both forward and reverse biasing conditions.  Figure 3 and Fig. 4 showed the DC NBTS and PBTS at 20V, corresponding biasing field strength of 2MV/cm. During the stress test, the Id-Vgs data were sampled at Vds=1V after each 900 second time interval.\n\nVth (defined by Vgs at 10nA) shifts only -0.05V over 3600 seconds under Vgs=-20V and Vds=0.1V.\n\nVth shifts ~ +0.9V\nover 3600 seconds under Vgs=+20V and Vds=0.1V after 3600 These numbers are sufficient for certain display seconds.\n\napplications. They are also sufficient for digital image arrays and These TFTs also possess good operation bio-sensor arrays.\n\nstability. An accelerated current stress was carried out at 86uA\nfor 40 hours, the results are summarized in Fig. 5.  Vth shift saturates at ~0.3V during test period, and the current drop (under Vgs=Vds=3.8V) is ~11%.  Over 12 Coulombs of electrons passed the device during the current stress test.   Such current stability is sufficient for portable AMOLED display products.\n\nMI\n\n![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png) ![1_image_2.png](1_image_2.png)\n\n![1_image_4.png](1_image_4.png)\n\n![1_image_6.png](1_image_6.png)\n\nIt is worth to mention that, in the process flow we adopted, only one high quality mask is needed and is used for the first metal layer. Patterns in the following layers can be achieved by either self-aligned exposure with gate pattern as the built-in mask, or by means of a printing/laser writing method of which the process dimension can be adjusted to follow the substrate dimension change, or by their combination. With such strategy, thin film backpanel or electronic circuit in flexible form can be made over large size in a roll-to-roll process flow. \n\n3. Discussion and Remarks As a development vehicle, 4\" QVGA (320x240) digital image array was designed and fabricated. The pitch size of the imaging pixel is 250 um. The pixel readout circuit comprises a metaloxide TFT and a storage capacitor. The array of sensing elements are made of polymer photodiodes based on bulk D/A junctions \n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)\n\n[3]. Both MOTFT backpanel and polymer image array were processed below 160 oC. Expending the image readout circuit to more than 2 transistors, active pixel sensing (APS) circuit with gain at each pixel can be achieved [4]. The low off current and the large current switch ratio shown in Fig. 1-4 enables next generation flat-panel image array on large substrate in flexible or conformable form, with high image element counts, and with sensitivity to level only be achievable with CMOS wafers. The general trends observed in previous studies with silicon based (or even with early II-VI compound semiconductor based) channel materials are, one have to sacrifice performance (both mobility and stability) for TFT processed below 250 oC. In contrast, we present a MOTFT on PEN/PET substrate and processed below 160 oC with high mobility similar to those obtained on glass substrate at high process temperatures. The stability is reasonably maintained. The performance is sufficient for addressing certain applications such as portable displays, image arrays and bio/chemical sensor arrays. The process flow we adopted does not only fit with batch process, but also can be implemented with roll-to-roll process. In addition to their significance to flexible electronics, the high mobility and high stability semiconductor oxide thin films processed at temperature below 160 oC will certainly expend our understanding on material science and solid state physics. \n\n4.

Ltd, No. 668 Longzihu Rd, Hefei 230011, China Abstract\n\nTo improve electrical characteristics of top gate a-IGZO TFT we have been optimized the oxygen in IGZO layer and decreased the excess oxygen of Gate Insulator layer. We achieved that the uniformity of threshold voltages of a-IGZO \nTFTs on Gen. 8.5 glass is approximately 0.61V. Also, we achieved BTS characteristic about Δ0.1V at 2hr PBTS and Δ-0.2V at 2hr NBTiS. In addition, we demonstrated the 55-in 4K UHD OLED TV with high reliability Image sticking. \n\n## Keywords\n\nOxide Semiconductor, Thin Film Transistor, OLED Display, Image Sticking \n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nAs amorphous metal-oxide TFTs are expected to be a next-gen eration backplane technology for development of OLED and UHD displays they have been actively studied in the display industry [1, 2]. The devices have many advantages such as high mobility, low off-current, sharp sub-threshold slope, low temperature fabrication and good large-area uniformity. However, in the case of IGZO oxide TFTs, the diffusion of light elementals (hydrogen and oxygen) occur through the interface from the surrounding oxide insulator to the active layer, or from the active layer to the adjacent insulating layer during the fabrication process in a large OLED panel. The diffusion process can induce unexpected results such as the non-uniformity of Vth among, degradation of BTS (Bias Temperature Stress) stability, conductive behavior and color non-uniformity in the OLED panel. Particularly, the Oxide TFT in an OLED panel is a current-driving device and the immutability of Vth under BTS is very important for the accurate color expression and stable display operation. In short, the uniformity and stability of devices are crucial for backplane technology of large OLED displays, and the characteristics can be controlled through diffusion of light elements during the fabrication process. In this study, we investigated to improve Vth Uniformity and BTS characteristics of IGZO TFTs by minimizing the density of NBO site within gate insulator using optimized PECVD SiO2 deposition condition; additionally we optimized method of IGZO deposition for AKT Rotary Sputter. Consequently, we attained the robust IGZO TFTs and then Demonstrated of 55inch 4K OLED TV panel. \n\n## 2. Experimenet\n\nTop-gate coplanar a-IGZO TFTs were fabricated on a glass substrate [5]. In the device structure, the a-SiO2 layers and a-IGZO (In:Ga:Zn=1:1:1at%) channel layer were deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) at working temperature for reactant gases and DC sputtering at room temperature, respectively. After deposition and patterning of the Cu/MoNb gate electrode, source/drain (S/D) extension regions are self-aligned to the gate and are formed by dry-etching the exposed a-IGZO surface. \n\nInter-layer dielectric is deposited and patterned to form S/D contact holes. Cu/MoNb is used as the S/D electrode material. TFTs undergo thermal annealing treatments to achieve uniform and stable device performance. A SiO2 passivation layer and ITO pixel electrode is formed. Devices tested with a semiconductor parameter analyzer (Keysight B1500A).\n\n \n\n## 3. Result And Discussion\n\n3.1 Optimized Gate-Insulator & a-IGZO \n\n## Characteristics\n\nIn a-IGZO TFT structure, the GI SiO2 is typically deposited using the PECVD equipment and the PECVD deposition parameter can adjust the oxygen content in the SiO2 Film by changing it. \n\nFigure 1. is SiO2 Film characteristics used in this study. \n\nSingle Film characteristics by oxygen content level in SiO2 Film. The Oxygen content was analyzed using the FT-IR meter. As the position of the wavelengths of Si-O-Si stretching peak increases, the oxygen content in SiO2 film is higher. The oxygen content was verified experimentally, and we checked the peak value based on thermal oxide Si-O-Si stretching peak (1075). \n\n Figure 2. is a characteristic of IGZO Film according to the IGZO deposition method, and carrier density used the μ-PCD equipment to verify the characteristics of the peak value. Applied the new deposition method of IGZO Film, we see that the peak value more uniform. \n\n## 3.2 Electrical Characteristics\n\nTable 2. is a electrical characteristics of Old and New Device. New Device applied low oxygen content and new deposition method of AKT sputter for Uniformed a-IGZO Film. Figure 3 and 4. is a New Device I-V characteristic and BTS characteristic. Threshold voltage (Vth) is VGS where Id=10nA (at VDS=15V). PBTS measurements, a constant VGS of +20V is applied at 60C for 7200sec.\n\nFurther more, NBTiS measurements, a constant VGS of \n-20V is applied at 60C and 6000nit for 7200sec. New Device achieved that the uniformity of threshold voltages is approximately 0.78V. Also, New Device achieved BTS characteristic about PBTS ΔVth 0.1V and NBTiS ΔVth -0.2V at 7200sec.\n\n## 3.3 Panel Reliability Test Results\n\nTable 2. and Figure 5. is the result of an Image Sticking evaluation for a Panel of Old Device and New Device. It has been confirmed Still and Logo Image Sticking. Still Image Sticking evaluation method is to check the cognitive status of the Pattern after 10 min using the Black & White Pattern. Logo Image Sticking evaluation method is to check the CCTV Logo Pattern after 3hours.

Conclusion In summary, we investigated the electrical characteristics of optimized New Device and image sticking test of the 55\" 4K \nOLED TV Panel. To improve electrical characteristics of Top Gate a-IGZO TFT we have been optimized the oxygen in IGZO layer and decreased the excess oxygen of Gate Insulator layer.

        "text": "# High-Voltage Characteristics Of Top-Gate Amorphous Ingazno Thin-Film Transistors Yu Xin*, Changhui Fan**, Shengdong Zhang*** * School Of Electronic And Computer Engineering, Peking University, Shenzhen, China ** Institute Of Microelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China *** Active Matrix Display Beijing Engineering Research Center, Beijing, China\n\n## Abstract\n\nIn this paper, we investigated high-voltage characteristics of topgate amorphous InGaZnO thin-film transistors. Results indicate that the saturation current decreases at high drain bias. Moreover, the threshold voltage (Vth) positive shift after device biased at the high drain voltage and the shift magnitude become larger at shorter channel length devices. These observations are attributed to the fact that hot electrons were produced due to the strong drain to source electric field and trapped in the gate insulator. The device performance was recovered after 1000-s negative gate bias at 60 ℃.\n\n## Author Keywords\n\namorphous InGaZnO; thin-film transistors; top-gate; high drain bias,hot electrons.\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nIn recent years, amorphous oxide semiconductor (AOS) thin film transistors (TFTs) have attracted widespread concern [1]-[3]. The AOS TFTs show high carrier mobility, good transparency, excellent uniformity, and relatively low processing temperature [4]. \n\nUp to now, TFTs using a-IGZO as a channel material have been the most widely studied and have been put into small-scale applications. Top-gate a-IGZO TFTs have been fabricated and exhibited high electrical performances and stability. Compare to conventional staggered bottom-gate structure, self-aligned top-gate structure has a low parasitic capacitance which leads to a smaller signal delay and increases the operating speed of circuits [5, 6].\n\nDespite the various advantages of AOS TFTs as mentioned above, for a display application of switching and driving device, higher device performance and device instability still remain the most important and critical issues. Such as the instability under gate bias and temperature stress (BTS) [7] and gate bias and light illumination stress (BIS) [8]. A lot of studies have focused on the device design, performance estimation and device instability of aIGZO TFTs at low voltage for digital circuit application. However, further analysis of other considerations, such as high-voltage characteristics. Special phenomena occur under high drain bias for silicon-based devices, such as metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) and low temperature poly-crystallinesilicon (LTPS). Hot carriers were produce due to the strong drain to source electric field and the generated hot carriers on a siliconbased device cause impact ionization and hot carrier injection into interface between the semiconductor and the gate insulator caused by collision of lattice with hot carriers due to the small band gap of Si, and which can be increased the drain current (kink effect) and gate leakage current [9, 10]. However, few studies have investigated the electrical characteristics of a-IGZO TFTs at high drain bias for power device and circuit application.\n\nIn this work, high-voltage characteristics of top-gate amorphous InGaZnO thin-film transistors in both off and on states were investigated. Observe the phenomenon of the device under high drain bias. And then, we investigated the relationship between the high-voltage characteristics of the device and the channel length of the device. Furthermore, we analyzed the possible mechanism for this effect, and proposed methods for restoring device characteristics based on the mechanism.\n\n## 2. Device Fabrication And Measurement\n\nIn this work, we fabricate top-gate a-IGZO TFTs whose schematic cross section is shown in Fig. 1. First, a 40 nm thick a-IGZO film was deposited on a glass substrate by DC magnetron sputtering system at room temperature using a ceramic target \n(In2O3:Ga2O3:ZnO = 1:1:1 mol %). The power is 100 W and the working gas pressure is 0.44 Pa with a 47:3 flow rate of Ar and O2 gas mixture. The a-IGZO film was patterned to form active islands in wet etch. Then, the patterned a-IGZO was performed with 180 s N2O plasma treatment. Subsequently, a 200-nm-thick SiO2 film as the gate insulator was deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). Afterwards, an O2 annealing was performed for one and a half hours at 300 ℃, and a 150-nm-thick molybdenum (Mo) film was deposited by sputtering and patterned to form the gate electrode in a H2O2-based etchant. The exposed SiOx gate insulator was dry-etched by reactive ion etching (RIE). The bared IGZO at S/D region was then exposed to Ar plasma to form low resistance S/D. Next, a 200-nm-thick SiOx passivation layer was deposited by PECVD and etched to open the contact holes byRIE again. Finally, a 120-nm-thick Mo film was deposited and patterned to form the S/D electrodes. The high-voltage characteristics of the fabricated TFTs were analyzed by using an Agilent B1500 semiconductor parameter analyzer in a dark environment under ambient condition.\n\n![0_image_0.png](0_image_0.png)\n\n## 3. Results And Discussion\n\nFirst, high-voltage characteristics of top-gate amorphous IGZO \nTFTs were investigated in off state. Fig. 2(a) shows the curve of the drain current with different channel lengths as a function of the drain voltage from 0 V to 100 V at Vgs = -20 V. The device transfer characteristic curve before and after the above measurement is shown in Fig. 2(b). The results indicate that there is no surge in current when drain voltage varies from 0V to 100V. And the device characteristics are basically unchanged. Based on the above phenomenon, the device can withstand drain voltages of 100 V or higher in off state. \n\n![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)\n\n![1_image_2.png](1_image_2.png)\n\nW/L=100/100mm Vdsmax=65V\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 \nshows the output curves of a device with W/L=100/100 μm, and the maximum drain voltage reached 30 V and 65 V separately. \n\nThen the transfer curves were scanned at Vds = 10.1 V, as shown in Fig. 3(b). Results indicate that the saturation current was degraded at high drain bias, and the threshold voltage (Vth) positive shifts 13.21 V. The positive drift of threshold voltage may be the main cause of the current degraded. On this basis, we investigated the relationship between the phenomenon of current drop and positive threshold voltage drift and device channel length. The changes of device transfer characteristics of devices with different channel lengths before and after high voltage are shown in Fig. 4. Results indicate that the threshold voltage (Vth) becomes more positive with decreasing channel length after applying the same 50 V high drain bias. The specific values of the threshold voltage offsets for different channel lengths are shown in the Table. 1. For devices with different channel lengths of 100 μm, 10 μm and 5 μm, the threshold voltage offsets are 8.9 V, 13.36 V and 16.33 V after applying the same 50 V high drain bias.\n\n![1_image_1.png](1_image_1.png)\n\n![1_image_3.png](1_image_3.png)\n\nTable 1. The shift in threshold voltage before and after high \n\ndrain voltage at different channel length.\n\nW/L(μm) 100/100 100/10 100/5\n\n∆Vth 8.9V 13.36V 16.33V\n\nThese observations may be attributed to the fact that hot electrons were produced due to the strong drain to source electric field and trapped in the gate insulator, as shown in Fig. 5. As the drain voltage increases, the electric field strength in the channel increases. At this time, the electrons get enough energy to become hot carriers, and electron emission phenomenon will occur. And the hot electrons will be emitted into the gate insulator layer and partly trapped by defects in the gate insulator. The electrons trapped by the gate dielectric cause a positive drift in the threshold voltage, which leads to a degradation in saturation current.\n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)\n\nFigure 5. The schematic of hot electrons are trapped in the gate insulator.\n\nBased on the above mechanism, various methods have been used to restore the basic electrical characteristics of the device. Fig. 6 shows the recovery of the transfer characteristics of the device when placed the device one week, two weeks and with a negative gate bias at 60 ℃. The results indicate that some carriers trapped by the gate dielectric return to the active layer, and the number increases with the extension of the time in the environment, which leads to a partial recovery of threshold voltage. And the device characteristics were basically restored to original state after 1000-s negative gate bias at 60 ℃. At this time, the electrons injected into the gate insulation due to the hot carrier effect basically return to the channel. Fig. 7 shows the recovery of the output characteristics of the device when placed the device one week, two weeks and with a negative gate bias at 60 ℃. With the basically recovery of the threshold voltage, the current also back to the initial magnitude after 1000-s negative gate bias at 60 ℃. The restoration of device characteristics also confirms the rationality of the above mechanism.\n\n![2_image_2.png](2_image_2.png)\n\n![2_image_1.png](2_image_1.png)\n\n Vgs=-20V\n(under 60℃)\n\n## 4. Conclusion\n\nIn our work, high-voltage characteristics of top-gate amorphous InGaZnO thin-film transistors were investigated. It is shown that in off state, the device can withstand drain voltages of 100 V or higher and the device characteristics are basically unchanged. Next, we investigated electrical characteristics of top-gate amorphous IGZO \nTFTs at high drain bias in on state, the current degraded and the threshold voltage (Vth) positive shifts high drain bias. And the threshold voltage (Vth) becomes more positive with decreasing channel length. These observations may be attributed to the fact that hot electrons were produced due to the strong drain to source electric field and trapped in the gate insulator. Based on the above mechanism, the characteristics of the device basically restored to its original state after 1000-s negative gate bias at 60 ℃.\n\n## 5.

Examples of active flexible applications include paper displays and wearable computers1. So far, mainly flexible devices based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H)2–5 and organic semiconductors2,6–10 have been investigated. However, the performance of these devices has been insufficient for use as transistors in practical computers and current-driven organic light-emitting diode displays. Fabricating high-performance devices is challenging, owing to a trade-off between processing temperature and device performance. Here, we propose to solve this problem by using a novel semiconducting material—namely, a transparent amorphous oxide semiconductor from the In-Ga-Zn-O system\n(a-IGZO)—for the active channel in transparent thin-film transistors (TTFTs). The a-IGZO is deposited on polyethylene terephthalate at room temperature and exhibits Hall effect mobilities exceeding 10 cm2V21 s 21, which is an order of magnitude larger than for hydrogenated amorphous silicon. TTFTs fabricated on polyethylene terephthalate sheets exhibit saturation mobilities of 6–9 cm2V21 s 21, and device characteristics are stable during repetitive bending of the TTFT sheet.\n\nThin-film transistors (TFTs) are fundamental building blocks for state-of-the-art microelectronics, such as flat-panel displays and system-on-glass11,12. Furthermore, the fabrication of low-temperature TFTs will allow flexible large-area electronic devices to be developed. These devices are flexible, lightweight, shock resistant and potentially affordable—properties that are necessary for large, economic, high-resolution displays, wearable computers and paper displays1. Further, when combined with 'transparent circuit technology'13–17, TFTs can integrate display functions even on the windscreens of cars.\n\nOrganic semiconductors and hydrogenated amorphous silicon\n(a-Si:H) have been extensively investigated for flexible electronics, and have demonstrated the ability to be fabricated into flexible solar cells and TFTs2–10. However, device performance is limited by the low mobilities of the channel materials (field effect mobilities, mFE,\nare ,1 cm2V21 s 21 for a-Si:H, ,2.7 cm2V21 s 21 for a pentacene single crystal, and ,1.5 cm2V21 s 21 for a pentacene thin film10). In addition, Si-based devices are of less interest for transparent circuits because they are not transparent, owing to the small bandgap18.\n\nAmorphous semiconductors are preferred over polycrystalline ones for active layers from the viewpoints of processing temperature and uniformity of device characteristics. However, the carrier mobility of a-Si:H is lower by two or three orders of magnitude than that of single-crystalline Si (,200 cm2V21 s 21 for carrier concentration ,1019 cm23). The mobility of a-Si:H is limited to\n,1 cm2V21 s 21, as carrier transport is controlled by hopping between localized tail-states and band conduction is not achieved. The low mobility is associated with the intrinsic nature of the chemical bonding (Fig. 1a): average carrier transport paths in covalent semiconductors such as a-Si:H consist of sp3 orbitals with strong directivity and, therefore, the bond angle fluctuation significantly alters the electronic levels, leading to somewhat highdensity deep tail-states.\n\nIn contrast, degenerate band conduction and large mobility\n(.10 cm2V21 s 21) are possible in amorphous oxide semiconductors (AOSs) containing post-transition-metal cations19,20. These features are completely different from those of the covalent semiconductors. Figure 1b illustrates the carrier transport paths (that is, the wavefunction of the conduction band bottom) in AOSs. The bottom of the conduction band in the oxide semiconductors that has high ionicity is primarily composed of spatially spread metal ns orbitals with isotropic shape (here n is the principal quantum number), and direct overlap among the neighbouring metal ns orbitals is possible. The magnitude of this overlap is insensitive to distorted metal–oxygen–metal (M–O–M) chemical bonds that intrinsically exist in amorphous materials21,22. Therefore, AOSs exhibit Hall-effect mobilities similar to those of the corresponding crystalline phase, even if they are formed at room temperature.\n\nThese carrier transport properties are unique to oxide semiconductors, and are not seen in covalent amorphous semiconductors such as a-Si:H.\n\nHere we report room-temperature fabrication and performance of flexible TTFTs fabricated using a-IGZO as an active n-channel\n..............................................................\n\n## Room-Temperature Fabrication\n\nof transparent flexible thin-film transistors using amorphous oxide semiconductors 488  © \n\nlayer. Films of a-IGZO were prepared by pulsed laser deposition with a KrF excimer laser, using a polycrystalline InGaZnO4 target at room temperature in an oxygen atmosphere (oxygen pressure PO2 ).\n\nThe chemical composition of the obtained films measured by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy was In:Ga:Zn ¼ 1.1:1.1:0.9 (in atomic ratio).\n\nFigure 2a shows an X-ray diffraction pattern of an a-IGZO film deposited on a glass substrate. The film is amorphous and optically transparent in the entire visible and near-infrared regions (wavelength l ¼ 390–3,200 nm), as shown in Fig. 2a inset. The optical transmittance is greater than 80%, including the reflection associated with the film and glass substrate. The optical bandgap (Eg)\nestimated from the Tauc' plot is ,3.0 eV, which is similar to that of the crystalline phase (,3.4 eV). The electrical conductivities at room temperature are ,1025 S cm21 when the films are deposited at PO2 . 6 Pa. The values correspond to carrier concentrations of ,1014 cm23 if an electron mobility of 1 cm22V21 s 21 is assumed.\n\nThe sign of the Seebeck coefficients obtained from thermopower measurements is negative, indicating that a-IGZO is an n-type semiconductor.\n\nFigure 2b shows the room-temperature Hall mobility of a-IGZO\nfilms as a function of carrier concentration. This carrier concentration varies from ,1014 to 1020 cm23 when PO2 is varied from ,7 to 0.1 Pa. The data obtained on single-crystalline InGaO3(ZnO)5\n(c-IGZO) films are shown for comparison. We have reported23 that carrier transport in c-IGZO is governed by percolation conduction over the distribution of potential barriers around the conduction band edge; these potential barriers are formed owing to random distribution of Ga3þ and Zn2þ ions in the crystal structure. The potential barriers are overcome when carrier concentration exceeds 3 £ 1018 cm23, and therefore the Hall mobility increases as the carrier concentration increases, and larger Hall mobilities\n(.10 cm2 V21 s 21) are obtained at carrier concentrations\n.1018 cm23. Similar behaviours are also observed in a-IGZO,\nwhich would result from a similar mechanism associated with the random amorphous structure.\n\nThe amorphous phase is thermally stable up to ,500 8C in air.\n\nOther AOSs such as a-ITO, and also crystalline ZnO (an amorphous phase of ZnO has yet been reported), have high-density carriers even in as-deposited states, and are difficult to make into devices with controlled characteristics. Thus it is vital to choose a material in which carrier concentration can be controlled at a low level, for example, ,1014 cm23, in order to achieve a low off current and large on-to-off current ratios24. Incorporating Ga ions would be important in a-IGZO for suppressing carrier generation via oxygen vacancy formation, because the Ga ion forms stronger chemical bonds with oxygen than Zn and In ions.\n\nWe fabricated top-gate flexible TTFTs using the a-IGZO film as an n-channel active layer on 200-mm-thick polyethylene terephthalate (PET) films (Fig. 3a). Source, drain, gate contacts and a gate insulator were defined by standard photolithography and lift-off techniques. A ,140-nm-thick Y2O3 layer was chosen for the gate insulator and ITO (Sn:10%) was used for source, drain and gate transparent electrodes. These layers were deposited by pulsed laser Figure 1 Schematic orbital drawings for the carrier transport paths (that is, conduction\n\n![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)\n\n![1_image_1.png](1_image_1.png)\n\nband bottoms) in crystalline and amorphous semiconductors. a, Covalent semiconductors have carrier transport paths composed of strongly directive sp 3 orbitals, so structural randomness greatly degrades the magnitude of bond overlap, that is, carrier mobility.

The measured dielectric constant of the Y2O3 gate insulator was ,1610 (where 10 is the dielectric constant of vacuum), which is close to that reported for crystalline Y2O3 (,1810)\n25. The channel length and width were 50 mm and 200 mm, respectively (Fig. 3c).\n\nThe performances of the flexible TTFTs were measured in air at room temperature. Figure 4a shows typical source-to-drain current\n(IDS)–voltage (VDS) characteristics of a virgin device. The current IDS markedly increases as VDS increases at a positive gate bias (VGS),\nindicating that the channel is n-type. The IDS reaches ,0.02 mA at a VGS of 5 V. The IDS–VDS characteristics exhibit a clear pinch-off and current saturation, confirming that the TTFT operation follows the standard field-effect transistor theory. The saturation mobility\n(msat) is obtained from the IDS–VDS curves in the saturation region using the equation IDS,sat ¼ (CimsatW/2L)(VGS 2 VT)\n2, where Ci, VT, W and L denote the gate capacitance, threshold gate voltage, channel width and length, respectively. The estimated msat value is\n,8.3 cm2V21 s 21, much larger than those obtained in organic and a-Si:H TFTs (the msat value ranges from ,6 to ,9 cm2V21 s 21 in Figure 2 Amorphous IGZO films. a, Glance angle X-ray diffraction pattern of the a-IGZO film deposited on a silica glass substrate at room temperature.

Similarly, a field-effect mobility (mFE)\n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)\n\n![2_image_1.png](2_image_1.png)\n\nestimated from the linear region in the IDS–V DS curve (using I DS ¼ (CimW/L)(VGS 2 VT)V DS) is ,5.6 cm2 V21 s 21 at VDS ¼ 2.4 V, which agrees roughly with the msat value.\n\nThe transfer characteristic (Fig. 4b) shows that a low off-current, of the order of 1027A, and an on-to-off current ratio ,103 are obtained. The threshold gate voltage is positive (VT < þ1.6 V),\nshowing that the TTFT operates in the enhancement mode (normally-off characteristics). The gate leak current is lower by several orders of magnitude than the source-to-drain current, which guarantees that the TFT characteristics are unaffected by the gate leak current. Small hystereses were observed in the IDS–VGS curves with negative shifts in gate bias of 0.1–0.5 V at a scan speed of 0.5 V s21, which would be due to interface states.\n\nNext, bending effects on the TTFT characteristics were examined.\n\nFigure 3 Flexible TTFTs. a, Structure of TTFT fabricated on a plastic sheet. b, A\nphotograph of the flexible TTFT sheet bent at R ¼ 30 mm.

The TTFTafter bending maintained good characteristics, such as msat < 7 cm2V21 s 21 and an on-to-off current ratio of ,103 (Fig. 4c, d). We stress that the TTFT\nperformance is almost unaffected by bending, although a slight decrease is observed in the saturation current. After the initial bending, the TFT characteristics are stable and reproducible during and after repetitive bending. The TTFT is stable at temperatures up to 120 8C, but becomes inoperative at higher temperatures, probably owing to the softening of the PET substrate.\n\nThe present study demonstrates the room-temperature fabrication and operation of flexible TTFTs based on an amorphous oxide semiconductor, a-IGZO. TTFTs were fabricated on inexpensive polymer films and displayed good performance—such as saturation mobilities of ,6–9 cm2V21 s 21, a low leak current of ,10210A,\nand an on-to-off ratio of ,103—even during and after bending. We used pulsed laser deposition to form the active a-IGZO layer in this study, but a sputtering or metal-organic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD) method can be used for large-area uniform deposition and mass production, as demonstrated for window electrodes of solar cells and flat-panel displays.\n\nThese achievements imply that transparent amorphous oxide semiconductors have the potential to overtake a-Si:H, and are promising materials for transparent flexible electronics. Furthermore, flexible TTFTs may be integrated with other alreadydeveloped devices that use a p-type amorphous oxide semiconduc491 © \n\ntor and p–n junction diodes fabricated at room temperature26; this\n\nwould extend the possibilities of flexible transparent electronic\n\ncircuits.

Recent developments in the description of the interaction of colloidal particles with short-range attractive potentials have led to interesting findings including metastable liquid–liquid phase separation and the formation of dynamically arrested states (such as the existence of attractive and repulsive glasses, and transient gels)1–7. The emerging glass paradigm has been successfully applied to complex soft-matter systems, such as colloid–\npolymer systems8 and concentrated protein solutions9. However, intriguing problems like the frequent occurrence of cluster phases remain10–13. Here we report small-angle scattering and confocal microscopy investigations of two model systems: protein solutions and colloid–polymer mixtures. We demonstrate that in both systems, a combination of short-range attraction and long-range repulsion results in the formation of small equilibrium clusters. We discuss the relevance of this finding for nucleation processes during protein crystallization, protein or DNA self-assembly and the previously observed formation of cluster and gel phases in colloidal suspensions12–17.\n\nA number of globular proteins have been shown to exhibit the major characteristics of colloids that interact via a short-range attractive potential. At high ionic strength, where the salt screens electrostatic repulsions, these short-range attractions increasingly dominate with decreasing temperature. This leads to a metastable liquid–liquid phase separation and related critical phenomena18–20.\n\n492  © \nIn agreement with predictions from mode-coupling theory9, there is also evidence for a glass or gel transition at low particle volume fractions and high interparticle attractions. Such a scenario obviously affects the ability to form the high quality crystals required for protein crystallography15. Using two apparently quite different model systems, we demonstrate the generality of this emerging description of the effect of a short-range attraction combined with either a hard or soft repulsion on the phase behaviour of a wide range of colloidal suspensions.\n\nWe first investigated solutions of the globular protein lysozyme\n(molecular mass 14.4 kDa, radius R m < 1.7 nm)17–19. Using smallangle X-ray (SAXS) and neutron (SANS) scattering, we studied spatial correlations in concentrated solutions at low ionic strength, where the long-range repulsive electrostatic potential is only weakly screened. We then compared these findings with confocal microscopy results using colloid–polymer mixtures, a popular model system with easily tunable interactions. Here we used spherical colloidal particles interacting with a long-range repulsion resulting from a modest charge21 and a short-range attraction induced by a polymer-mediated 'depletion effect'22.\n\nFigure 1 presents SAXS measurements on a lysozyme concentration series at 5 8C.

Fujii, Mutsunori Uenuma, Yasuaki Ishikawa Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Nara, Japan\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe existence of hot carriers in an oxide thin-film transistor was confirmed by using an emission analysis technique. It has been clarified that degradation due to hot carriers causes degradation phenomena such as a decrease in on-current without shift in threshold voltage, which has not been seen so far, in high-mobility device. Moreover, it was confirmed by photo emission analysis that the main degradation factor was hot carriers against dynamic stress in which a pulse voltage was applied to the gate.\n\n## Author Keywords\n\nOxide semiconductors; thin-film transistor; InGaZnO; Hot carrier; Reliability; Emission microscope; Photo emission; dynamic stress; Pulse\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nOxide semiconductor-based thin-film transistors (oxide-TFTs) \nare attracting attention as driving devices that realize nextgeneration large-screen displays and flexible displays. However, it is difficult to maintain reliability against electrical and optical stress compared to low temperature polycrystalline Silicon (LTPS). As the general degradation phenomenon, there are reports of the threshold voltage shifts against positive voltage and negative voltage application, and a shift in the negative direction of the threshold voltage against light irradiation under a negative voltage [1]. These phenomena are reported to be threshold voltage shift due to charge trapping at the semiconductor bulk or at the interface between semiconductor / gate insulator. On the other hand, there are reports suggesting the hot carrier generation under electrical stresses such as a strong drain electric field or high drain current; however, its existence has not been clarified [2-4]. Therefore, in this work, a hot carrier generation in oxide-TFTs was confirmed by analyzing the less intense photo emission in detail while applying a stress voltage to the TFT, and the degradation mechanism due to the hot carrier generation was discussed. Furthermore, by investigating the change of TFT characteristics while applying a pulse voltage to a high-mobility oxide-TFT, we discovered that hot carriers are one of the significant degradation phenomenon during circuit operation.\n\n## 2. Experimental\n\nThe bottom gate type oxide TFTs were fabricated. InGaZnOx\n(IGZO) and InWZnOx (IWZO) were deposited by sputtering as channel films. As the gate insulator, thermally oxidized-SiO2 was used. In this experiment, we used a emission microscope (Hamamatsu Photonics K.K. PHEMOS-200) with photon counting camera to detect the photo emission from the TFTs during actual operation, as shown in Fig. 1. This system consists of a photon-counting camera with a GaAs photo cathode. The wavelength sensitivity range of this camera was 500 to 900 nm based on its spectral sensitivity characteristics. By superimposing with a microscopic image, the two-dimensional emission intensity distribution through with and without several optical bandpass filter are confirmed. The spectral sensitivity of the photon-counting camera, the transmittance of filters, and the lenses were corrected to compare the photon counts obtained with different bandpass filters.\n\n## 3. Experimental Results\n\n![0_Image_0.Png](0_Image_0.Png)\n\n3.1 Analysis of photo emission under DC voltages 3.1.1 Demonstration of hot carrier effects in IGZO-TFTs First, we tried to observe and demonstrate photo emission and hot carrier effects in conventional oxide-TFT using IGZO channel. [5] For emission analysis, an etching-stopper type IGZO-TFT was adopted. Its field-effect mobility of 11.1 cm2/Vs is typical compared with other IGZO-TFTs. Surprisingly, the photon emission near the drain edge of the TFT was observed when a constant drain voltage (Vd) =30 V with gate voltage (Vg) =12 V, as shown in Fig. 2. \n\n![0_image_1.png](0_image_1.png)\n\nFig. 2 Emission image of the IGZO-TFT obtained from the emission microscope without band pass filter. This image was obtained by photon-counting camera. [5]\n\n![1_image_1.png](1_image_1.png)\n\n![1_image_2.png](1_image_2.png)\n\nMoreover, electric characteristics were also evaluated to clarify that the photon emission is induced by hot carrier effects. The capacitance–voltage characteristics indicated that the potential barrier was formed at the drain region to cause a local depletion state when the TFT was driven at Vd of 30 V. [5] In addition, the transfer characteristic measurements with Vd and source voltage Vs were performed to ensure the existence of potential barrier at the drain region. Fig. 3 shows the transfer characteristics of IGZO-TFT operated at Vd=30 V or Vs=30 V. After the first consecutive forward sweeps with Vd=30 V, the TFT exhibited no shift and completely overlapped in threshold voltage. In the case of the second consecutive forward sweeps with Vs of 30 V, the TFT showed a large positive shift in Vth from the transfer characteristics compared with Vd operation. This phenomenon is typical of hot carrier-induced degradation mode in Si-based transistors. It indicates that the existence of potential barrier at the drain region and hot carrier-induced degradation was occurred in the IGZO-TFT.\n\nFrom the relationship between the photon emission and the degradation in electrical properties, a possible conclusion would be that the photon emission from the IGZO-TFT was induced by hot carrier effects. These results demonstrate that hot carrier effects should be considered as a significant degradation mode for high-performance oxide-TFTs. 3.1.2 Bias dependence of emission intensity A top-contact/bottom-gate type IGZO-TFTs were used. The voltage dependency on the photo counts is shown in Fig. 4. The photo counts increases monotonously as the Vd increases; however, the photo counts-Vg characteristic shows a peak at about the Vg at ½ of Vd. Although not shown in the figure, it strongly depends on the gate length, and for the same bias voltage, the photo counts increased as the gate length became shorter. Therefore, it was found that this photo emission strongly depends on the drain electric field. Note that unlike self-heating, it does not depend monotonously on the Vg and is not due to the current itself. 3.1.3 Wavelength dependency on photo counts Next, the wavelength dependency was investigated using the optical bandpass filters. The results are shown in Fig. 5. Photo emission was mainly in the range of 600 to 800 nm, and within this range, the photo counts became stronger with longer wavelengths. From this dependence, it was suggested that the energy of this photo emission that it was not the band edge photo emission of the IGZO. In the Si-based transistors, a detailed investigation of the relationship between the photo counts and the wavelength, it is considered that the photo emission follows the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution and is due to intra-band transition such as hot carrier scattering or bremsstrahlung. [6] However, we consider that further investigations are required to clarify the photon emission mechanism in oxide-TFTs.\n\n## 72 - Sid 2020 Digest\n\n![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)\n\n![1_image_3.png](1_image_3.png)\n\n![1_image_4.png](1_image_4.png)\n\n3.1.4 Kink current analysis It is reported that the amount of photo emission is closely related to the kink current in Si-based transistors [6]. Therefore, the kink current in the high Vd region of the output characteristics was extracted as shown in Fig. 6. The kink current was obtained from the difference between the tangent line drawn at the inflection point of the drain current. As a result, it became clear that the kink current does not depend monotonously on the gate voltage and shows a peak with respect to the gate voltage. Fig. 7 shows the relationship between the photon counts and the kink current at each Vg. As a result, the emission intensity showed a gate voltage dependence very similar to the kink current. From this relationship, it has been clarified that photo emission is caused by an impact ionization phenomenon that occurs in a high Vd region, that is, a hot carrier phenomenon. 3.2 Hot carrier-induced degradation in high-mobility oxide-TFTs 3.2.1 Degradation under DC stress in high-mobility IWZO-TFT\nToday, high-mobility oxide semiconductor that exhibit electron mobility far exceeding 10 cm2/Vs have been developed to realize high-resolution displays, high frequency operation in driver circuit. In this case, there is concern about hot carrierinduced degradation may worsen as the performance improves of oxide-TFTs. [2] Thus, understanding of degradation mechanism and its evaluation techniques of high-mobility oxide-TFTs are strongly required. The improvements of reliability in highmobility oxide-TFTs continues to be a challenge in the immediate future.\n\nIn this work, we focused on the IWZO as the high-mobility oxide semiconductor. The fabricated IWZO TFT achieved mobility of over 40 cm2/Vs. The conventional positive bias stress \n(PBS) and negative bias stress (NBS) were carried out. Figure 8 shows the reliability of the IWZO-TFTs under DC stresses. These TFTs have no significant degradation in threshold voltage, oncurrent, and subthreshold swing (SS) even when DC voltage stresses are applied, as shown in Fig. 8.\n\nFig. 9 compares the degradation behaviors caused by bias stress only due to Vg application with the degradation caused by bias stress in which photo emission was observed. Degradation of transfer characteristics due to high-Vd with Vg under photo emitting condition is remarkable, no change in threshold voltage and only decrease in on-current are observed. Such a degradation phenomenon has not been reported so far, and it can be determined that this is a characteristic degradation of hot carrier generation. We discovered a unique degradation phenomenon under DC stress in high-mobility oxide-TFTs. 3.2.2 Analysis of dynamic stress in oxide-TFTs As a new application accompanying the improvement of the performance of a TFT, circuit application is attracting attention. However, at present, the performance of the p-type oxide TFTs are not so high, and LTPO by combining an n-type oxide TFT and a p-type LTPS is regarded as promising [7].In such a circuit, there is a possibility of performance degradation in pulse driving. Therefore, a pulse voltage was applied to the gate and the change in TFT characteristics was investigated. We have already reported the reliability under AC stress of the IGZO-TFT, as show in Fig. 10. [8] We observed unique degradation under AC stress for SS values that are not typically observed under DC bias stress in IGZO-TFTs. To further investigate this degradation, the degradation amount was compared by changing the various transition times of gate pulse, as shown in Fig. 11. From these comparisons, it was obviously dependent on the falling time of pulse voltage. We found that the shorter transition of falling greater the TFT degradations. This behavior follows the LTPS degradation mechanism. We concluded that high-energy electrons form a defect level at the interface between IGZO and gate insulator during the falling edge of the gate pulse. The existence of hot carrier during AC operation was suggested according to these results.\n\nIn this paper, we introduce a new experiment using IWZO-TFT, \nwhich has high-mobility. 3.2.3 Instability of high-mobility oxide-TFT under pulse stress When gate pulse stress as a AC stress was applied to the IWZO-TFT, as shown in Fig. 12, the threshold voltage did not essentially changed, the on-current and subthreshold swing value degraded significantly, and the behavior was different from the \n\n## Invited Paper 7-2 / Y.

In other reports, the major \n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png) degradation mode under AC stress in conventional oxide-TFTs is the shift in threshold voltage.

Accumulated electrons when a positive voltage is applied to the gate, are swept out to the source and drain electrodes when a negative voltage is applied. At this time, a high electric field is applied under electrode edges, electrons obtain high-energy from the electric field, hot carriers are generated. Accordingly, defects are generated at the interface between the semiconductor and the gate insulator, and degradation is induced. By this photo emission analysis, the hot carrier was confirmed, and it became clear that the degradation by pulse stress was caused by the hot carrier.

We concluded that the degradation during pulse application is due to hot carriers.\n\n## 4. Conclusion\n\nIn this study, we were able to clarify the existence of hot carrier in the analysis of degradation phenomenon of the oxide-TFTs by the emission analysis. We discovered that a unique phenomenon , i.e., hot carrier-induced degradation that is not accompanied by a change in threshold voltage and in which a decrease in on-current is dominant. The degradation is remarkable in the case of highmobility, that is, high-performance. In addition, we concluded that the generation of hot carriers and the accompanying degradation phenomenon become prominent in pulse stress assuming next-generation circuit applications, and countermeasures need to be considered.\n\n## 5.

R.1, Jung‑Hwa Cha1, June‑Seo Kim1, Won SeokYun1, Myoung‑Jae Lee1 & Hyeon‑Jun **Lee1***\nThe oxygen vacancies and hydrogen in oxide semiconductors are regarded as the primary sources of charge carriers and various studies have investigated the efect of hydrogen on the properties of oxide semiconductors. However, the carrier generation mechanism between hydrogen and oxygen vacancies in an a-IGZO semiconductor has not yet been clearly examined. In this study we investigated the efect of hydrogen and the variation mechanisms of electrical properties of a thin flm supplied with hydrogen from the passivation layer. SiOx and SiNx, which are used as passivation or gate insulator layers in the semiconductor process, respectively, were placed on the top or bottom of an a-IGZO semiconductor to determine the amount of hydrogen penetrating the a-IGZO active layer. The hydrogen difusion depth was sufciently deep to afect the entire thin semiconductor layer. A \nlarge amount of hydrogen in SiNx directly afects the electrical resistivity of a-IGZO semiconductor, whereas in SiOx, it induces a diferent behavior from that in SiNx, such as inducing an oxygen reaction and O–H bond behavior change at the interface of an a-IGZO semiconductor. Moreover, the change in electrical resistivity owing to the contribution of free electrons could be varied based on the bonding method of hydrogen and oxygen. Metal oxide semiconductor thin-flm transistor (TFTs), especially indium-gallium-zinc-oxide based ones, have received considerable interest since Hosono group reported the frst amorphous IGZO (a-IGZO) based TFT in 20041. Te a-IGZO based TFTs have been extensively studied due to their excellent performance attributes such as a high feld-efect mobility, good electrical uniformity, large-area stability, and its endurance2–6. Out of the candidate materials available for oxide-based TFTs, a-IGZO is considered as the most suitable switching layer for application in advanced display backplanes7,8. Unlike other covalent bond-based semiconductors, such as Si-based semiconductors, oxide semiconductors have an ionic bonding structure with unique electrical properties, which is primarily caused by the changes in the oxygen vacancies in their structure9,10. Because oxygen vacancies and hydrogen in oxide semiconductors are regarded as the primary sources of charge carriers, hydrogen treatments efectively control the electrical performance of a-IGZO thin flms11, and various studies have investigated the efect of hydrogen on the properties of oxide semiconductors12–14. Oxygen vacancies can be controlled through various methods, such as controlling the processing conditions (i.e., gas partial pressure15, input power16, and temperatures during deposition17), altering the material composition, and administering post-treatment (i.e., thermal annealing18, high pressure19, and hydrogen plasma20). Owing to the high electronegativity of oxygen in the ionic bonding of oxide semiconductors, hydrogen incorporation in oxide semiconductors is unavoidable21. \n\nHydrogen in an oxide semiconductor acts as a shallow donor by ionizing and bonding with oxygen to form O–H bonds22–24. Te hydrogen in the active layer can originate from the ambient atmosphere (a large amount of hydrogen is present in air), which results in unintentional n-doping. In addition, hydrogen can easily penetrate into the active layer by the formation of the gate insulator, the deposition of the passivation layer, and the heat treatment process. However, the carrier generation mechanism between hydrogen and oxygen vacancies in an a-IGZO thin flms has not yet been clearly examined, and further investigation is necessary.\n\nIn this paper, we report the role of hydrogen in a-IGZO semiconductors, which can afect their electrical properties.

The changes observed in the electrical properties of the semiconductor were verified to be closely related to the amount of hydrogen present in the two insulators. The correlation between the hydrogen content inside the a -IGZO semiconductor and the binding state of the surrounding elements was also discussed.\n\n## Methods\n\nSchematics of the cross-sectional views of a -IGZO films covered with SiO 2 or SiN 2 are shown in Fig. 1 ; the films were prepared under the same deposition conditions and using the same fabrication process used for the a -IGZO active layer. A 100 nm thick a -IGZO active layer was deposited by sputtering a ceramic target with InO x :GaO x :ZnO x at a molar ratio of 1:1:1.5 at room temperature on a silicon thermal oxidation/Si substrate. To measure the electrical properties, a resistor pattern was formed in the a -IGZO active layer via photolithography.\n\nNotably, in this study, the SiN x and SiO x layers were used as hydrogen diffusion source layers. Typically, SiN x contains a large amount of hydrogen. In contrast, SiO x contains a relatively low amount of hydrogen. Both SiN x and SiO x were used as insulator or passivation layers in the conventional device. SiO x and SiN x films of 50 nm thickness were deposited via plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) at 350 °C. The source gas flow, pressure, and radio frequency power were SiH s/ NH 3 = 15/30 sccm, 1 torr, and 150 W for SiN s, respectively, and SiH 4 /N 2 O = 30/2000 sccm, 1 torr, and 100 W for SiO 2 , respectively. Six different thin-film structures were prepared to evaluate the effect of hydrogen according to the position of the hydrogen source: conventional a -IGZO (Fig. 1 a), SiN x /a -IGZO (Fig. 1 b), SiO x /a -IGZO (Fig. 1 c), a -IGZO/SiN x (Fig. 1 d), SiN x /a -IGZO/SiN x\n(Fig. 1 e), and SiO 2 / a -IGZO/SiN 2 (Fig. 1 f). To minimize the influence of the contact resistance, the gold via contact electrodes of 100 nm thickness were formed by sputtering. After the fabrication process, the fabricated stacks\n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)\n\nFigure 2. Electrical properties of as-grown and annealed a-IGZO flms with diferent structures of passivation or gate insulator layers. were annealed at 350 °C for 1 h in air. A Keithley 2636 B dual-source meter was used to measure the electrical properties of the a-IGZO thin flms with width/length of 50 um /100 um. Time-of-fight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF–SIMS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to measure and analyze the amount of hydrogen in the flms and chemical composition depth profles of the flms, respectively. Te channel length and critical dimension of the fabricated device were measured using TRM 200 (thermal refective microscope, Nanoscope systems).\n\n## Results And Discussion\n\nElectrical measurements at the two terminals were performed using a semiconductor probing system. Te electrical resistivity measured between the source and drain without a gate electrode is shown in a bar chart (Fig. 2) for the as-grown and annealed a-IGZO flms, respectively. Te resistivity of the as-grown a-IGZO flm was approximately 10 Ω∙cm, and the resistivity was confrmed to increase by two orders of magnitude afer the annealing process. Te resistivity of the a-IGZO flm covered with SiNx was lower by approximately three orders of magnitude compared to that of the conventional a-IGZO flm without any layers, and this electrical property remained unchanged even afer the annealing process (Fig. 2 (SiNx/a-IGZO)). In contrast, the as-grown sample covered with SiOx showed low resistivity, which increased similar to the resistivity of the conventional a-IGZO afer the annealing process (Fig. 2 (SiOx/a-IGZO)).\n\nVery low resistivity was observed only in the sample wherein a SiNx layer formed on the a-IGZO flm, and it was maintained regardless of the annealing. Te sample wherein the conventional a-IGZO flm and SiOx were deposited on top showed a relatively high resistivity, unlike the sample wherein the SiNx layer was deposited. Additionally, the resistivity tended to increase afer annealing. When the SiNx layer was deposited below the a-IGZO flm instead of above it, the resistivity of the a-IGZO flm was similar to that of the conventional a-IGZO \nflm, regardless of the annealing process (Fig. 2 (a-IGZO/SiNx), (SiNx/a-IGZO/SiNx), and (SiOx/a-IGZO/SiNx)). Tus, the SiNx layer deposition under the a-IGZO flm did not signifcantly afect its resistivity, regardless of the annealing process. Te SiOx/IGZO layer formed on the SiNx showed a relatively low resistance compared to the SiOx/IGZO formed on the thermal SiOx, but a higher resistance was still observed compared to the sample formed on the SiNx. Resistivity was strongly afected during the formation of SiNx or SiOx layer on the a-IGZO \nflm. According to previous studies25, the injection of hydrogen as a shallow donor induces an increase in electrical conductivity and enables hydrogen to difuse deeper into the bulk a-IGZO flm through the annealing process26. Terefore, demonstrating the relationship between the amount of hydrogen and the annealing process and determining the mechanism behind the resistivity variation is necessary.\n\nFigure 2 shows that the electrical properties of the a-IGZO flms change sensitively based on the material deposited on top of the a-IGZO layer. To confrm the efect of hydrogen or oxygen, material analysis was performed only on the structure wherein the material was deposited on the upper part of the a-IGZO flm, where the electrical properties were sensitive. Because a hydrogen atom is exceptionally small, identifying the exact location or content of hydrogen is not easy. In this study, the hydrogen concentration in the interior and interface of the layer was measured via SIMS, which can efciently analyze small atoms. Figure 3 shows the SIMS depth profle analyses for hydrogen (H), hydroxyl oxygen (O–H), and indium (indium was monitored for determining the boundaries of a-IGZO flms). Te as-grown a-IGZO flm quantitatively contained~ 1019 cm−3 of hydrogen and a slightly inclined shape was observed at the interface with the SiO2/Si substrate, as shown in Fig. 3a. Te amount of hydrogen and O–H decreased slightly afer the annealing process, and the inclined shape became \n\n![3_image_0.png](3_image_0.png)\n\n![3_image_1.png](3_image_1.png)\n\nflat because the structure of the atoms in the a -IGZO film deposited via sputtering was stabilized through the annealing process. In Fig. 3b, it can be observed that the measured hydrogen and O–H concentrations in the a -IGZO film covered with SiN x were one order of magnitude greater than that in the conventional a -IGZO film.\n\nThe increase in the amount of hydrogen inside the a -IGZO film can be attributed to two reasons. The first is that hydrogen permeates from the a -IGZO layer surface owing to the hydrogen plasma generated in the SiN x layer during the PECVD process by which the number of hydrogen atoms increases. The second is that the large amount of hydrogen contained in SiN, migrates into the a -IGZO layer after the formation of the SiN, layer.\n\nTh e observed low resistivity was due to the infused hydrogen functioning as a shallow donor, and the vacancies generated by the plasma 27 . After the annealing process, the amounts of both hydrogen and O–H were reduced; however, a significant amount of hydrogen and O–H were present in the a -IGZO film, which was higher than that in the conventional a -IGZO film. Because a large amount of hydrogen was physically injected by the plasma, the measured hydrogen content on the surface of the as-grown a -IGZO film covered with SiN x was ~ 10 20 cm −3 , which was one order of magnitude higher than that in the conventional a -IGZO film. The injected hydrogen diffused deeper during annealing, as shown in the inset of Fig. 3b. The hydrogen and O–H profiles reduced exponentially with depth. After the annealing process, the amount of hydrogen was approximately half an order lower than that in the near-surface region, and the diffusion depth was increased. The diffusion coefficient was obtained using the least-squares fit of the hydrogen SIMS depth profile to a complementary error function as follows:\n\n## Cd(X,Y) = Coerfc 2 / D T D\n\n(1)\nwhere, C 0 denotes the amount of hydrogen on the surface, D is the diffusion coefficient, t D denotes the annealing time, and x denotes the diffusion depth of hydrogen 28 . Hydrogen diffusion depths of 19.52 nm and 22.71 nm were obtained for the as-grown and annealed a -IGZO sample covered with SiN a , respectively. As shown in Fig. 2 , the electrical properties of the a -IGZO sample covered with SiN x had very low resistance regardless of the annealing process. SiN x may cause a critical hydrogen n -doping phenomenon in a transistor using a -IGZO as the active layer because of its high hydrogen concentration and hydrogen diffusion depth of 20 nm or more.\n\nIn contrast, the as-grown a -IGZO film covered with SiO x contained a slightly lower amount of hydrogen than the a -IGZO film covered with SiN x . The hydrogen in the SiO x could not move or be injected smoothly into the a-IGZO film, as shown in Fig. 3c. The concentrations of indium, hydrogen, and O-H increased rapidly at the\n\n![4_image_2.png](4_image_2.png)\n\n![4_image_3.png](4_image_3.png)\n\n(a)\n\n| Metal-Oxygen    |                |     |     |     |\n|-----------------|----------------|-----|-----|-----|\n| (f)             | Oxygen Vacancy |     |     |     |\n| Hydroxyl Oxygen |                |     |     |     |\n| Anneal_O1s      | 65.97%         |     |     |     |\n| 18.87%          | 15.16%         |     |     |     |\n| 52              | 525            | 530 | 532 | 534 |\n\n52\n\n![4_image_0.png](4_image_0.png)\n\n![4_image_1.png](4_image_1.png)\n\nBinding Energy (eV)\nFigure 4.

This imbalance is presumably caused by the unstable distribution of atoms and the increase in the element densities at the interface, and disappeared by annealing. Notably, changes were observed in the hydrogen and O–H concentrations after annealing. The amount of hydrogen was changed negligibly, whereas the amount of O–H increased in the a -IGZO film covered with SiO 2 .\n\nIndium-out diffusion (dished open circle in Fig. 3 c) was unusually observed at the interface between the SiO x and a -IGZO layers, which is presumably related to the increase in the O–H concentration. This phenomenon was not observed in the a -IGZO film covered with SiN x . To confirm this phenomenon, XPS measurements were performed for the oxidation state of indium (In3d 5/2 ), as shown in Fig. 3 d. Generally, indium exists in the form of InO 3 in an a -IGZO host matrix. In Fig. 3d, indium in the as-grown state or before the annealing process forms a stable state by combining with oxygen. The InO 3 peak at the binding energy of 444.6 eV shifts to a In(OH) 3 peak at the binding energy of 445.2 eV through annealing. This is the indium surface oxidation phenomenon of a -IGZO films caused by N 2 O plasma, which is a precursor of the SiO 2 layer used during the SiO 2 PECVD process.\n\nAs SiO 2 is generated on the a -IGZO film, In(OH) 3 is presumably formed owing to the continuous oxidation of indium at the interface and bonding with the hydrogen in SiO 2 . SIMS measurements confirmed that In(OH) 3 out-diffused into SiO 2 . As the bonding states of indium, hydrogen, and oxygen changed, the resistivity of the a -IGZO film covered with SiO x increased.\n\nThe change in the bonding state according to the oxygen-based SiO x material and the oxygen-free SiN x material formed on the a -IGZO could have an extremely sensitive effect on the electrical characteristics of the tens of nanometers of the oxide semiconductor. To confirm the specific binding state, the interfacial effect of thermal energy injection on the three different device structures was studied through XPS measurements. Figure 4 shows the XPS deconvolutions of the O1s intensities in the a -IGZO films. The three peaks are attributed to the metal–oxygen (M–O) bonds at 530 eV, oxygen vacancies (V o ) at 531 eV, and hydroxyl (O–H) bonds at 532 eV 19 .\n\nFigure 4 a,b,c show the XPS signals of three different a -IGZO device structures (as-grown state).

The deposition of additional material on top of the a -IGZO layer changes the a-IGZO interface state. The signal at 530 eV, indicating the M–O state, tends to reduce gradually as SiN 2 or SiO 2 is deposited on the a -IGZO layer, resulting in a relative increase in the oxygen defect states or hydroxyl groups. It could be physically the oxygen vacancy generation via the plasma bombardment of the precursor gases during the PECVD deposition of SiN x or SiO x stacks. These vacancies generate free electrons in the a -IGZO layer 29 ,\nresulting in low resistivity. The reduction in oxygen vacancies and O–H bonds by reducing the damage caused by the plasma bombardment during annealing was observed, as shown in Fig. 4. Figures 4d,e,f show the deconvoluted O1s peaks of the annealed structures, wherein an elevated O–H bond concentration can be observed.\n\nThe concentration of O–H bonds in Fig. 4 f increased from 11.55% to 15.16%, similar to that observed in the SIMS measurement data (Fig. 3 c). Oxygen vacancies and O–H bonds, which are normally considered defects in the host matrix, were reduced by supplying thermal energy. In the case of the a -IGZO film covered with SiO x ,\n\n![5_image_0.png](5_image_0.png)\n\n![5_image_1.png](5_image_1.png)\n\nFigure 5. Schematics of (a) shallow donor generation in conventional a-IGZO flm, (b) passivation of defects by hydrogen in conventional a-IGZO flm. Formation of hydrogen, oxygen, and indium-related states (c)–(f) in a-IGZO flms covered with SiNx, and (g)–(h) in a-IGZO flms covered with SiOx.\n\nthe O–H bonds increased when thermal energy was supplied. Te following section discusses the correlation between the change in the host matrix and electrical resistance caused by the movement of hydrogen atoms.\n\nIn conventional a-IGZO flms, hydrogen can be found in the H0, H+, and H− states. Te existence of these three diferent states of hydrogen in an a-IGZO flm depends on the host matrix state and surrounding environment of the hydrogen atom. Interestingly, hydrogen atoms replace oxygen vacancies in oxide-based materials, acting like oxygen; these atoms can then combine with metals25. Tis phenomenon mainly occurs when the hydrogen in the H− state either makes the defect states generated by oxygen vacancies disappear or moves below the Fermi level to deactivate the defect state30, resulting in the formation of thermally stable metal–hydrogen bonds (M–H), as shown in Fig. 5a. In contrast, hydrogen in the H+ state reacts with O2− and donates an electron via the following reaction shown in Fig. 5b:\nH (2) + + O2− → OH− + e−\nWhen an a-IGZO flm contains hydrogen at [H]≫ 1020 cm−3, most of the hydrogen atoms form O–H bonds rather than H2 or H0 molecules31. Ionized H+ acts as a shallow donor by releasing free electrons through bonding with oxygen, as shown in Eq. (2). In the case of SiNx deposited on top of the a-IGZO flm, the supply of large quantities of hydrogen from SiNx rapidly increases the hydrogen content in the a-IGZO flm and changes the environment such that hydrogen and oxygen can be easily combined, as shown in Fig. 5c. One of the origins of the free electrons is the increasing number of shallow donors by the plasma treatment of SiH4 and NH3 gas, which are SiNx precursor gases. Another reason is the bombardment damage to the upper surface of a-IGZO \ngenerated during the plasma process (Fig. 5d). Te bombardment damage causes oxygen to escape or change its location, thereby inducing oxygen vacancies. Terefore, the as-grown a-IGZO flm covered with SiNx exhibited a low resistivity and high oxygen vacancy concentration. During annealing at 350 °C, the weak O–H bonds are easily deformed and migrated by the thermal energy, thereby decreasing the O–H concentration, as confrmed by the SIMS and XPS results. However, the a-IGZO covered with SiNx still contained a large amount of hydrogen because a large amount of hydrogen was already infused into the a-IGZO flm through the PECVD process, and thermal energy did not afect the hydrogen combined with the metal (H−), as shown in Fig. 5e,f. Tis causes a low resistivity in the a-IGZO flm covered with SiNx afer annealing.\n\nIn contrast, Fig. 5g shows that InOx in the a-IGZO flm readily reacts at the interface between SiOx and a-IGZO flm with the oxygen precursor (N2O gas) injected during SiOx deposition. Tis reaction generates InO3 by combining InO2 with the excess oxygen supplied by the capture of surrounding free electrons31. As confrmed from the SIMS measurements, the indium peak difused outward from the a-IGZO layer to the SiOx layer, and the hydrogen and O–H peaks rapidly increased at the interface between SiOx and a-IGZO. When thermal energy is supplied to the a-IGZO flm covered with SiOx, InO3 captures the surrounding free electrons and combines with ionized hydrogen to form In(OH)3 32, as shown in Fig. 5h:\nInOx + H (3) + + e− → In(OH)x Additionally, ionized hydrogen (H−) moves to the vacancy site by supplying thermal energy, which results in vacancy passivation and decreases the number of free electrons. Tis reaction can be confrmed from the XPS spectra of In3d shown in Fig. 3d and the SIMS results shown in Fig. 3c, wherein the O–H concentration can be observed to increase. Based on the aforementioned processes, the resistivity of the sample covered with SiOx increased.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe studied the correlation between the hydrogen behavior and electrical properties of oxide semiconductor devices. Te test samples were fabricated with six diferent types of structures, and the electrical properties of the a-IGZO flms were observed to change sensitively depending on the material formed on the upper part of the oxide semiconductor. Te dynamic increase and decrease in the electrical resistivity of an a-IGZO semiconductor is confrmed to be closely correlated with the amount of hydrogen present in the two insulators used as the passivation and gate insulator layers in the semiconductor process. In the case of the SiNx layer, a high hydrogen content (8× 1019 cm−3) was confrmed, and the hydrogen concentration at the interface was extremely high because of the hydrogen injected into the a-IGZO layer during the SiNx PECVD process. Moreover, a hydrogen difusion length of 22 nm or more was confrmed to have formed through the annealing process. In contrast, In(OH)3 was formed at the interface and out-difused to SiOx in the a-IGZO layer, and the concentration (3× 1020 cm−3) of O–H was signifcantly higher than that of hydrogen afer annealing.\n\nHydrogen is always present in oxide semiconductors and is afected by various factors, such as the state of bonding with metal or oxygen and the vacancies of oxygen. To use oxide semiconductors for various applications, understanding the hydrogen behavior is essential, and additional research is required on methods to control the hydrogen content and functions in oxide semiconductors such that it can function as desired.\n\n## Data Availability\n\nTe datasets generated during and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.\n\nReceived: 16 September 2022; Accepted: 11 November 2022\n\n## References\n\n1.

In recent years, compared with amorphous silicon and organic semiconductor TFTs, amorphous indium–gallium–zinc oxide thin-film transistors (a-IGZO TFTs) have attracted more attention as one of promising candidates for active matrix flat-panel display due to their larger field effect mobility [6,7].\n\nTo improve the performance of TAOS TFTs, most studies focused on adjusting process variables such as gas partial pressure, chemical components of target, and different plasma treatment [8–11].\n\nSome of the present researches have studied the effect of hydrogen on the properties of transparent oxide semiconductor (TOS) and transparent conducting oxide (TCO) [12–14]. Carrier concentration, resistivity, and instability (over the environment change) of TOS and TCO films were found to be improved by properly introducing hydrogen. However, the effect of hydrogen on the amelioration of threshold voltage and subthreshold swing of a-IGZO TFTs has not been reported yet. It is useful to investigate the improvement of electrical characteristics of a-IGZO TFTs with a simple method relying just on the modulation of gas ratio of H2 during the active layer fabrication process.\n\nIn this work, we studied the characteristics of a-IGZO TFTs by introducing hydrogen into active layer. It was found that the introduction of hydrogen dramatically improved the a-IGZO TFT device performance. Moreover, the crystal structure and chemical composition of a-IGZO films were also examined to analyze the influence of hydrogen.\n\n## 2. Experiment\n\nInverted coplanar a-IGZO TFTs were fabricated on a glass substrate (Corning \\#2000, 10 - 10 mm2 area). The process temperature was fixed at room temperature. The details of the device fabrication process are as follows. A 300 nm-thick layer of MoW\nwas sputtered and patterned as the gate electrode on glass substrate. Then, a 300 nm-thick silicon-oxide (SiO2) layer served as gate dielectric was deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). After the SiO2 layer deposition, a 100 nm-thick ITO layer was sputtered and patterned as the source/drain electrode. Subsequently, a 65 nm-thick a-IGZO active layer was deposited by sputtering an IGZO (In:Ga:Zn:O = 1:1:1:4 at.%) target at a working pressure of 4 mtorr and defined as active region by lithography and etching processes. The hydrogen-incorporated a-IGZO\nactive layers were prepared by varying the Ar/H2 ratio during deposition process. The first group was deposited with 30 sccm\n\n1498 \n\n![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)\n\nAr (denoted as STD); the second group was deposited with a gas mixture of 27 sccm Ar and 3 sccm-H2 (denoted as 3 sccm-H2);\nand the other was deposited with a gas mixture of 20 sccm Ar and 10 sccm-H2 (denoted as 10 sccm-H2).\n\nThe inset in Fig. 1 displays a schematic cross section of a-IGZO\nTFT. The electrical characteristics of TFT devices with fixed dimensions of length (L)=8 lm and width (W) = 24 lm were measured.\n\nBefore the measurements, all the TFT samples were annealed at 150 C for 1 h to exclude the interference of humidity. Furthermore, transfer characteristics (drain current versus gate voltage curve, ID–VG) were measured at drain voltage (VD) = 4 V. In order to eliminate the effect of atmosphere, electrical characteristics were extracted in a vacuum. All electrical measurements were made using an Agilent 4156C semiconductor parameter analyzer. The crystal structure was examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The chemical composition was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).\n\n## 3. Results And Discussion\n\nFig. 1 shows the representative transfer ID–VG characteristics of\n\n![1_image_1.png](1_image_1.png)\n\na-IGZO TFTs fabricated with different H2 flow rate (0, 3, 10 sccm).\n\nClearly, the threshold voltage (Vth) and subthreshold swing (SS) of 3 sccm-H2 TFT are better than those of STD TFT. To compare device performance, electrical parameters were extracted and listed in the insert table. The Vth is defined as ID reaching 109 A at VD = 4 V. The SS is calculated from the reciprocal of the slope of ID = 1011 to 109 A. The field effect mobility (lFE) is obtained from the ID–VG\ncurve in the linear region using the equation for transconductance, gm = (oID/oVG)VD=4V = (Ci lFE W/L)VD, where Ci denotes the gate capacitance. However, the TFT does perfectly lose its gate control ability and become very conductive when H2 flow rate is increased to 10 sccm. This result indicates that the hydrogen acts as a donor in IGZO film and the introduction of hydrogen in IGZO film increases the carrier concentration, which consists with the previous studies\n[11,12]. Since the 10 sccm-H2 TFT has no switching characteristic, this work is focused on the comparison of STD and 3 sccm-H2 TFTs.\n\nIt is well known that the threshold voltage and subthreshold swing of TFTs are related to the interface trap density and the number of deep state [15]. The better subthreshold swing is attributed to the decrement of active layer/dielectric interface trap density and the number of deep state. The initial trapped charge at the active layer/dielectric interface will influence the threshold voltage.\n\nIn addition, a threshold voltage shift is easily observed as numbers of traps exist at the active layer/dielectric interface by forward/reverse voltage sweep [16,17]. Therefore, the hysteresis measurement is usually performed to investigate the influence of traps.\n\nFig. 2 shows the hysteresis in transfer characteristics observed between forward (VG = 20 to 30 V) and reverse (VG = 30 V to 20 V)\ngate voltage sweeps. Clearly, the threshold voltage shift (DVth) is about 4 V for STD TFTs and is about 2 V for H2 TFTs. (The DVth is defined as VrVf, where Vf and Vr are the threshold voltages derived from forward and reverse voltage sweeps.) The hysteresis varies the interface trap occupancy, leading to changes of effective insulator charges [17]. Thus, the DVth increases with the increasing interface trap density. The results imply that the introduction of moderate hydrogen into IGZO active layer effectively reduces the interface trap density and the number of deep state and improves the transfer characteristics of TFTs.\n\nTo confirm whether hydrogen affects the crystallinity of IGZO\nfilm to ameliorate the performance of TFTs, the XRD patterns of STD IGZO film and IGZO + H2 film on a silicon substrate are shown in Fig. 3. The only characteristic peak at 2h = 44.4 deg. is referred to crystalline silicon substrate. The XRD results indicate that IGZO\nfilms have no preferred orientation regardless of depositing ambient, which suggests that both IGZO films are amorphous phase.\n\nConsequently, the introduction of hydrogen does not increase the crystallinity of IGZO films. Besides physical property, the chemical bonding configuration is also an important factor to clarify the effect of hydrogen.\n\n![2_image_1.png](2_image_1.png)\n\n![2_image_2.png](2_image_2.png)\n\n![2_image_3.png](2_image_3.png)\n\nComparing the XPS spectra of In, Ga, Zn and O of STD a-IGZO\nand a-IGZO + H2 films, only the spectra of oxygen have distinguishable variation. As a result, the interaction between H and O seems to have the most direct relationship with the reduction of the interfacial trap density and the number of deep state. Fig. 4 shows the XPS spectra of O 1s core level of the two kinds of samples. As shown in Fig. 4a, the XPS spectrum of STD a-IGZO film can only be deconvolved into two sub-peaks by Gaussian fitting. The two sub-peaks are respectively attributed to O2 ions surrounded by metal atoms (at 529.8 eV) and O2 ions in oxygen deficient regions\n(at 531.0 eV) [18–20]. Compared with the STD a-IGZO film, the a-IGZO + H2 film can be deconvolved into three components. The additional peak is located at 531.6 eV, as shown in Fig. 4b. It has been reported as the O–H bonding [18]. This result indicates that\n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)\n\nH and O reaction certainly plays an important role to improve the characteristics of a-IGZO TFT, and such reaction is not present in STD a-IGZO film (STD TFTs). In addition, the area ratio of O2 ions in oxygen deficient regions decreases apparently and the area ratio of O–H bonds increases in the a-IGZO + H2 film. In this study, the STD IGZO film is amorphous; thus, the film contains considerable quantities of defect sites. As hydrogen was introduced into the a-IGZO film, O2 ions in oxygen deficient regions related to defect sites (deep states) are diminished. It reveals that defect sites (deep states) in a-IGZO + H2 films are passivated by hydrogen. Accordingly, the introduction of hydrogen is effective to reduce the defect sites in the a-IGZO film, giving rise to the decrease of interface trap density (between a-IGZO and dielectric) and the decrease of the number of deep state in a-IGZO + H2 TFTs.\n\n## 4. Conclusion\n\nIn this study, the electrical characteristics of a-IGZO TFTs were investigated by introducing hydrogen into active layer. The Vth and SS of a-IGZO TFTs were improved since hydrogen-induced passivation of the deep state and the interface trap state. The hysteresis in transfer characteristics was examined to confirm that the interface trap states were reduced by hydrogen introduction. In addition, physical property and chemical composition of a-IGZO\nfilms were inspected to analyze the effect of hydrogen. These results may serve as clues on how to improve the properties of aIGZO film as well as a-IGZO TFTs with hydrogen gas.\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nThis work was partially supported by the National Science Council of the Republic of China under Contract Nos.

However, in the present study, a right shift in VTH was observed in the reverse-sweep current−voltage (I−V) curves after applying NBIS to top-gate IGZO TFTs by a UV backlight. The hysteresis window of the forward and reverse sweep I−V curves widened with the increase in the stress time.

In addition, an abnormal gm peak appeared in the forward I−V curve after 2000 s of the backlight NBIS, which was verified by testing the devices with different dimensions. Silvaco TCAD simulation results indicated a strong electric field in the sidewall, confirming the generation of sub-channels. The comparison of the ΔVTH after UV\nbacklight NBIS in three different devices suggested that the higher N2O/SiH4 flow rate and lower power deposition can produce a good quality buffer layer. A rapid examination of a buffer layer is possible using the backlight NBIS. In addition, the presence of H2 in the buffer layer was confirmed by the thermal desorption spectroscopy. Finally, the reliability of the devices can be enhanced by improving the modulation of the existing deposition process. KEYWORDS: negative bias illumination stress (NBIS), optimal buffer layer process, Silvaco TCAD, top-gate IGZO TFTs, thermal desorption spectroscopy *(TDS)*\n- **INTRODUCTION**\nWith the development of advanced technology, the demand for high-quality displays is continuously increasing. Among amorphous metal oxide semiconductor thin-film transistors (TFTs), InGaZnO (a-IGZO) TFTs exhibit wide applicability. In addition to traditional active-matrix liquid-crystal-display applications, active-matrix organic light-emitting diodes, fully transparent displays, and low-temperature polycrystalline oxide applications are gradually being developed.1−6 Because virtualand augmented-reality applications require ultrahigh resolutions and high frame rates to match the capabilities of human vision, the demand for field-effect mobility in TFTs has increased.7−9 Low-temperature polysilicon, organic TFTs, and IGZO TFTs have advantage over conventional a-Si, owing to high mobility (10−70 cm2/V s), low leakage, low-cost processing, and large-area uniformity.10−15 Because IGZO\nTFTs can be deposited at room temperature, their development in the field of wearable devices has been considerably promoted.16,17 Recently, IGZO TFTs have been widely explored for memory-device applications, particularly those\n\n| Received:                   | November 29, 2022   |\n|-----------------------------|---------------------|\n| Accepted:                   | January 15, 2023    |\n| Published: January 24, 2023 |                     |\n\n![0_image_1.png](0_image_1.png)\n\npertaining to one transistor−resistor, owing to their low leakage in the OFF state and room-temperature deposition.18−20 In addition, improving device characteristics based on existing process technologies has been under investigation in the past few years. The primary contribution of this study is revealing that the reliability of devices can be improved by modulating the existing buffer layer deposition process. Buffer layer or gate insulator deposition is paramount because it influences the reliability of IGZO TFTs.21,22 In the conventional process, by adjusting the N2O/SiH4 flow rate and power, the quality of SiO2 layer is modulated, and channel doping and interface passivation is achieved with different hydrogen residues during the deposition process.23−25 Moreover, the electrical instability of the negative bias illumination stress\n(NBIS) in IGZO TFTs has been reported previously.26−29 These studies propose that IGZO TFTs illuminated with ultraviolet light (UV) generate many electron−hole pairs; therefore, under the experimental conditions of NBIS, holes driven by the electric field from the negative bias of the gate get trapped in the gate oxide layer and bulk defects, shifting the threshold voltage to the left, thereby degrading IGZO TFTs.\n\nHowever, in the present work, an abnormal VTH right shift in the reverse sweep and sub-channel generation in forward sweep I−V curves was observed in top-gate IGZO TFTs for the negative bias (Vg = −30 V) under UV (375 nm) backlight illumination. The abnormal VTH shift and hysteresis-window increment were explained on the basis of the energy-band diagram. The impact of hole trapping in IGZO, the gate insulator, and electron trapping in the buffer layer was investigated. In addition, an abnormal transconductance (gm)\npeak was observed in the top-gate IGZO TFT devices, fabricated with different widths and fixed length, after 2000 s of backlight NBIS. Silvaco technology computer-aided design (TCAD) electrical simulation results also confirmed the hole trapping in the side wall region, which lead to the generation of sub-channels, causing the early turn on in the I−V curves and the degradation of gm.\n\nFurther, the amount of H2, OH, and H2O composition in different process conditions of the buffer layer deposition were confirmed by thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS). The comparison of the degradation trends of I−V curves and TDS\nresults revealed that the low power of buffer layer 2 (BL-2)\nsignificantly influences the amount of H2, OH, and H2O\nconcentration, which truly compensates the effect of NBIS reverse-sweep-induced electron capture phenomenon.\n\n- RESULTS AND **DISCUSSION**\nIn this study, the dimensions of the devices were 10 μm × 10 μm (L × W). Figure 1a shows the schematics of the top-gate IGZO TFTs. Figure 1b illustrates the different buffer layer deposition conditions. As shown in Figure 2a, from the electrical characteristics of the forward and reverse sweeps, no window was observed initially; thus, it can be confirmed that the VTH is not influenced by any interfacial defect. After applying backlight NBIS under UV with 600 lux intensity, different trends in VTH of forward and reverse sweeps were observed. As the stress time increased, the degradation window also increased. The solid and hollow lines, in Figure 2b, represent the forward and reverse sweep I−V curves, respectively. As shown in Figure 2c, VTH of the forward sweep first shifted in the negative direction and then in the positive direction. However, VTH of the reverse sweep\n\nACS Applied Electronic Materials **pubs.acs.org/acsaelm** Article\n\n![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)\n\n![1_image_1.png](1_image_1.png)\n\ncontinued to shift in the positive direction. As shown in Figure 2d, the degradation window gradually increased with the stress time.\n\nFigure 3a shows the OFF-state energy band of the device under backlight NBIS operation. In brief, UV illumination generates numerous electron−hole pairs. Holes are injected into the gate insulating layer and IGZO bulk defects by electric-field-assisted thermionic emission, resulting in the left shift of VTH. Figure 3b displays the ON-state band diagram of the device in the dark state. Under backlight NBIS, hole trapping occurs in the gate insulator and bulk defects; thus, when the device is ON, electrons in the channel recombine with the trapped holes. Therefore, VTH during the forward sweep under backlight NBIS is more negative than that of the reverse sweep.\n\nDuring the reverse sweep, VTH shifted less to the left owing to the recombination of the holes in the bulk defects with electrons in the ON-state. Figure 3c represents the schematic of backlight NBIS. The devices were exposed to UV light from the bottom. Figure 3d displays the energy-band diagram of the device (AA' in Figure 3c). The backlight NBIS generates electron−hole pairs in IGZO, and application of the electric field (−30 V) to the top gate injects holes into the top-gate insulator, SiO2, and electrons into the buffer layer, SiO2. Owing\n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)\n\nto the large number of defects, many electrons can enter into the buffer layer. The hole injection into the top-gate insulator and electron injection into the buffer layer result in a V TH shift.\n\nH However, in the present experiment, the V TH shift results from the poor quality of the buffer layer, which leads to more electron injection, shifting V TH to the right. Furthermore, the forward I - V curve of the W10L10 device exhibited an additional g m peak after 2000 s of backlight NBIS, as shown in Figure 4a.\n\n![2_image_2.png](2_image_2.png)\n\nTo validate the deterioration due to the sub-channel formation, the devices with different widths and a fixed length (10 µ m) were tested while keeping the voltage of the g m peak constant in the forward I − V sweeps. The results indicated that the generation of the g m peak was indeed a result of edge effects, 30 as shown in Figure 4b. In the Silvaco electric field simulation, a strong electric field was observed at the edge of the IGZO channel ( Figure 4c ). Owing to the presence of pubs.acs.org/acsaelm Article interfacial defects at the edge during fabrication, holes were injected into the sub-channel under a strong electric field, whereas electron— hole pairs were generated by UV illumination, which led to the early turn ON in the sub-channel, as shown in Figure 4d.\n\nFurther, the devices with different buffer layer processes and fixed top-gate insulators were compared. In this study, the manufacturing process for the top-gate insulator was the same for the three devices. Thus, under the backlight NBIS, hole trapping in the gate insulator can be considered the same for all devices. Therefore, by fixing the amount of hole trapping in the top-gate insulator, the amount of the V TH left shift caused by hole trapping can be fixed. By modulating the deposition process of the buffer layer, a more complete chemical reaction can be executed, and a buffer layer of a superior quality can be obtained. 31 , 3 Under the backlight NBIS, the amount of electron trapping in the buffer layer differs. A good quality buffer layer can reduce the electron trapping, resulting in less V TH right shift.\n\nThe total V TH shift is a result of hole and electron trapping. In this work, the V TH is attributed to the electron trapping in the buffer layer that results in the right shift and degradation of the ON current in the reverse sweep I - V curves. Therefore, by comparing the total V TH shift, a better-quality buffer layer can be realized, and the optimal process conditions can be determined. Figure 5a,b shows the comparison of the V TH\n\n![2_image_1.png](2_image_1.png)\n\nvalues of the reverse sweep I - V curve, which indicates that the smaller the V TH value, the less is the electron trapping in the buffer layer. Therefore, the process with a lower power and a higher N 2 O/SiH 4 flow rate is conducive to a better buffer quality, further improving the reliability of devices.\n\nTo investigate the buffer layer quality, the single film material was analyzed using TDS. IGZO is known to have high density defects in sub-gap. Ide et al. 33 , 34 indicate that these defects are originated by weakly bonded oxygen, hydrogen, and OH-related species. The weakly bonded oxygen captures electron, showing acceptor-like behavior. The carrier concentration system involving hydrogen of donor and weakly bonded oxygen of acceptor behavior compensate each other, balancing the overall charge level, which influences the device electrical characteristic. Figure 6 shows the m/z = 2 for H 2 , m/\nz = 17 for OH, and the m/z = 18 for H 2 O analysis conducted to investigate the impact of these species on the back channel of the IGZO layer. The results indicated that the low power of BL-2 significantly influenced the amount of H 2 , OH, and H 2 O concentration, which was similar to the trend of reverse sweep VTH shift of devices \\#1, \\#2, and \\#3. TDS quantitative analysis was performed by testing the standard specimen of H 2 to obtain the conversion coefficient, and the molecular weight was then obtained as (the total intensity value) × (H 2 conversion coefficient) × (component mass/H 2 mass) from\n\n![3_image_0.png](3_image_0.png)\n\nthe temperature range measured by each test piece. The size of all test pieces was 1 cm × 1 cm. The quantitative values of H2 desorption calculated in the temperature range from 0 to 550\n°C for specimens 1, 2, and 3 were 1.36 × 1014, 6.7 × 1014, and 6.3 × 1014 molec./cm2, respectively, and H2O desorption values were 3.12 × 1015, 6.0 × 1015, and 4.9 × 1015 molec./cm2, respectively. The degradation trends of the I−V curves match the quantitative value of H2 and H2O, indicating that hydrogen acts as the donor and compensates the effect of NBIS reversesweep-induced electron capture phenomenon.\n\n- **CONCLUSIONS**\nIn this study, backlight NBIS was applied to a top-gate IGZO TFT by irradiation of a UV source, which generated a large number of electron−hole pairs. Abnormal VTH right shifts were observed. Owing to the electric field of the gate, holes were attracted to the top-gate insulating layer and electrons were driven to the buffer layer. The electron trapping in the buffer layers differed because of difference in the layer qualities, which resulted in different VTH shifts and degradation windows. The quality of the buffer layer can be analyzed by comparing ΔVTH reverse sweep I−V curves in the initial condition and after backlight NBIS. Hence, backlight NBIS can be used for the rapid examination of the deposited buffer layer.\n\nThe degradation trends of I−V curves conformed to the quantitative value of H2, indicating that hydrogen plays the donor and compensates the effect of the NBIS reverse-sweepinduced electron capture phenomenon. Furthermore, the reliability of the devices can be improved by modulation of the buffer layer deposition process. The higher N2O/SiH4 flow rate and lower power deposition were found to be the optimal buffer layer process conditions. A better design of the buffer layer can further benefit InGaZnO TFT applications, thereby enhancing the stability and facilitating the development of advanced displays.\n\n- EXPERIMENTAL **SECTION**\nDevice Fabrication **Process.** The IGZO TFTs used in this study were prepared with a top-gate structure. First, a buffer layer comprising two SiO2 layers [buffer layer 1 (BL-1) 130 nm and buffer layer 2 (BL-2) 20 nm] was deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) with different deposition powers and N2O/SiH4 flow rate ratios. BL-1 was deposited with N2O/SiH4 flow rate ratio = 30 and power 2 kW. BL-2 was deposited with N2O/SiH4 flow rate ratios = 30 or 50 and power 1.5 or 2 kW. Through the modulation of BL-2, the quality of the buffer layer can be optimized. Next, 25 nm amorphous IGZO active layers were deposited by sputtering, followed by 340 °C post annealing. Subsequently, a 150 nm SiO2 layer was deposited as a gate insulator by PECVD.\n\nEventually, a Ti/Al/Ti stack film was deposited as the gate metal using sputtering. The n+ region was formed in situ by hydrogen plasma doping prior to the deposition of SiONx (300 nm) interlayer dielectric layer by PECVD. Thereafter, contact holes were formed by dry etching. The S/D electrode of the Ti/Al/Ti layer was deposited and patterned. Finally, a 200 nm SiO2 passivation layer was deposited by PECVD. Figure 1a shows the schematics of the top-gate IGZO TFTs. Figure 1b illustrates different buffer layer deposition conditions.\n\nMaterial **Analysis.** TDS (ESCO WA1000) was performed to evaluate the out-gas species from thin-films.\n\nElectrical **Measurements.** All electrical measurements were conducted using an Agilent B1500A semiconductor device analyzer and Cascade Microtech probe stations in the same ambient atmospheric environment.\n\nIGZO Parameters for Silvaco **TCAD.** The density of state parameters for IGZO are listed in Table 1.\n\n| density of states (DOS) in IGZO          |     |             |\n|------------------------------------------|-----|-------------|\n| density of donor-like tail states        | NTD | 1.55 × 1020 |\n| density of acceptor-like tail states     | NTA | 4.0 × 1019  |\n| density of donor-like Gaussian states    | NGD | 6 × 1016    |\n| density of acceptor-like Gaussian states | NGA | 3 × 1017    |\n| slope of donor-like tail states          | WTD | 0.2         |\n| slope of acceptor-like tail states       | WTA | 0.015       |\n| width of donor-like Gaussian states      | WGD | 0.3         |\n| width of acceptor-like Gaussian states   | WGA | 0.15        |\n\n- AUTHOR **INFORMATION**\n\n## Corresponding **Author**\n\nTing-Chang **Chang** − Department of Physics, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung 804, *Taiwan;* orcid.org/\n0000-0002-5301-6693; Email: tcchang3708@gmail.com\n\n## Authors\n\nKuan-Ju **Zhou** − Department of Physics, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung 804, *Taiwan* Mao-Chou Tai − Department of Photonics, National Sun YatSen University, Kaohsiung 804, *Taiwan* Yu-An **Chen** − Department of Physics, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung 804, *Taiwan* Ya-Ting **Chien** − Department of Materials and Optoelectronic Science, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung *804,* Taiwan Pei-Jun Sun − Department of Materials and Optoelectronic Science, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung *804,* Taiwan Po-Yu Yen − Department of Physics, National Sun *Yat-Sen* University, Kaohsiung 804, *Taiwan* Simon M.

Specifically, the role of ZnO as epitaxial initiator layer for the growth mechanism is clarified. High-temperature annealing of bilayer films consisting of an amorphous InGaO 3 (ZnO) 5 layer deposited at room temperature and an epitaxial ZnO layer on yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) substrate allows for the growth of single-crystalline film with controlled chemical composition. The epitaxial ZnO thin layer plays an essential role in determining the crystallographic orientation, while the ratio of the thickness of both layers controls the film composition.\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nComplex oxides with a multi-layered structure may exhibit exceptional properties originating from the spatial confinement of conductive electrons in the two-dimensional layer, which is similar to that in a multi-quantum-well. Thus, such a structure may be regarded as a so-called \"natural superlattice\". High- T c superconducting (HTS) oxides with a layered perovskite structure including La 2 -x Ba x CuO 4 , [1] YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 , [2] and Bi 2 Sr 2 Ca-\nCu 2 O 8 , [3] are well-examined systems where the strong correlation among the confined electrons in the layer is responsible for the appearance of the superconducting state.\n\nThe homologous series of LnMO 3 (ZnO) m (Ln = In or Lu, M = Al, Ga, In, or Fe, and m = integer)[ 4 -11 ] is a candidate to exhibit the quantum effect due to its natural superlattice structure. The crystal structure of LnMO 3 (ZnO) m , schematically shown in Figure 1, consists of an alternating stack of a LnO 2 7 layer (Ln 3+ ion located at an octahedral site formed by oxygen) and an MO + (ZnO) nt block (M 3+ and Zn 2+ ions at trigonalbipyramidal and tetrahedral coordination positions, respectively). This makes up the superlattice structure along the [0001]\ndirection. [9-11] A unique feature of this material is that the thickness of the MO + (ZnO) m block can be varied by simply changing the chemical composition, while that of the LnO 2 layer remains unchanged. This may allow for control of electrical and optical properties related to carrier confinement\n[*]\nDr. H. Ohta, Dr. M. Orita, Dr. M.

To clarify whether the spatial confinement of the carrier takes place at all in this series of compounds, the study of single-crystalline films is of great importance.\n\nHowever, conventional vapor phase growth techniques cannot be directly employed for the growth of LnMO 3 (ZnO) m films due to the high temperatures involved. It is generally recognized in the vapor-phase growth process that the two-\n\n![0_image_1.png](0_image_1.png)\n\nFig. 1. Schematic crystal structure of InGaO 3 (ZnO) 5 .

Crystalline Quality\n\nFigure 3 shows atomic force microscopy (AFM) surface images of the ZnO epitaxial film on an YSZ(111) substrate, the bilayer film composed of the InGaO 3 (ZnO) 5 and ZnO epitaxial layers before annealing, and that annealed at 1400 °C in air.\n\nHexagonal spiral grains of ZnO ~ 200 nm in diameter are seen in Figure 3a. High-resolution X-ray diffraction (HR-XRD)\nand reflective high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) patterns reveal that these ZnO grains were hetero-epitaxially grown on the substrate. An almost featureless AFM image seen in Figure 3b, and the halo pattern observed in the HR-\nXRD and RHEED measurements identifies the as-deposited InGaO 3 (ZnO) 5 film as amorphous or containing extremely small crystalline grains. (We describe such state as amorphous in this paper.) On the other hand, atomically flat terraces and step structures are seen after annealing. The terrace width\n\n![2_image_2.png](2_image_2.png)\n\nexceeds ~ 500 nm, which is larger than that of the substrate by several factors, presumably due to the larger step height in the film. This observation, together with HR-XRD and RHEED patterns of the film, demonstrates that the amorphous film is converted into a single-crystalline InGaO 3 (ZnO) 9 film by the thermal treatment.\n\nFigure 4 shows out-of-plane XRD patterns of the annealed films with different ZnO film thickness. The film thickness of the InGaO 3 (ZnO) 5 layer is fixed at 150 nm. That is, the film thickness of ZnO epitaxial layer/amorphous InGaO 3 (ZnO) 5 layer is given as a) 35 nm/150 nm; b) 20 nm/150 nm; c) 2 nm/\n150 nm; and d) 0 nm/150 nm (no ZnO epitaxial layer). Intense Bragg diffraction peaks only from InGaO 3 (ZnO) m (000 l )\nplanes are seen in Figure 4a–c, together with YSZ(111) diffraction, indicating that all films are strongly c -axis-orientated. Further, m -values are obtained as 7, 6, and 5 for the films (a),\n(b), and (c), respectively, which is in good agreement with those predicted from the film thickness ratios. In other words, the m -values may be tuned by the thickness of the ZnO epitaxial layer relative to that of the amorphous InGaO 3 (ZnO) 5 film.\n\nFurther, tuning can be realized using a pair of ZnO and In-\nGaO 3 (ZnO) m targets in the PLD process. The distribution in the tilt angle of the (000/) planes was ~0.1 degrees, as evaluated by an out-of-plane X-ray rocking curve (OXRC) measurement. An in-plane XRD measurement revealed that the epitaxial relationships between the film and the substrate were InGaO 3 (ZnO) 5 (1120) | YSZ(110).\n\nOn the other hand, weak diffraction peaks of (000/) In-\nGaO 3 (ZnO) 5 are seen together with intense YSZ(111) peaks in Figure 4d, and the distribution in the tilt angle of the (000 l )\nome VO : orn jo s opro accessible online coline and 8 * )\t\f\n M@> \n \t \n $ 57)/\"3)$0 $ 57)/\"3)$I\n $ 57)/\"3)$< \f\n \t  \n @\\#C?

Introduction\n\nOxide electronics is a very diverse and active field, encompassing materials such as dielectrics, ferroelectrics, magnetics, piezoelectrics, multiferroics, high-temperature superconductors, epitaxial oxides, memories, and/or sensors. These materials find interest and application in a myriad of devices ranging from high-density memories to large-scale sensor arrays. In this contribution, we focus on a branch of oxide electronics that often employs monikers such as 'oxide thin-film transistors' or 'oxide TFTs'. This topic can be further subcategorized by specifying whether the microstructure of the TFT channel layer is amorphous or polycrystalline. We will confine our attention to a specific class of amorphous channel layer materials, amorphous oxide semiconductors (AOS).\n\nOur AOS TFT topical choice is primarily motivated by flat-panel display considerations. The dominant flat-panel display technology\n- active-matrix liquid crystal display (AMLCD) - would benefit from a higher performance channel layer replacement for amorphous hydrogenated silicon (a-Si:H), as is currently used in switching TFTs for backplane pixels. Such a replacement, however, should not entail a substantial cost penalty. AOS TFTs are very attractive candidates for a-Si:H TFT replacement. The amorphous nature of an AOS TFT is a key advantage. Using the success of a-Si:H TFTs as a guide, amorphous materials are more readily and economically scaled to the exceedingly large dimensions (9 m2) required for AMLCD high-volume manufacturing. As AOS TFTs are successfully integrated into AMLCD backplanes, other flat-panel display applications such as organic light-emitting diodes, electrophoretic displays, and transparent displays may well follow. While AOS TFT\ndevelopment is currently driven by the needs of the flat-panel display industry, other large-area or conventional silicon-based electronics applications could emerge, depending on the performance, reliability, and manufacturability of AOS TFTs as established by their use in commercial displays.\n\nThis paper is organized as follows. Section 2 is devoted to AOS\nmaterials design considerations that motivate the emergence of indium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO) as the current AOS commercial material-of-choice and provide a framework for undertaking future AOS material selection and design. In Section 3, the case for IGZO TFT implementation into next-generation AMLCDs is presented. In Section 4, the more challenging task of employing IGZO\nTFTs into AMOLEDs is addressed. In Section 5, several questions are posed for the AOS research community regarding fundamental scientific/technical issues that, in our view, are not resolved and need to be more adequately addressed. In Section 6, we offer conclusions and perspectives on the future of AOS technology for display and other emerging applications.\n\n54 \n\n## 2. Amorphous Oxide Semiconductor (Aos) Design\n\nThe portion of the periodic table, highlighted in Fig. 1, was proposed by Hosono et al. in 1996 as a starting point for choosing multicomponent combinations of cations for the design of AOS [1].\n\nPrior to initiating a discussion of AOS design, two historical footnotes are warranted. First, these AOS guidelines were originally formulated for the design of transparent conductive oxides (TCOs)\nin contrast to their application as TFT channel materials per the focus of our discussion here. The notion of using these prospective TCO materials in a TFT channel application was in fact quite nonobvious, as witnessed by the nearly one decade delay before the first AOS based TFTs were demonstrated. The desirable traits for a candidate TCO material are substantially different than those for an AOS channel material, given the nature and constraints of their respective applications, and the recognition of the potential for high-performance AOS based TFTs in the early 2000s generated a great deal of excitement in the technical community. Second, in early publications, AOS materials designed according to Fig. 1 guidelines were referred to as amorphous multicomponent heavy-metal cation oxides. Since 'heavy metal' connotes toxicity in conventional English usage, today these materials are referred to as AOS.\n\nReturning to AOS design, Hosono et al. advocated selecting cations from the portion of the periodic table shown in Fig. 1 since materials, designed using such cations, possess conduction bands derived from large ionic-radius, spherically symmetric 4s, 5s, or 6s electron orbitals [1]. These orbitals lead to a high degree of wave-function overlap, electron delocalization, and relatively high electron mobility, independent of whether the microstructure is crystalline or amorphous. Simple binary oxides such as ZnO,\nSnO2, and In2O3 have a strong tendency to crystallize. This can be circumvented by specifying that cations selected from the portion of the periodic table shown in Fig. 1 should be combined in multicomponent systems to confuse the lattice as to which structure type to adopt, thereby frustrating crystallization. The simplicity and viability of these design guidelines has contributed greatly to the success of AOS.\n\nNow consider implications of the elemental color-coding scheme adopted in Fig. 1. Of the fifteen elements proposed in Fig. 1, five of them (As, Cd, Hg, Tl, Pb; red) are avoided by most researchers because of their toxicity, three of them (Cu, Ag, Au; brown) are possibly useful for the design of a p-type semiconductor (since our current emphasis is on n-type AOS design, these elements will be eliminated from further consideration), and three of them (Ge, Ag, Au; orange) are less attractive options because of their high cost. Eliminating these elements from further consideration, six elements remain of the initial fifteen. Four of them (Zn, Ga, In, Sn) are colored blue; they are the elements most commonly used in AOS design. The other two (Sb, Bi; black) may eventually\n\n| 29  Cu  63.54  47   | 48                        |\n|---------------------|---------------------------|\n| Ag 107.87           | Cd  112.40                |\n| 79                  | 80                        |\n| Au 196.97           | Hg  200.59  30  Zn  65.37 |\n\n31 \n\nGa \n\n69.72 \n\n32 \n\nGe \n\n72.59 \n\n33 \n\nAs \n\n74.92 \n\n11 13 12 14 15 \n\n| 31             | 32             | 33     |    |\n|----------------|----------------|--------|----|\n| Ga             | Ge             | As     |    |\n| 69.72          | 72.59          | 74.92  |    |\n| 50  Sn  118.69 |                |        |    |\n| 81             | 82             | 83     |    |\n| Tl             | Pb             | Bi     |    |\n| 204.37         | 207.19         | 208.98 | 4  |\n| 49  In  114.82 | 51  Sb  121.75 | 5  6   |    |\n\nprove to be appropriate AOS cation choices, but their usefulness has apparently not yet been validated in the literature. Further inspection of the detailed color-coding scheme employed in Fig. 1 reveals that cost is also of some concern with respect to Ga and In, while In is sometimes classified as toxic. Since cost is often related to elemental abundance and/or world-wide production, these properties as well as toxicity are compared in Table 1 for the four most common AOS cations. It is very clear from Table 1 that Zn and Sn are the two most attractive AOS cation choices from the perspective of abundance, cost, world-wide production, and toxicity.\n\nBriefly, we now constrain our AOS design discussion to the use of Ga, In, Sn, and/or Zn cations for TFT channel layer applications\n[5–8]. The past decade of intense worldwide research has established a framework whereby the contribution of each of these cations to overall AOS TFT channel performance can be nicely rationalized. In, Sn, and Zn are intriguing AOS design starting points since their binary oxides - In2O3, SnO2, and ZnO - are the three most commonly used TCOs. The small effective masses and corresponding relatively high mobilities of these oxides are valued for both TCO and AOS applications. However, TCO applications require high electron concentrations (-1020–1021 cm3), whereas an optimized AOS for use as a TFT channel layer must have a small electron concentration, preferably <1016 cm3. Incorporation of In and/or Sn (to a lesser extent) in an AOS tend to increase the electron concentration. In contrast, inclusion of Zn and especially of Ga will lead to a suppression of the electron concentration. Unfortunately, use of Ga in an AOS also tends to reduce its mobility.\n\nThe tendency for a given cation in an AOS to increase or suppress the electron carrier concentration can be rationalized by reference to the atomic solid-state energy (SSE) scale given in Fig. 2\n[9,10]. The SSE for a given element constitutes an estimate of its frontier orbital energy position with respect to the vacuum level when it is incorporated into an inorganic solid. Cation and anion behavior are distinguished by the SSE position with respect to 4.5 eV, a universal energy reference corresponding to the hydrogen donor/acceptor ionization energy [e(±)] or, equivalently, to the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) potential of electrochemistry as measured with respect to the vacuum level. Because SSE for a cation equates to the average electron affinity (EA) of a series of binary compounds, it is important to note that the EAs for In2O3, SnO2, and ZnO are reported to fall in the range of 4.4 to 4.6 eV. These values are positioned very near e(±), an energy where electron doping is energetically favorable. For Ga2O3, however, EA = 3.1 eV,\ni.e., it is energetically separated from e(±) by 1.4 eV. At this energy, Ga becomes an electron-suppressing cation. These SSE trends are also consistent with the occasional use of Al and Hf in AOS as electron-suppressing cations [11–13], since SSE (Al) = 3.1 eV and SSE\n(Hf) = 2.0 eV are energetically positioned well above e(±).\n\nIn addition to mobility-enhancing/degrading and electroncreating/suppressing tendencies, two other cation properties may be relevant for future AOS selection/design purposes. First, the wet etching characteristics of an AOS contribute to its process integration compatibility when it is used in a thin film. Ga, In, and especially Zn are easily etched by wet methods, while Sn can present significant challenges. Thus, if an application requires increased selectivity in which the AOS is made harder to etch, the addition of Sn is likely. Second, since Ga and In melt at very low temperatures (30 and 150 C, respectively) compared to Sn and Zn (232 and 420 C, respectively) it is unlikely that Ga- or In-containing metal sputter targets can be fabricated. Thus, sputtering of Ga- or In-containing AOS will require the use of ceramic targets. In contrast, ZTO sputtering can be accomplished via reactive sputtering using a metal target.\n\nBased on these guidelines, AOS designs using Ga, In, Sn, and/or Zn can be comprehensively categorized as follows, recognizing that\n\n| Table 1 Abundance, cost, production volume, and toxicity of the most common amorphous oxide semiconductor cations.

The emphasis here is on TFT channel layer applications in which the electron concentration must be reduced to as low a level as possible. Two-cation designs involving IGO, TGO, or ZGO are expected to have lower electron concentrations compared to ZIO and ZTO since the electron suppressing properties of Ga are known to be superior to those of Zn. The role of Ga is clearly to suppress the electron concentration in IGO, TGO, or ZGO whereas the role of Zn is less clear in ZIO and ZTO since Zn may be a mobility enhancer as well as an electron concentration suppressor. ITO is not expected to be a useful two-cation design channel layer since it lacks an electron suppressing constituent cation. Three-cation designs involving IGZO, IGTO, and TGZO are expected to have lower electron concentrations than ZITO, once again due to the superior electron suppression properties of Ga compared to Zn. Only one three-component AOS - IGZTO - is possible for the design constraints currently under consideration. Of the eleven compositions specified, IGZO with an InGaZnO4 composition is the current consensus champion [14–17], and it is currently being commercialized. Thus, for the remainder of this review, until the conclusions section, our AOS discussion will focus on IGZO.\n\n## 3. Active-Matrix Liquid Crystal Display (Amlcd) Thin-Film Transistor (Tft) Backplane Technology Options\n\nThe architecture of an AMLCD backplane pixel is very simple, consisting of a single voltage-controlled switch. Usually a TFT\nswitch is used to set the optical state of an AMLCD pixel, although this can also be accomplished using single or dual diodes [18].\n\nThree AMLCD TFT technology options - a-Si:H [19], low-temperature polysilicon (LTPS) [20], and IGZO - are compared in Table 2.\n\nFrom the inception of AMLCD technology until today, a-Si:H has been the AMLCD backplane workhorse. a-Si:H is used for AMLCD\napplications since it is has adequate performance, process simplicity, the lowest cost, and can be readily scaled to large-area, metersize dimensions. Three significant a-Si:H advantages highlighted in Table 2 - threshold voltage (VT) uniformity, mobility uniformity, and process complexity - are direct consequences of the amorphous microstructure of a-Si:H. Of the three a-Si:H liabilities listed in Table 2 - poor stability, poor mobility, and NMOS - mobility is the most important consideration in precluding the use of a-Si:H for upcoming AMLCD commercial applications since its mobility is inadequate for the higher anticipated refresh rates required for future products, and limits the ability to reduce TFT size as needed for small pixels in high-resolution mobile displays.\n\nUntil recently, LTPS was universally regarded as the obvious heir-apparent to a-Si:H when its mobility performance was deemed inadequate for emerging display applications. In terms of mobility performance, LTPS is the clear winner in Table 2. Additionally, LTPS TFTs have much better stability than a-Si:H TFTs. Finally, the availability of CMOS using LTPS means that row and column drivers or other peripheral circuits can be integrated onto the glass substrate, an attractive option. With all of these performance advantages, and despite the substantial penalty in process complexity (and ultimately cost), the case for transitioning from a-Si:H to LTPS for high-performance (and high-value) display applications seemed inevitable.\n\nExcept for the emergence of IGZO. IGZO does not have the virtue of offering CMOS as an option for peripheral circuit integration. Nor does it have as high an electron mobility as LTPS. However, it is amorphous. This is critical. Being amorphous, it possesses the same inherent manufacturing/scaling/cost advantages as a-Si:H involving threshold voltage (VT) uniformity, mobility uniformity, and process simplicity. Also like a-Si:H, IGZO processing is simple. IGZO source/drain contacts can be formed directly by simply patterning the contact metal (or TCO) directly onto an IGZO channel layer. No channel layer contact doping or deposition of an additional doped contact layer between source/drain and active channel is required to form low resistance source/drain contacts, as is the case for aSi:H and LTPS. This simplifies IGZO processing, potentially eliminating one or more process steps. However, IGZO surfaces tend to be highly sensitive so that development of a back-channel etch process such as that currently used in advanced a-Si:H TFT manufacturing appears to be challenging. First-generation IGZO technology will be implemented using etch-stop processing, thus\n\n| Property            | a-Si:H          | LTPS                 | IGZO                |\n|---------------------|-----------------|----------------------|---------------------|\n| Microstructure      | amorphous       | polycrystalline      | amorphous           |\n| VT uniformity       | good            | fair*                | fair*               |\n| VT stability        | poor            | good                 | fair                |\n| Mobility            | ~ 1 cm2 V-1s -1 | ~ 50-100 cm2 V-1s -1 | ~ 10-30 cm2 V-1s -1 |\n| Mobility Uniformity | good            | fair*                | fair*               |\n| Device type         | NMOS            | CMOS                 | NMOS                |\n| Process complexity  | low             | high                 | low                 |\n\nrequiring an extra masking step compared to that of advanced aSi:H TFT processing, but still fewer than required for an LTPS TFT\nprocess.\n\nIn assessing the case for choosing between LTPS or IGZO as a replacement for a-Si:H AMLCD applications, the elephant-in-theroom is a-Si:H process compatibility. For a relatively modest capital investment, an operating a-Si:H TFT fab (perhaps operating below capacity or in the queue for mothballing) can be retrofitted for IGZO by replacing the a-Si:H PECVD channel layer process with PVD IGZO and the SiNx PECVD gate dielectric process with PECVD\nSiO2. With a few exceptions, the a-Si:H and IGZO process flows will look quite similar, having comparable process complexity. Because of the amorphous microstructural nature of IGZO, scaling-to-larger-area-substrates considerations are expected to be similar also, as are cost and yield. If, as expected, the converted IGZO line enables production of high-end displays, the relatively high margins associated with this type of shift in factory output are an attractive prize in the largely commoditized LCD business.\n\nThis is not true when considering LTPS as a possible replacement for a-Si:H. LTPS processing is distinctly different, generally requiring construction of a new fab rather than retrofit of an existing a-Si:H plant. This is an important consideration. LTPS processing is more complex than a-Si:H/IGZO processing, typically requiring several additional masking steps. Elevated temperatures are often necessary for channel dehydrogenation, channel crystallization, dopant activation, and/or interface state control [20].\n\nChannel crystallization is normally accomplished by excimer laser annealing (ELA) which in addition to adding cost comprises a major challenge in scaling to the large glass substrate dimensions necessary for efficient production of TV size backplanes (although we do not dismiss the legitimate efforts underway, notably by Samsung, to work through this challenge). LTPS S/D doping and patterning is more complicated since dopants must be selectively implanted and activated rather than simply incorporated into a doped PECVD layer as accomplished in a-Si:H processing. A lightly-doped drain (LDD) or gate-overlapped LDD (GOLDD) TFT architecture is typically used in order to reduce leakage, adding to LTPS processing complexity. Many of these process steps are not readily scalable to larger substrate dimensions.\n\nA compelling case for selecting IGZO instead of LTPS as an aSi:H replacement was put forward recently by Sharp and may be developed with the assistance of Fig. 3 [21]. Fig. 3 shows an idealized comparison of log (ID)–VG transfer curves for a-Si:H, IGZO, and LTPS TFTs. As indicated in Fig. 3, increasing mobility and decreasing leakage are two primary transfer curve considerations that determine the suitability of a TFT for an AMLCD switching application.\n\nUntil recently, mobility considerations have been primarily emphasized when assessing a channel layer for AMLCD TFT switching applications. In terms of mobility, LTPS is the clear winner (see Table 1), although IGZO offers significant mobility improvement compared to a-Si:H. A higher channel layer mobility is attractive since (i) TFTs may be reduced in physical size and yet still supply the required current, thereby reducing the pixel fill factor, thus reducing backlight power and improving power efficiency (especially important for battery-powered mobile devices); and (ii) the TFT response time will be faster due to reduced parasitic capacitance, enabling increased display refresh rate for sharper moving images and additional content options such as 3D.\n\n![3_image_0.png](3_image_0.png)\n\nAs indicated in Fig. 3, off-state drain current leakage considerations are also pertinent when evaluating a TFT for its suitability for AMLCD switching. Fig. 4 clarifies that there are two primary contributions to off-state drain current leakage, involving leakage in the channel and/or through the gate insulator.\n\nIn terms of off-state drain current leakage, IGZO is the clear winner. IGZO TFTs have lower leakage across the channel because IGZO is a wide band gap [i.e., EG(IGZO) = 3.25 eV] unipolar semiconductor. In contrast, LTPS and a-Si:H have significantly narrower band gaps [i.e., EG(LTPS) = 1.1 eV, EG(a-Si:H) = 1.7 eV] and are bipolar so that channel inversion occurs at sufficiently large reverse gate bias. Under reverse bias operation, leakage through the gate insulator may also constitute a significant contribution to the measured off-state drain current leakage. IGZO TFTs tend to have relatively low gate leakage since they employ a high-quality SiO2 gate insulator (superior to that of SiNx used in a-Si:H TFTs) and they have smooth surfaces so that a uniform electric field develops across the gate insulator/IGZO interface (not the case for LTPS since grains give rise to pronounced roughness at an insulator/LTPS\ninterface). A lower leakage is desirable since (i) less power is dissipated when a TFT is off; (ii) the TFT switch can retain internal pixel charge for a longer period of time so that display refresh rate may be reduced, leading to: (a) reduced power dissipation; and (b) improved touch capability (due to less noise/interference with touch detection since the display refresh and touch-sensing cycles may be interleaved rather than run simultaneously).\n\nTo a large extent, the superior off-state drain current leakage characteristics of IGZO are a consequence of its large band gap compared to LTPS and a-Si:H. A quantitative argument for this correlation between wide band gap and low off-state drain current leakage may be formulated as follows. For a TFT with a perfect gate insulator (i.e., no gate insulator leakage), a lower limit estimate of channel leakage is given by [22]\nJR ¼ qnitchannel sgþ qnisg ; ð1Þ\nwhere q is the electron charge, ni the intrinsic carrier concentration, tchannel the channel layer thickness, sg the generation lifetime, and sg is the surface generation velocity. The key term in Eq. (1) is the intrinsic carrier concentration since it is equal to ni ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n\n## Ncnv\n\np e EG\n2kBT ; ð2Þ\nwhere NC (NV) is the effective conduction (valence) band density of states, kB is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature. Given that the band gap is in the exponential in Eq. (2), its influence dominates in establishing both the intrinsic carrier concentration and the offstate leakage characteristics as per Eq. (1). Since the intrinsic carrier concentration of IGZO is approximately 18 orders of magnitude smaller than that of LTPS, the channel current contribution to the off-state drain current leakage is negligibly small for IGZO compared to LTPS. In fact, it is often difficult to unambiguously distinguish between gate and channel leakage in an IGZO TFT because\n\n![4_image_0.png](4_image_0.png)\n\nthe channel leakage is so small that displacement current artifacts and the lack of being able to establish charge neutrality due to fact that IGZO is a relaxation semiconductor (see Section 5.1) makes such assessment problematic.\n\nAn Eq. (1) comparison of the off-state drain current leakage properties of IGZO and LTPS is a somewhat misleading since it does not account for the possibility of inversion layer formation under reverse gate bias and its deleterious effects with respect to leakage.\n\nIn a relatively narrow band gap semiconductor such as LTPS an inversion layer is readily formed under a reverse gate bias since only a modest surface potential excursion of 0.6 V is required to achieve strong inversion for 1015 cm3 n-type doping. Once an inversion layer is formed, the off-state drain current leakage characteristic is dominated by the inversion layer so that the leakage current increases exponentially with increasing reverse bias. In contrast, for identical n-type doping the surface potential would have to be modulated 2.75 V in order to reach strong inversion in IGZO! These as well as other chemical and physical considerations indicate that the formation of an inversion layer in an IGZO TFT\nchannel is highly improbable under normal device conditions. This is a key advantage of IGZO, in terms of off-state drain current leakage.\n\nIn summary, it appears that IGZO is moving very quickly towards commercialization as a replacement for a-Si:H in AMLCD\napplications. Cost and scalability seem to be the primary driving force for choosing IGZO rather than LTPS. Since IGZO-based products are already being shipped, there do not appear to be any\n'show-stoppers' impeding successful commercialization of IGZO technology.\n\nWe note that in the literature the negative bias illumination stress (NBIS) instability (involving a threshold voltage shift to negative voltages for an IGZO TFT subjected to a large negative applied gate voltage and simultaneous near-band gap optical excitation) is often proposed as the greatest technical challenge facing IGZO TFT technology [14–17,23–37]. Our perspective on NBIS with respect to AMLCD applications is as follows. While this is a legitimate challenge, it is worth bearing in mind that all AMLCD backplane technology channel layers are light sensitive in some fashion.\n\nTechnologies employing a channel layer with a smaller band gap\n(e.g., a-Si:H and LTPS) require light-shielding measure(s) to suppress leakage associated with photoconductivity. NBIS in IGZO\ntechnology is in many respects analogous to photoconductivity problems witnessed in a-Si:H technology. Thus, while IGZO TFT\ntechnology will require proper passivation and appropriate light shielding for viable display backplane use, such measures are already generally employed in Si TFT-based backplanes and thus do not comprise a structural disadvantage for IGZO, although the details of their effective implementation for IGZO's unique light interaction mechanism(s) will likely involve upfront development time and cost. NBIS is discussed further in Section 5.3.\n\n## 4. Active-Matrix Organic Light-Emitting Diode (Amoled) Backplane Applications\n\nAn LCD pixel is essentially a valve that controls the transmitted intensity of light incident from a backlight source. Thus, an LCD is a non-emissive (transmissive) display. In contrast, an OLED is an emissive display. An emissive display offers a multiplicity of advantages including wider viewing angle, higher contrast, faster response time, and lower power consumption. Also, emissive displays have sleek/lighter/thinner form factors that are more appealing to the consumer and are better suited to flexible substrate applications.\n\nPractical LCD and OLED displays require active matrix addressing, giving rise to AMLCD and AMOLED displays. Basically, active matrix addressing involves providing two-dimensional electrical interconnectivity that facilitates periodically selecting and refreshing a pixel so that it sources the appropriate intensity and color of light required in order to present a desired visual image. Active matrix addressing is accomplished using one or more active device(s), usually TFTs, in the pixel backplane. AMLCDs and AMOLEDs require differing pixel backplane architectures in order to accomplish active matrix addressing.\n\nRecall that the architecture of an AMLCD backplane pixel is very simple, consisting of a single voltage-controlled switch. Unfortunately, the architecture of an AMOLED pixel is more complex. An OLED is a current-controlled device. Consequently, active matrix current control is more difficult to accomplish in an AMOLED, requiring more than one TFT per pixel. In addition to requiring multiple TFTs to provide the basic current-control function, current-control circuit architectures are very sensitive (far more than a voltage-control LCD pixel circuit) to variation and drift in TFT parameters, particularly threshold voltage. Since threshold voltage stability and uniformity can be problematic for some TFT families\n(as noted in Table 2 above), this comprises a major factor in implementing an AMOLED backplane with suitable lifetime for display products.\n\nThe simplest practical AMOLED pixel architecture consists of two TFTs and one capacitor (2T + 1C), e.g., Fig. 5. One TFT is used for selecting and charging a storage capacitor during addressing. The second TFT functions as a current source to drive the OLED, based on the TFT gate voltage developed across the charged storage capacitor. The simplicity of a 2T + 1C architecture is very attractive for AMOLED backplanes. However, a conventional 2T + 1C circuit (different than that shown in Fig. 5, having only one select line)\nis susceptible to pixel dimming due to changes in TFT and/or OLED threshold voltage during operation. The 2T + 1C circuit shown in Fig. 4 was proposed by Sony [38,39]. Since Write Select and Drive Select lines can be independently controlled, this circuit may be useful in compensating for TFT and/or OLED threshold voltage drift. Alternatively, other more complex AMOLED pixel architectures employing compensation may be required, e.g., 4T + 1C [40].\n\nThe case for choosing IGZO TFTs for AMOLED backplanes was forcefully made recently by LG Display Co. with their demonstration of an impressive 5500 full high definition (1920  1080 =\n2.1 megapixel) OLED TV using Gen. 8 glass (2220 mm  2520 mm)\n[41]. Although IGZO TFTs were employed, the pixel architecture used was not specified.\n\n![5_image_0.png](5_image_0.png)\n\nRecent publications by Sony provide further support for advocating IGZO TFTs for AMOLED backplane applications [38,39]. They assert that a channel mobility of -16 cm2 V1 s 1 is adequate for realizing AMOLED displays with UHD resolution (3840  2160 =\n8.3 megapixels) at a frame rate of 480 Hz or with 8 K UHD resolution (7680  4320 = 33.2 megapixels) at a frame rate of 240 Hz.\n\nThey are confident that IGZO can meet this requirement since they have demonstrated IGZO TFTs with mobility of 24.2 cm2 V1 s1.\n\nMoreover, they have also developed ITZO TFTs with even higher mobility of 30.9 cm2 V1 s1. Additionally, they describe a novel, 5-mask self-aligned top gate IGZO TFT process with significantly reduced parasitic capacitance and excellent AMOLED brightness uniformity. Industrial reports of IGZO TFT technology improvements applied to commercial AMLCD and AMOLED displays - such as these from Sony - are becoming a regular occurrence at Society of Information Display (SID) and other international display conferences.\n\nIn summary, IGZO appears promising for AMOLED backplane applications. a-Si:H TFTs do not have adequate channel mobility and threshold voltage stability for this application. As is the case for AMLCD trends, cost seems to be the main driving force for preferring IGZO to LTPS for AMOLED applications. Given recent industrial inclinations, we believe that the sixty-four-thousand-dollar question for large-area, high-performance, high-volume displays may soon transition from ''LTPS or IGZO?'' to ''AMLCD or AMOLED using IGZO?''\n\n## 5. Scientific And Technical Issues Of Concern\n\nIn any newly emerging scientific and/or technical discipline, a certain amount of controversy is inevitable. Debate and resolution of such controversies may lead to new insight and perhaps further innovation. Three topics are tagged below as being ripe for further consideration and/or investigation.\n\n## 5.1. Unipolar Relaxation Semiconductors\n\nSilicon is a bipolar semiconductor. This means that it can be readily doped either n- or p-type and that the minority carrier lifetime often plays a central role in establishing the dynamic response of a semiconductor device.\n\nSilicon is also a lifetime semiconductor. In a lifetime semiconductor, the dielectric relaxation time is negligibly small compared to the minority carrier lifetime, i.e., sDR  so where sDR = qe, q = semiconductor resistivity, and e = semiconductor dielectric constant [42]. The dielectric relaxation time is a characteristic time corresponding to the time delay required for majority carriers to rearrange and reestablish charge neutrality if it is perturbed (e.g.,\nby application of a voltage to a nearby contact). The condition sDR - so is readily met in silicon and other lifetime semiconductors, e.g., sDR - 17 ps and so - 0.5 ls for p-type silicon doped to a concentration of 1015 cm3.\n\nIGZO is a unipolar, n-type-only semiconductor. Moreover, it appears that IGZO is a relaxation semiconductor [42] in which sDR is of the same order of magnitude as so. In a relaxation semiconductor, so typically is given by the lifetime of injected non-equilibrium majority carriers. For IGZO, sDR - 3–300 ns, assuming a relative dielectric constant of 5, an electron mobility of 10 cm2 V1 s 1, and an electron concentration -1012–1014 cm3. Estimating so for IGZO is more difficult. Employing the simplistic single-trap model, so = (rvth NT)\n1, where r = capture cross section (assumed to be 1015 cm2 as appropriate for neutral trap capture), vth = electron thermal velocity, and NT = trap density (1014–1016 cm3) leads to so - 10–1000 ns. Thus, these crude calculations suggest that IGZO is a relaxation semiconductor in which sDR - so.\n\n 59 Since IGZO is a unipolar, relaxation semiconductor with a wide band gap, it is dangerous to simply model it as a normal - i.e., lifetime - semiconductor. Can generation–recombination be accurately modeled via standard Shockley–Read–Hall theory [43]?\n\nCan the ni - 108 cm3 intrinsic carrier concentration of IGZO be employed in a semiconductor statistics-based calculation or is this value so small that non-equilibrium, non-steady state considerations render it meaningless [44]? Do technology computer-aided design (TCAD) simulators adequately account for non-lifetimesemiconductor aspects of IGZO modeling [45]? Are quasi-static models adequate for IGZO TFT high-frequency circuit assessment, or are much more complicated non-quasi-static models required [46]? These questions are illustrative of the types of issues that might be useful to pursue in future IGZO studies.\n\n## 5.2. Capacitance–Voltage Analysis And Punchthrough\n\nCapacitance–voltage (C–V) analysis is an effective classical method for assessing the device physics of metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) interfaces in conventional silicon microelectronics\n[47]. Unfortunately, this method has been used - and primarily abused - in attempts to elucidate IGZO-based MOS interfaces [48–49]. The crux of the problem is that silicon wafers are quite thick (e.g., a 300 mm silicon wafer is 775 lm thick) so that a MOS capacitor can be biased strongly into depletion without encountering punchthrough, i.e., a condition in which the depletion layer thickness exceeds the thickness of the wafer or thickness of the relevant layer under investigation). In contrast, most IGZO C–V measurements reported in the literature have been conducted using TFT structures, in which the IGZO channel is extremely thin, i.e., 50 nm. Since IGZO doping is so low and the IGZO channel is so thin, punchthrough occurs almost immediately upon application of a depleting gate bias. For example, a 50 nm thick IGZO layer with an electron carrier concentration of 1015 cm3 will reach punchthrough when the IGZO surface potential is only 5 mV!\n\nThis means that changes in the measured capacitance are almost exclusively established by backside electronic boundary conditions and/or two-dimensional encroachment of the depletion layer with respect to the source and drain. Since C–V curve interpretation is based on assuming one-dimensional behavior of the depletion layer prior to encountering punchthrough, it is impossible to interpret most of the IGZO C–V curves found in the published literature.\n\nAlthough these punchthrough problems could in principle be circumvented with the availability of IGZO channel layers -5–\n10 lm thick, series resistance effects would make it difficult to interpret measured curves in the straightforward fashion expected when the C–V method is employed, and in any case the material properties (microstructure, defect distribution, etc.) of a severallm-thick deposited IGZO may be substantially different than those of a 50 nm film as required for a TFT channel.\n\nA second challenge in making meaningful C–V measurements involves the formation of an appropriate structure for the test. In Si CMOS the Si wafer bulk provides an effectively ideal contact to the semiconductor side of the MOS structure, and the physical contact to the bulk wafer is spatially removed from the electrically active portion of the MOS device. Conversely, in an IGZO MOS\ncapacitor, the semiconductor comprises a thin (50 nm) layer and electrical contact to this layer for C–V characterization is provided either laterally (e.g., from source and drain contacts in a TFTlike structure) or by adding a backside metal contact not present in the corresponding TFT structure. In the former case, the structure is no longer electrically one-dimensional and proper analysis of C–V measurements requires the use of a model that accounts for lateral charge flow from perimeter contacts (which the conventional textbook C–V analysis does not). In the latter case, although the structure is electrically one-dimensional, the addition of an ohmic contact at the semiconductor back surface fundamentally modifies the nature of the structure being analyzed (since the semiconductor back surface is now a metal-semiconductor contact, rather than an insulator-semiconductor contact as in the TFT structure) so that the measured behavior and extracted characteristics are no longer fully representative of the TFT structure of interest.\n\n## 5.3. Negative Bias Illumination Stress (Nbis)\n\nThe negative bias illumination stress (NBIS) instability is a key challenge that appears to have somewhat delayed commercial adoption of IGZO TFT technology [14–17,23–37]. The NBIS instability involves a persistent negative shift in the turn-on voltage of an IGZO TFT when its gate is negatively biased and is simultaneously illuminated with near-band gap energy photons. The physical mechanism responsible for the NBIS instability is controversial.\n\nWe will now concentrate on using Fig. 6 as a means of summarizing essential electrostatic aspects of NBIS. For a more detailed discussion of NBIS, the interested reader is advised to consult the references cited above.\n\nSimple electrostatic charge balance considerations can provide critical insight into the likely nature of NBIS, as summarized in Fig. 6a. The four conduction band profiles given in Fig. 6a illustrate the expected equilibrium (zero bias) band-bending situation if negative, positive or no charge is present at the backside interface, i.e., EC1, EC2, and EC3, respectively, or if positive charge is present at the frontside interface, i.e., EC4. Note that positive (negative) charge present at an interface is balanced by negative (positive) charge in the channel as evident by the negative (positive) curvature of the energy bands.\n\nEC1 illustrates a depleting backside boundary condition. The positive curvature of EC1 in the channel region means that positive charge exists in the channel. This positive charge is balanced by negative charge located at the backside surface. A near-zero turnon voltage is expected for this case if channel depletion arises exclusively from negative charge present at the backside surface/\ninterface. EC1 corresponds to the situation expected prior to NBIS\nwhen the backside surface is unpassivated. Chemisorbed oxygen present at the backside surface constitutes a negative surface charge since formation of a chemisorbed oxygen bond requires electron transfer from the channel layer to the initially physisorbed oxygen. Note that electron transfer to form chemisorbed bonds leads to depletion of the channel layer, thereby pushing the turnon voltage towards zero. NBIS instability is anticipated for this\n\n![6_image_0.png](6_image_0.png)\n\n60 unpassivated case since direct photoionization and/or recombination-enhanced ionization of adsorbed oxygen is expected to negatively shift the turn-on voltage. Thus, suppression of the NBIS\ninstability in a bottom-gate IGZO TFT will require passivation of the top surface.\n\nThe EC2 conduction band profile given in Fig. 6a corresponds to flatband. From an NBIS perspective, the EC2 case is perhaps the ideal situation, as long as the separation between the conduction band minimum and the Fermi level is large enough (i.e., equal or greater than 0.22 eV) so that the electron carrier concentration in the channel layer is sufficiently small (i.e., less than\n-1015 cm3). This will ensure that the turn-on voltage is near-zero.\n\nFlatband implies that a negligible charge density exists at the frontside and backside surface/interface. Since a shift in the turnon voltage requires a change in the charge density at the frontside or backside surface/interface, the NBIS instability is avoided if flatband persists after NBIS testing.\n\nThe EC3 and EC4 conduction band profiles shown in Fig. 6a correspond to accumulating backside or frontside boundary conditions that give rise to strongly negative turn-on voltages, a signature of an undesirable NBIS instability. Thus, EC3 and EC4 conduction band profiles must be avoided in order to eliminate NBIS\ninstabilities. This means that NBIS-induced formation of positive charge at either interface should be suppressed.\n\nTo pursue this further, consider Fig. 6b, illustrating the energy band situation under NBIS. The creation of delocalized electrons and/or holes in the conduction or valence band, respectively, by near-band gap light illumination is mediated by direct excitation from or into subgap states (as shown in Fig. 6b) or indirectly by subgap state ionization after excitation (not shown in Fig. 6b). Under negative bias, the electric field profile in the IGZO channel will tend to drive spatial separation of photo-generated electrons and holes, drawing holes toward the gate insulator interface and pushing electrons toward the back channel (passivation) interface. The accumulation of holes at the gate insulator interface is a unique aspect of NBIS conditions in an IGZO TFT, because as discussed previously the wide bandgap nature of IGZO tends to preclude the formation of a hole inversion layer under normal operating conditions. Under NBIS, the gate bias induced field is a driving force for injection and trapping of holes in the gate insulator, as indicated in Fig. 6b. Depending on the choice of gate insulator material, the valence band discontinuity between IGZO and gate insulator may range from a few eV to zero or even negative. In the latter case, the lack of an appreciable barrier to hole injection means that substantial numbers of holes will be trapped at or near the gate insulator interface producing (after removal of bias and illumination) a band profile EC4 with positive trapped charge and IGZO accumulation layer as indicated [32].\n\nExamination of Fig. 6b indicates that suppression of undesirable NBIS-induced positive charge injection into the gate insulator is best accomplished by (i) minimizing the IGZO subgap state density, and (ii) choosing a gate insulator with a sufficiently large valence band offset with respect to IGZO, in order to provide a suitable barrier against hole injection into the gate insulator under negative bias. As indicated in Table 3, SiO2 appears to be an excellent IGZO TFT gate insulator choice.\n\n| Material   | EG (eV)   | v (eV)   | IP (eV)   | DEV (eV)   | Reference   |\n|------------|-----------|----------|-----------|------------|-------------|\n| IGZO       | 3.25      | 3.9      | 7.15      | NA         | [37]        |\n| SiO2       | 9         | 0.9      | 9.9       | 2.75       | [37]        |\n| Si3N4      | 5.4       | 1.65     | 7.05      | -0.1       | [50]        |\n| Al2O3      | 6.5           | 2          | 8.5           | 1.35            | [37]        |\n| HfO2       | 6.0       | 2.4      | 8.4       | 1.25       | [37]        |\n\nPerhaps the most popular proposed physical mechanism for the NBIS instability is to ascribe it to oxygen vacancies, to assert that an oxygen vacancy acts as a negative-U center, and to invoke persistent photoconductivity (PPC) as the experimental signature confirming negative-U behavior [25–28]. This model is not explicitly considered within the context of our NBIS discussion since it is unclear how it should be formulated within the electrostatic perspective we have employed. Presumably positive charge associated with ionization of the oxygen vacancy into its double positively charged ðV2þO Þ state would be distributed throughout the IGZO\nchannel layer and, moreover, the metastability barrier giving rise to the persistence of NBIS would presumably arise as a consequence of a large lattice relaxation of the oxygen vacancy cavity upon ionization, thereby precluding recapture of ionized electrons.\n\nIf so, it is difficult to explain why NBIS is so much more problematic than PBIS since there is no obvious asymmetry in the oxygen vacancy negative-U model.\n\nIn summary, from an electrostatic, charge balance perspective it appears that minimization of the NBIS instability will require passivation of the top surface, reduction in the density of subgap states in the IGZO, and use of an appropriate gate insulator such as SiO2 whose valence band alignment with IGZO provides a reasonably large barrier against hole injection under negative bias.\n\nThis physical origin of subgap states in IGZO is not yet conclusively established, but is likely due to incomplete oxidation of the IGZO and associated oxygen vacancies, suboxides, and/or variable cation coordination. If NBIS cannot be adequately controlled via materials fixes involving passivation and a reduction of the subgap state density, aggressive light-shielding measures may be required.\n\n## 6. Conclusions\n\nThe future of AOS TFT technology looks very bright. IGZO appears to be an excellent choice for first-generation AOS TFT applications, as witnessed by its recent commercial insertion into AMLCD displays. Also, IGZO will likely be the AOS material-ofchoice for emerging AMOLED applications. Comparing IGZO and LTPS, IGZO offers higher performance in terms of lower off-state drain current leakage as well as simple process and superior scalability (both translating to lower cost), while LTPS is attractive because of its higher mobility and its ability to provide implementation of CMOS circuitry as an option. As AOS technology evolves, it is likely that other materials beyond IGZO will be gainfully employed. We believe that ZTO is one particularly promising candidate material with respect to the always-important factor of cost.\n\nIncreasing mobility is always of interest, and the vast materials space associated with multicomponent AOS compositions provides fertile ground for exploration.\n\nAlthough IGZO technology currently is strongly targeted for AMLCD and AMOLED applications because of the size and potential size of their respective markets, IGZO appears to be a better semiconductor platform than a-Si:H for migrating towards other applications. Thus, other flat-panel display applications such as e-paper/\nelectrophoretic displays and transparent displays or other non-display applications such as RFID or integration with silicon-based integrated circuits are likely to emerge, laying the groundwork for a new wave of TFT innovation and profitable industry growth.\n\n## Acknowledgment\n\nThis material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under the Center for Chemical Innovation Grant No. CHE-1102637.\n\n 61\n\n## References\n\n[1] Hosono H, Yasukawa M, Kawazoe H.

Introduction\n\nOver the past few decades, amorphous oxide semiconductor (AOS) \nthin-film transistors (TFTs), especially amorphous InGaZnO (aIGZO) TFTs, have gained widespread attention in advanced displays and flexible electronics, due to their extremely low offstate current (Ioff), high carrier mobility, low-temperature fabrication process, and good performance uniformity [1]–[3]. As compared to the bottom-gate staggered structure, the self-aligned top-gate (SATG) structure can be potentially free of gatesource/drain (S/D) overlap, and facilitates the downscaling capability with simple processes, which is crucial for obtaining smaller signal delay and increased operating speed [4]. In order to unleash the full potential of SATG AOS TFTs in more advanced applications, it is of major significance for engineers and designers to extract the effective mobility (μeff) precisely for more convincing process evaluation and circuit modeling. However, as the top gate length (Lg) decreases, the proportion of parasitic resistance in the S/D extension region (RSD) sharply increases [5]. Additionally, the inevitable lateral diffusion of donors readily causes the channel shortening effect (CSE) in AOS TFTs with Lg scaling down to below 10 μm [6]. Not only is the effective channel length (Leff) reduced, but the impact of parasitic inner fringing capacitance (Cif), coupling the top gate and the S/D extension regions, may also be enlarged, especially for SATG a-IGZO TFTs with thin gate insulator (GI) [7]. All these elements can contribute to the erroneous assessment of μeff for short-channel devices. Given this, the traditional extraction approach from transfer characteristics may not be able to provide an adequate analysis of the mobility behavior. An alternative method is required for μeff extraction so that most of the disturbances can be properly corrected. The well-known split capacitance–voltage (C–V) technique has been extensively investigated in Si-based transistors for its robustness and simplicity [8]. Also, various modifications have been proposed regarding to the parasitic resistance or capacitance or large gate leakage that occurs in ultra-scaled MOSFETs [9]. Nevertheless, there have been very few detailed discussions on the precise μeff extraction using the split C–V method on SATG a-IGZO TFT with short channel. In this paper, we assess the applicability of the split C–V technique for the SATG a-IGZO TFTs with 10 nm SiO2 gate dielectric. The disturbance items, including channel length reduction (Δ*L), C*if, and RSD are carefully de-embedded for a more accurate μeff calculation. The parasitic impacts on the mobility behavior in short-channel devices are discussed as well.\n\n2. **Experimental Details**\nThe tested a-IGZO TFTs were fabricated with a self-aligned topgate architecture, as shown in Figure 1. 40-nm-thick a-IGZO was formed by DC sputtering on the glass substrate at room temperature. The thickness of the SiO2 GI deposited by plasmaenhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) was around 10 nm, which is aimed for the investigation of inner fringing capacitance impacts [10]. The gate stack was continuously dry-etched using the top gate as a self-aligned hard mask. Argon (Ar) plasma treatment was utilized for S/D doping, followed by the deposition of SiO2 passivation. The molybdenum (Mo) layer was finally patterned as S/D electrodes. The studied devices were isolated TFTs with a gate width (W = 20 μm) and various gate lengths. The split C–V measurements were performed using an Agilent B1500 semiconductor analyzer in a dark environment. By the split C–V approach, taking into account several potential disturbances, the effective mobility can be deduced based on the drain current (ID) expression in the linear region:\n\n$$\\mu_{e f f}=\\frac{L_{e f f}I_{\\mathrm{D}}}{W_{e f f}Q_{a c c}(V_{\\mathrm{DS}}-I_{\\mathrm{D}}R_{\\mathrm{SD}})}\\qquad\\qquad(1)$$\n\nWhere Leff, Weff, Qacc, RSD, and VDS stand for the effective gate length and width, integrated channel charge density, parasitic S/D resistance, and drain-to-source voltage, respectively.\n\nFigure 1. The schematic of the fabricated self-aligned topgate a-IGZO TFT structure.\n\n![0_image_0.png](0_image_0.png)\n\n## 3. Results And Discussion\n\nFigure 2 (a) shows the typical C–V characteristics of SATG aIGZO TFTs with various mask gate lengths (Lmask). The inset in Figure 2 (b) exhibits the potential parasitic capacitance components for SATG a-IGZO TFTs, including the outer fringing capacitance (Cof), Cif, and other parasitic capacitances (Cp). Here, the Cof and Cp are considered to be almost constant, while Cif should be voltage-dependent. Unlike Si-based bulk and fully depleted silicon on insulator (FDSOI) devices, the voltage-dependent Cif component in AOS TFTs cannot be fully shielded at first due to insufficient carrier response, but will be integrated with the intrinsic channel capacitance (Cch) when going into strong accumulation [11]. Also, it should be mentioned that the Lmaskindependent capacitance appearing below the threshold shown in Figure 2 (a) stems from this Cif [8].Considering the Cch is the only part depending both on voltage and effective gate length (Leff), the total measured capacitance (Ctot) can be expressed as\n\n## (, ) = ℎ(, ) + () +  + (2)\n\nWhere VOV (=VGS −VTH) is the overdrive voltage. The effective gate length is usually obtained from a plot of Ctot versus Lmask in the strong accumulation regime [12]. Therefore, a ΔL of 0.47 μm can be extracted from the x-axis intercept of the fitted straight line, as shown in Figure 2 (b), which is quite reasonable for such devices with S/D treated by Ar plasma [5]. Although the extracted ΔL is nearly negligible for the long-channel cases, it would bring about significant errors for μeff calculation as the channel length is aggressively shortened. As for Qacc, ideally, it can be obtained by the integration of C–V curves as [13]:\n\n![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png) \n\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14\n\n$$Q_{a c c}(V_{o v})=\\int_{-\\infty}^{V_{o v}}C_{t o t}(V)d V$$\n$$(4)$$\n$$(3)$$\n\nHowever, using the measured value of Ctot directly may lead to an inaccurate charge integration, given the existing parasitic components as described in the inset of Figure 2 (b). After the elimination of the constant Cof and Cp, the normalized total capacitance (Ctot0) can be expressed as\n\n$$C_{t o t0}(V_{O V},L_{e f f})=C_{c h}(V_{O V},L_{e f f})+\\ C_{i f}(V_{O V})$$\n\nFor the inner fringing terms, we model the normalized total capacitance in Eq. (4) as [9]:\n\n$$C_{t o t0}(V_{o V},L_{e f f})=A(V_{o V})*L_{e f f}+\\,B(V_{o V})$$\n$$C_{o f}+C_{p}$$\n\nWhere A(VOV)*Leff and B(VOV) stand for Cch(VOV, Leff) and Cif(VOV), respectively. Therefore, the corresponding coefficients, i.e., A(VOV) and B(VOV) can be extracted by a linear interpolation of Ctot0 versus Leff, as shown in Figure 3. Taking Leff of 4.53 μm as an example, the modeled values of A(VOV) Leff and B(VOV) are exhibited in Figure 4 (a). A similar peak in B(VOV) versus VOV is observed below the threshold in the SATG AOS TFTs as the characteristic of Cif [14]. Here, the relative error is defined as the proportion of B(VOV) on the A(VOV)*Leff or A(VOV)*Leff+B(VOV), for the impact evaluation of the inner fringing terms on the channel or the normalized total capacitance. As illustrated in Figure 4 (b), the relative error between Cif and Ctot0 can be up to 27% at VOV of 1.5 V, indicating an overestimation of Qacc during the C–V integration process. Note that this kind of overestimation may even be severe in the case of much thinner GI or more drastic lateral donor diffusion.\n\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14\n\n![1_image_1.png](1_image_1.png) \n\n![1_image_2.png](1_image_2.png)\n\n-4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 \n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)\n\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 \nExcept for the correction of Leff and Qacc, the parasitic RSD is another mandatory factor to be estimated. It is particularly significant in the short-channel devices as the RSD may dominate the total device resistance. Figure 5 (a) shows the traditional transfer length method \n(TLM) method for the RSD extraction [15]. A significant VOVdependent RSD is extracted in Figure 5 (b), which can be associated with the variation of carrier density in the inner fringe regions of the channel (or the ΔL region) under various voltages.\n\n![2_image_3.png](2_image_3.png)\n\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 \nAfter correction of all the disturbance items mentioned above, now we are able to utilize Eq. (1) to extract the mobility behavior with Vov more accurately. As illustrated in Figure 6, if the measured raw data of C–V and I–V are directly used for μeff calculation (dashed lines), the mobility decreases with the decrease of VOV, which is generally related to the percolation conductivity mechanism. Note that it also exhibits a notable mobility degradation with gate length scaling. This can be attributed to the increased proportion of parasitic RSD over the total resistance, as well as the increased \n\n![2_image_1.png](2_image_1.png) \n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 W = 20 μm Leff, Qacc, RSD corrected\n\n![2_image_2.png](2_image_2.png)\n\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 \ncontribution of the inner fringing capacitance. However, as all of the parasitic items are considered, the corrected mobility values of a-IGZO TFTs with various Lmask show minimum differences, and are all higher than the uncorrected ones, well validating the effectiveness of the improved split C–V method. Finally, to quantitatively depict the impact of different parasitic items, Figure 7 compares the mobility behavior of the SATG aIGZO TFT with Leff of 4.53 μm under various correction conditions. \n\nAs shown, the extracted μeff indeed increases when only correcting Leff and Qacc, compared with the results from raw data. Besides, the obtained mobility increases more pronouncedly when including the correction of bias-dependent RSD. The results indicate that, for the precision of μeff computation of AOS TFT with SATG architecture, the de-embedding of RSD and Cif in the inner fringe regions of the channel is of great significance, especially for channel lengths smaller than 5 μm.\n\n4. **Summary**\nWe have investigated the applicability of the improved split C–V approach in SATG a-IGZO TFTs with Leff down to 4.53 μm. Precise μeff computation can be performed after carefully de-embedding several relative disturbances, including ΔL, Cif, and RSD. Moreover, the increased contribution of the parasitic capacitance and access resistance in the inner fringe regions of the channel is at the origin of underestimation of μeff, which accounts for the notable mobility degradation with gate length scaling. This method proves very helpful for more accurate process evaluation and circuit modeling in advanced display applications.\n\n## 5.

Especially, PTFE is incorporated in the back channel region of IGZO TFT and this leads to improved electrical stability against positive bias stress \n(PBS) and negative bias illumination stress (NBIS). When compared with conventional IGZO TFT, the threshold voltage shifts of PTFE doped IGZO TFT after PBS and NBIS tests are drastically improved from 4.94 to 1.18 V and 16.63 to 6.31 V, respectively.\n\n$XWKRU.H\\ZRUGV\n7KLQILOP WUDQVLVWRU ,*=2 37)( HOHFWULFDO VWDELOLW\\ R[\\JHQ YDFDQF\\\n\n## ,Qwurgxfwlrq\n\n0HWDOR[LGH 02\f VHPLFRQGXFWRUV KDYH EHHQ UHVHDUFKHG DV\nSURPLVLQJDFWLYHOD\\HUPDWHULDOVIRUWKLQILOPWUDQVLVWRUV7)7V WR UHSODFH FRQYHQWLRQDO DPRUSKRXV 6L 7)7V >@ (VSHFLDOO\\ LQGLXP JDOOLXP ]LQF R[LGH ,*=2\f 7)7V H[KLELW PDQ\\ DGYDQWDJHVLQWHUPVRIHOHFWURQPRELOLW\\WUDQVSDUHQF\\WRYLVLEOH OLJKWDQGXQLIRUPLW\\RYHUODUJHDUHDIDEULFDWLRQ>@+RZHYHU ,*=2 7)7V VXIIHU IURP LQVWDELOLW\\ LVVXHV DJDLQVW YDULRXV HOHFWULFDO LOOXPLQDWLRQ WKHUPDO DQG PRLVWXUH VWUHVVHV $PRQJ WKHVH LQVWDELOLW\\ LVVXHV ,*=2 7)7V H[KLELW VHYHUH WKUHVKROG YROWDJH 9WK\f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f>@7KH37)(LQFRUSRUDWHG ,*=2 ,*=237)(\f 7)7 H[KLELWHG LPSURYHG VWDELOLW\\ DJDLQVW YDULRXV HOHFWULFDO LOOXPLQDWLRQ WKHUPDO DQG PRLVWXUH VWUHVVHV 7KHVH LPSURYHG VWDELOLWLHV DWWULEXWHG WR WKH IROORZLQJ WZR IDFWRUV \f WKH VWURQJ FDUERQIOXRULQH SRODU FRYDOHQW ERQGV ZKLFK ORZHU WKH VXUIDFH HQHUJ\\ RI ,*=237)( ILOP DQG GHFUHDVH LQ R[\\JHQYDFDQF\\UHODWHG WUDS VLWHV GXH WR 37)( LQFRUSRUDWLRQ +RZHYHU VLQFH 37)( LV D GLHOHFWULF PDWHULDO H[FHVVLYH DPRXQW RI 37)( OHG WR GHFUHDVH LQ ILHOGHIIHFW PRELOLW\\ ȝ)(\f RI ,*=237)( 7)7V 7KXV WKH IDEULFDWLRQ ZLQGRZ IRU RSWLPL]HG 37)( FRQFHQWUDWLRQLV UHODWLYHO\\ QDUURZ LQ ZKLFK ,*=237)( 7)7V H[KLELW LPSURYHG WKH HOHFWULFDO VWDELOLW\\ZLWKRXWH[SHULHQFLQJWKHGHJUDGDWLRQRIȝ)(\n,QWKLVUHVHDUFKLQVWHDGRIVLQJOHOD\\HUHG,*=237)(7)7ZH\n7KHSUHVHQWHU,6DN/HH\fLVDVWXGHQW3K'FDQGLGDWH\f\nSURSRVHGRXEOHOD\\HUHG,*=237)(,*=27)7V37)(ZDVFR VSXWWHUHG RQO\\ IRU WKH EDFNFKDQQHO UHJLRQ RI WKH DFWLYH OD\\HU ZKLOHWKH IURQWFKDQQHO UHJLRQLVFRPSRVHGRI ,*=2RQO\\7KH ,*=2 IURQW FKDQQHO LV UHVSRQVLEOH IRU WKH SURSHU HOHFWURQ WUDQVSRUW DQG WKH ,*=237)( EDFN FKDQQHO LV UHVSRQVLEOH IRU PLQLPL]LQJ WKH LQWHUDFWLRQV EHWZHHQ WKH DFWLYH OD\\HU DQG WKH DWPRVSKHUH 7KXV WKLV VWUXFWXUH FDQ LPSURYH WKH HOHFWULFDO\nVWDELOLW\\ZKLOHPLQLPL]LQJWKHGHJUDGDWLRQRIȝ)(FRPSDUHGZLWK\nFRQYHQWLRQDOVLQJOHOD\\HUHG,*=237)(7)7\n\n## ([Shulphqwv Fabrication Process And Electrical Characterization Of Double Layered Igzo:Ptfe/Igzo Tfts\n\n:H XVHG D KHDYLO\\ GRSHG SW\\SH 6L ZDIHU ZLWK  QP WKLFN WKHUPDOO\\R[LGL]HG6L2DVDVWDUWLQJVXEVWUDWH2QWRSRIWKH6L VXEVWUDWH,*=2FKDQQHOOD\\HUZDVGHSRVLWHGYLDDVKDGRZPDVN XVLQJ UDGLR IUHTXHQF\\ 5)\f PDJQHWURQ VSXWWHULQJ DW URRP WHPSHUDWXUH XVLQJ D PL[HG ,Q2*D2=Q2 VSXWWHULQJ WDUJHW WKH PRODU UDWLR LQ ,Q*D=Q ZDV \f 2Q WRS RI WKH ,*=2 ILOP ZH FRVSXWWHUHG ,*=2 DQG 37)( WDUJHW XQGHU WKH VDPH RSHUDWLRQSUHVVXUHIRUPLQ7KH5)SRZHUIRU,*=2WDUJHWZDV IL[HGDW:DQG5)SRZHUVIRUWKH37)(WDUJHWYDULHGIURP WR:>,*=2[:37)([ ±:@$IWHUGHSRVLWLRQRI WKHDFWLYHOD\\HUZHFRQGXFWHGWKHUPDODQQHDOLQJDW&IRU K  QP WKLFN DOXPLQXP VRXUFHGUDLQ HOHFWURGHV ZHUH GHSRVLWHG E\\ VSXWWHULQJ YLD D VKDGRZ PDVN 7KH ZLGWK DQG OHQJWKRIWKHFKDQQHOZHUHDQGȝPUHVSHFWLYHO\\7KH WUDQVIHU FKDUDFWHULVWLFV DQG HOHFWULFDO VWDELOLWLHV ZHUH PHDVXUHG E\\ D +3& VHPLFRQGXFWRU SDUDPHWHU DQDO\\]HU LQ GDUN DW\nURRP WHPSHUDWXUH 7KH ELDV VWUHVV FRQGLWLRQV IRU SRVLWLYH ELDV\nVWUHVV 3%6\fZHUH9*6  9DQG9'6  9 IRU  V 7KH ELDV VWUHVV FRQGLWLRQV IRU QHJDWLYH ELDV LOOXPLQDWLRQ VWUHVV 1%,6\f ZHUH 9*6  í 9 9'6   9 DQG  OX[ IRU V\n\n## 5Hvxowvdqg'Lvfxvvlrq\n\n)LJXUH  VKRZV WKH WUDQVIHU FKDUDFWHULVWLFV RI FRQYHQWLRQDO\n,*=27)7DQGGRXEOHOD\\HUHG,*=237)(,*=27)7V$VWKH 5) SRZHU IRU 37)( LQFUHDVHG ERWK WKH RQFXUUHQW DQG ȝ)( GHFUHDVHG3ULVWLQH,*=27)7H[KLELWHGWKHKLJKHVWȝ)(RI\nFP9VZKHUHDVWKH,*=2:37)(,*=27)7H[KLELWHG WKH ORZHVW ȝ)( RI  FP 9 V 7KLV YDOXH ZDV GHJUDGHG\nDERXW  FRPSDUHG ZLWK WKDW RI WKH SULVWLQH ,*=2 7)7 +RZHYHU ZKHQ FRPSDUHG ZLWK ȝ)( RI WKH VLQJOH OD\\HUHG ,*=237)(7)7VLQRXUSUHYLRXVZRUNWKHȝ)(GHJUDGDWLRQRI GRXEOH OD\\HUHG ,*=237)(,*=2 7)7 ZLWK UHVSHFW WR 37)( FRQFHQWUDWLRQ ZDV VLJQLILFDQWO\\ PLQLPL]HG )RU LQVWDQFH WKH\nsingle layered IGZO:70 W PTFE TFT exhibited 0.13 cm 2 V -1 s -1 showing almost 99% degradation compared with µfe of the pristine IGZO TFT. This was attributed to the role of PTFE as a carrier suppressing dopant especially in the front channel region [9]. When positive gate bias is applied in the IGZO:PTFE TFTs, electrons are accumulated in the front channel region forming a carrier transport path.\n\n![1_image_1.png](1_image_1.png)\n\n(A)\nAs shown in Figure 2 (a), excessive amount of carbon and fluorine originated from PTFE behave as electron trapping sites hindering the movement of electron along the carrier transport path [10, 11]. This have resulted in significant decrease in µ FE of single layered IGZO:PTFE TFTs. On the other hand, as shown in Figure 2 (b), the front channel region of the double layered IGZO:PTFE/IGZO TFT is composed of IGZO only.\n\n![1_image_3.png](1_image_3.png)\n\nThe electron trapping sites originated from PTFE do not exist in the IGZO front channel region and this is confirmed by hysteresis analysis of pristine IGZO and IGZO:80 W\nPTFE/IGZO TFTs shown in Figure 3. We could observe no hysteresis in both devices indicating comparable interface quality of the double layered IGZO:PTFE/IGZO TFT to that of pristine IGZO TFT [12]. Therefore, the main factor for the decrease of µfe in IGZO:PTFE/IGZO TFTs could be due to increased contact resistance between the IGZO:PTFE back channel region and Al source/drain electrodes [13, 14].\n\n![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)\n\nshows PBS test results of IGZO\nFigure 4 and IGZO:PTFE/IGZO TFTs. After 10,000 s of PBS test, IGZO TFT\nexhibited V th shift of 4.94 V towards positive direction. With increasing PTFE concentration in the back channel region, V th shifts of IGZO:PTFE/IGZO TFTs were reduced. Especially, Vth shift of IGZO:80 W PTFE/IGZO TFT was significantly reduced to 1.18 V.  Generally, oxygen molecules adsorbed on IGZO\nsurface from ambient air combine with electrons under PBS and decrease the carrier concentration of IGZO TFTs [5, 6]. Since the back channel region of IGZO:PTFE/IGZO TFTs is doped with PTFE, strong carbon-fluorine polar covalent bonds passivate the surface of IGZO:PTFE/IGZO channel. Thus, the surface energy of IGZO:PTFE/IGZO film is minimized and this leads to reduced interaction between the back channel and oxygen molecules.\n\n![1_image_2.png](1_image_2.png)\n\n] no yandLI snifnO yoliW, yolenvia/J nanit yd 0E14Lqbs/200101/\n(peo) but annot, org soc (tr207/9091)\n000 sail solving VO (osn to solving to the modi.

Introduction\n\nAmorphous metal-oxide thin-film transistor (TFT) backplane technology is expanding in LCD and OLED applications due to its low-cost process, good uniformity, scalability exceeding Gen. 8 glass substrate sizes, and low process temperature [1-2]. Particularly, amorphous InGaZnO (a-IGZO) is most common for its high mobility, low off-current, and sharp subthreshold slope. Top-gate coplanar structures have advantages when compared to the conventional bottom-gate etch-stopper structure, such as lower parasitic capacitance, and better scalability due to an absence of overlap with source/drain metal regions [3]. However, since top-gate structures utilize the top surface of the a-IGZO layer as the conduction channel, device characteristics can be sensitive to subsequent processing. In a previous report [4], top-gate devices suffered Vth shift under positive gate-bias temperature stress (PBTS) conditions due to a higher acceptor-like tail-state density-of-states (DOS) that may have been generated during plasma-assisted SiO2 deposition. \n\nPBTS stability is critical in achieving stable display operation, especially in OLED applications since current-driving TFTs are often in the positive-gate bias situation and small changes in Vth may directly deteriorate image quality. Moreover, robust PBTS \nstability can lessen dependency on variation-compensation driving schemes [5]. In this article, we improve the PBTS stability of top-gate coplanar a-IGZO TFTs by selecting optimum SiO2 conditions. The a-IGZO/SiO2 interface quality is quantified via interface trap density-of-states (Dit) measurements. PBTS characteristics exhibit a high correlation with the extracted Dit. Material analysis technique is used to provide a material basis in relation to Dit, specifically the a-IGZO/SiO2 interface properties for various SiO2 conditions. Results point out that sufficient interdiffusion at the a-IGZO/SiO2 interface is important in obtaining good PBTS characteristics. \n\n## 2. Experiment Method\n\nTop-gate coplanar a-IGZO TFTs were fabricated on a glass substrate as shown in Fig. 1. First, a SiO2 buffer layer is deposited on a glass substrate by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). The a-IGZO (In:Ga:Zn= 1:1:1 at%) \n\n![0_image_0.png](0_image_0.png)\n\nFigure 1. Schematic diagram of self-aligned coplanar a-IGZO TFT structure with top gate.\n\nchannel layer is deposited by DC sputtering at room temperature, followed by SiO2 gate insulator (GI) formation by PECVD. After deposition and patterning of the gate electrode, source/drain (S/D) extension regions are self-aligned to the gate and are formed by dry-etching the exposed a-IGZO surface (including plasma treatment). Inter-layer dielectric is deposited and patterned to form S/D contact holes. Then, TFTs undergo thermal annealing treatments to achieve uniform and stable device performance. Finally, a SiO2 passivation layer and ITO \npixel electrode is formed. Additionally, a replica glass/buffer/a-IGZO/GI stack with the same process conditions as the TFTs is fabricated. The multilayered material stack is used for X-ray reflectivity (XRR) \ncharacterization. Two deposition conditions are used for the buffer layer and GI layer, separately, amounting to a total of four device types. We will denote these device types as: type I (buffer condition A, GI condition A), type II (buffer condition A, GI condition B), type III (buffer condition B, GI condition A), and type IV (buffer condition B, GI condition B). \n\n## 3. Results And Discussion\n\nFig. 2 shows the transfer characteristics of the four TFT device types. There is no considerable difference between the device types. The channel width and length of the device are 12 m and 6 m, respectively. \n\nThe devices are then subjected to PBTS, with stress conditions of VGS=+30V, VDS=0V, 60C for 1 hour. Device type I, II, III, IV suffers a threshold voltage shift (Vth) of 0.68 V, 4.15 V, \n0.45 V, 1.63 V, respectively, under PBTS. Although transfer characteristics did not differ much when buffer and GI conditions were varied, the PBTS stability is clearly influenced by the top and bottom SiO2 layers. Transfer curves shift in the positive direction during PBTS due to electron trapping occurring at the a-IGZO/GI interface or inside the GI bulk. We \n\n![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)\n\nwill focus mainly on the a-IGZO/GI interface to investigate the impact of top and bottom SiO2 layers on device stability. \n\nTo quantify the quality of the top interface, Dit is extracted for each device type by photo C-V measurements. For Dit extraction, we perform capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements under monochromatic illumination at various wavelengths of light following the method in [6]. A Xe arc lamp with a monochromator is used as the light source. A custom-made optical fiber delivery system is used to transmit light from the light source to the device. Fig. 3(a) shows a simple illustration of the measurement setup. Light is projected from the bottom of the device, and the fiber diameter is wide enough to cover the entire device. C-V measurements were conducted at 20 kHz by a LCR meter (Agilent E4980A), with one terminal connected to the gate, while the other terminal connected to the electricallytied source and drain. \n\nThe photon energy (Eph) is ramped from 1.5 eV to 3.2 eV in 0.05 eV increments. Upon illumination of monochromatic light of Eph, electrons positioned at sub-gap energy level of CBM-Eph are excited. The photo-generated charge shifts the flat-band voltage \n(VFB). The C-V characteristics shift negatively for higher photon energy (Eph), or monochromatic light with lower wavelength as seen in Fig. 3(b). Following the method in [6], Dit is expressed as: \n\n$$D_{\\mu}\\Big{(}CBM-E_{\\mu h}\\Big{)}=-\\frac{C_{\\alpha x}}{q}\\frac{\\Delta V_{FB}\\Big{(}E_{\\mu h}\\Big{)}}{\\Delta E_{\\mu h}}\\tag{1}$$\n\nThe extracted Dit profiles from photo C-V measurements of different device types are shown in Fig. 4. We can clearly notice a peak value for all four types centered at 2.15 eV. A sub-gap DOS level approximately at 1eV above the VBM has been previously reported via optical spectra [7-8]. However, the Dit peak obtained from photo C-V is sharper than the DOS peaks obtained via optical spectra of a-IGZO films. \n\n![1_image_1.png](1_image_1.png)\n\nFig. 5 shows the correlation between the extracted Dit and PBTS \ncharacteristics, for various device types. GI conditions are more critical to the stability than the buffer conditions. When GI \ncondition A is applied to the TFTs, Dit is lower and PBTS \ninstability is lessened. When GI condition B is applied to the device, a distinction between the different buffer conditions becomes apparent. In this case, buffer condition B results in better PBTS stability. Since the dominant effect on PBTS stability is the GI condition, we will mainly focus our characterization efforts on the difference between GI conditions A and B. \n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)\n\n![2_image_2.png](2_image_2.png)\n\nXRR characterization is performed on material stacks with different GI conditions to compare the density profile and interface roughness at the a-IGZO/GI interface. Fig. 6 shows the XRR spectrum for GI condition A and B. The measurement spectrum and data fitting results are in good agreement validating the extracted density and roughness values. Density of the active bulk and interface layers, along with the roughness at the a-IGZO/GI interface are listed in Table 1. The density of \n\n![2_image_1.png](2_image_1.png)\n\nthe top interface region is higher for GI condition A. The aIGZO/GI interface roughness is larger for GI condition A. \n\nHence, the boundary layer is thicker for this case due to interdiffusion of adjacent layers, resulting in lower Dit. \n\nTable 1. List of XRR parameters between GI conditions. \n\n| GI condition                   | GI condition        |     |     |\n|--------------------------------|---------------------|-----|-----|\n| A                              | B                   |     |     |\n| Density                        | a-IGZO active bulk  | 5.8 | 5.9 |\n| (g/cm2 )                       | Active/GI interface | 6.1 | 5.6 |\n| ACT/GI interface roughness (Å) | 9.2                 | 7.6 |     |\n\n4. Conclusion We have quantitatively correlated the Dit of self-aligned coplanar a-IGZO TFTs with PBTS stability. Optimization of the GI and buffer layers can lower Dit at the a-IGZO/GI interface that lead to stable PBTS characteristics. XRR results show that a well inter-diffused a-IGZO/GI interface can reduce electron traps. PBTS stability of self-aligned coplanar TFTs can significantly be improved from Vth = 4.15 V to Vth = 0.45 V, \nby lowering Dit by means of optimization of deposition conditions of SiO2 layers adjacent to the active layer. \n\n5.

Ltd, No. 9 Dize Rd, BDA, Beijing, China Email: wangguoyingdbg@boe.com.cn Abstract Kinds of the top gate self-aligned a-IGZO TFTs were fabricated in order to apply in OLED display. The drift of the VTH under various stress conditions is studied systematically. It's found that when the temperature or the light is added, the drift of VTH is relatively large, such as PBTS and NBTIS, so it should be optimized in the process of the device preparation. Firstly, two kinds of devices are prepared. One is added the shield metal layer at the bottom of the device, and the other is without it. It's found that the VTH of the TFT is prone to large drift due to the lack of the protecting of the bottom shield metal. Secondly, the amount of oxygen in the device is particularly important for the stability of the device. Therefore, the stability of the device is investigated by changing the oxygen content of the buffer layer and the gate dielectric layer. Lastly, the drift of the VTH under various stress conditions for 7200s is less than 1V which is controlled within the circuit compensation range. The 14\" 8K UHD OLED display panel with good image quality was demonstrated finally.\n\n## Author Keywords\n\nTop Gate Self-aligned, a-IGZO TFTs, OLED display, Gate-bias Stress Stability 1. **Introduction** \nIn recent years, thin film transistors (TFTs) which use amorphous oxide semiconductors (AOSs) as the active layer materials are of increasing interest around the world because of their grate application value in active matrix liquid-crystal display (AMLCD) and active-matrix organic light emitting diode (AMOLED) display market [1]. Among them, a-IGZO \nTFT was treated as the most promising candidate due to its high field-effect mobility (>10cm2/ V·s), low off current and low temperature processing (<200℃) [2], [3]. \n\nAccording to the direction of the light emitting, the OLED device is divided into two different structures. One is the bottom emitting device, and the other is the top emitting device. As for the bottom emitting device, the light can only partially penetrate from the openings of the driving panel, and most of the lights are wasted. Therefore the aperture ratio of the bottom emitting device is low. What's more, with the improvement of the resolution, the opening rate also decreases. As for the top emitting device, the light is shoot up from the top of the device, so the output is not affected by the bottom TFT. So the aperture ratio can be improved effectively, and theoretically it can reach 100%, which is beneficial to the integration of devices and circuits. Therefore, in order to obtain large size OLED products with high resolution and high refresh frequency, narrow borders and low power consumption, the top gate self-aligned Oxide TFT can be adopted with the top emitting structure [4]. \n\nIn this study, kinds of the top gate self-aligned a-IGZO TFTs were fabricated. The TFTs with this structure have been widely adopted in mass-production in order to get excellent performance due to its advantages like no overlap capacitance between the gate and source/drain and damage-free active layer. Through the induction and reorganization of the experimental data, the drift of the threshold voltage of the TFT under various stress conditions is systematically analyzed. It lays a good backplane foundation for the 14\" 8K UHD OLED display sample panel.\n\n## 2. **Experiment Details**\n\nThe schematic top gate self-aligned structure of the a-IGZO TFTs is shown in Figure 1. And it was fabricated as follows: Firstly, the shield metal was sputtered in pure Ar atmosphere and patterned by wet etching. Then SiO2 was grown by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) as the buffer layer. A-IGZO active layer was grown by DC sputtering in an O2/Ar atmosphere at room temperature, followed by wet-etch in diluted hydrochloric acid and annealed. Then, the SiO2 gate dielectric was grown by PECVD and the Cu alloy was sputtered in pure Ar atmosphere consecutively. As for the top gate selfaligned structure of the a-IGZO TFTs, the gate electrode was formed by wet etching, and then the gate dielectric layer was formed through a dry-etching process with the gate electrode as a barrier layer. Before depositing the interlayer dielectric (ILD) layer, the non-channel region of the a-IGZO active layer is processed to reduce the source-drain contact resistance. The ILD layer was patterned through a dry-etching process to form a source-drain contact hole. Subsequently, for the source/drain electrodes, the Cu alloy was sputtered in pure Ar atmosphere and patterned by wet etching. Finally, a SiO2 passivation layer was deposited using PECVD. All the fabricated TFTs were annealed in air atmosphere. The electrical characterization of the fabricated TFTs was measured using a Keithley 4200 semiconductor analyzer.\n\n![0_image_0.png](0_image_0.png)\n\n3. **Discussion and Conclusion**\nThe difference between the sample A and B is that the sample B has a shield metal. After the preparation of the device, the light are set under the negative gate bias stress (NBIS) for 7200s, where the light intensity is 6000 nits, The light source is located directly under the device, that is, the bottom light. The value of VTH is deduced by plotting IDS versus VGS in the linear region according to the equation:\n\n$$I_{D S}=\\frac{W}{L}\\mu_{E F}C_{O X}V_{D S}(V_{G S}-V_{T H})$$\n\nWhere L is the channel length, W is the channel width, and Cox \n\n![1_image_1.png](1_image_1.png) is the capacitance of the gate insulator per unit area. Figure 2. shows variations of time-dependent transfer \ncharacteristics under NBIS (VGS= -20 V,I=6000 nits) (a) the \nTFT without shield metal (b) the TFT with shield metal. \nIt was observed that the device of sample A under negative \n(NBS, VGS= -20V) gate bias stress for 7200s has no subthreshold characteristics. Obviously, the device of sample B only has the parallel shift in VTH without significant change in the subthreshold swing (SS) values during stress time under the light. It is well known that the oxide TFT itself is more sensitive to the light. Therefore, the electrical properties of the material will change in the light. Especially for the top gate structure, the VTH of the TFT is prone to large drift due to the lack of the protecting of the bottom shielding metal on the active layer. When the device is under the light, the light irradiation produces a pair of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. If the gate at the same time is applied with NBIS, the semiconductor active layer is in the depleted state, because the oxide semiconductor is n type conductive. Then the semiconductor active layer between the upper and lower surfaces will produce pressure drop caused by the hole to the active layer/gate insulating layer interface and the electronic to the opposite direction. The hole which moved to the active layer/gate insulating layer at the interface will be captured or will enter the gate insulating layer in the body. When the stress is revoked, the electron-hole pairs can't be combined in a short time [5], [6]. Therefore, the device without shield metal is seriously degraded under the light.\n$\\left(\\mathrm{l}\\right)$. \n\n![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)\n\nAnalysis of experimental data and theoretical analysis that the shielding protection of the shield metal layer for the device is still necessary. However, the drift of VTH for the sample B with shield metal is still large. If it's applied to the OLED pixel circuit, it is easy to cause many problems of the image display, such as the appearance of the residual image and the line defect and so on. What's more, the devices used in the circuit are affected by light and temperature at the same time. It's necessary to pay attention to improve the stability of the device, such as PBTS and NBTIS. However, when coupled with the temperature or the light, the drift of VTH is relatively large, such as PBTS and NBTIS, which is beyond the scope of the compensation circuit, so it should be optimized in the process of the device preparation. It's known that the shift of VTH in oxide TFTs under gate bias stress has been explained by two mechanisms: charge trapping and defect creation. The parallel shift in VTH without significant change in the SS values during stress time is attributed to simple charge trapping in the gate dielectric or at the channel and the dielectric interface, while the positive or negative shift in VTH accompanying the change in SS comes from the creation of defects within the oxide semiconductor channel material. In the samples, there is little or no change in the SS and μFE under both PBS and NBS for 7200s, which indicates dominate mechanism of electron trapping at or near the active layer and the gate dielectric interface without the creation of new defects. For the a-IGZO TFTs, the amount of oxygen in the device is particularly important for the stability of the device [7]. Therefore, during the device preparation process, the stability of the device is investigated by changing the oxygen content of the buffer layer and the gate dielectric layer which are adjacent to the a-IGZO active layer, so that the drift of the VTH at various stresses can be controlled within the circuit compensation range. The difference between the sample I and II is the oxygen content of the buffer layer. The difference between the sample II and III is the oxygen content of the gate dielectric layer. The experimental data are summarized as follows, as shown in Figure 3.\n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)\n\nThe oxygen in the buffer layer of the sample II is smaller than that in the sample I. From Figure 3, it's known that PBTS has been improved, but NBTIS has been deteriorated. Therefore, reducing the oxygen in the buffer layer will be benefit to improve PBTS, but it will deteriorate NBTIS. The oxygen in the gate insulation layer of the sample III is smaller than that in the sample II. From Figure 3, it's known that PBTS has been improved, but NBTIS has also been deteriorated. Therefore, reducing the oxygen in the gate insulation will be useful to improve PBTS, but NBTIS will deteriorate. It can be seen that reducing the oxygen in the buffer layer and the gate insulation layer is helpful to the PBTS improvement, and the oxygen in the gate insulation layer is more obvious to improve PBTS, but neither of them can improve NBTIS and make it worse on the contrary. So PBTS and NBTIS are relatively opposite to each other. In addition, the VTH shift of PBTS for 7200s is within 0.5V. Under the NBTIS, the VTH drift for 7200s is around -3V, which is beyond the compensation range of the circuit. Therefore, PBTS can be optimized in the process area, while the device can be shading protection to reduce VTH migration under NBTIS. The VTH shift of NBTIS for 7200s after the device optimization is shown in Figure 4.\n\n![2_image_2.png](2_image_2.png)\n\nAs shown in Figure 4, the drift of the VTH under various stress conditions for 7200s is less than 1V which is controlled within the circuit compensation range. Finally, we demonstrated the prototype 14\" 2K FHD OLED display with the top emission structure using a-IGZO TFTs backplane. As shown in Figure 5, the prototype display showed an excellent brightness uniformity without static residual image after 10mins checkerboard cell test, which satisfied the L0 evaluation standard. Besides, to further confirm the high reliability of a-IGZO TFTs with the top gate self-aligned structure, devices was operated under THO (50°C / 80%) and LTO (-5°C) circumstances for longtime. It was found that the backplane still remain working in good condition even after 240 hours.\n\n![2_image_1.png](2_image_1.png)\n\n## 4. **Impact**\n\nIn this study, kinds of the top gate self-aligned a-IGZO TFTs were fabricated in order to apply in the OLED display. Firstly, the effect of the shield metal layer on the stability of the device was studied, and it was affirmed that the shield metal layer on the device has a good protective effect of shading. Secondly, in order to improve the stability of the device, by changing the oxygen content of the buffer layer and the gate dielectric layer which are adjacent to the a-IGZO active layer makes the VTH shift under PBTS and NBTIS for 7200s were less than 1V which is controlled within the circuit compensation range. It lays a good backplane foundation for the realization of large-size OLED display with high resolution and high refresh frequency, narrow borders and low power consumption.\n\n## 5. **Acknowledgements**\n\nThis work was completed in Beijing BOE Technology Group Co.

        "text": "# Mechanism And Reduction Of Drain Current Drop In Ingazno Thin Film Transistors\n\nGuangmiao Wan, Yuzhi Li, Shimin Ge, Xinnan Lin School of Electronic and Computer Engineering Peking University Shenzhen, China e-mail: wanguangm@126.com Abstract—In order to solve the issue of poor gate signal transmission in display panels based on InGaZnO thin film transistors, the panels were disassembled and analyzed. The poor transmissions of the gate signal results from the drain current drop phenomenon of some thin film transistors in gate circuits. When the collision ionization effect occurs in the highresistance region near a drain electrode, the phenomenon could be observed. On one hand, the rate of electron capturing is higher than that of hole capturing, therefore the current of the thin film transistor decreases and the threshold voltage drifts forward. On the other hand, the broken Zn-O bonds caused by hot carriers forming electron trap sites degrade the electron transport. Some measures are implemented to solve the issue of drain current drop. \n\nKeywords-drain current drop; collision ionization; hot carrier; InGaZnO; thin film transistor \n\n## I. Introduction\n\nIn recent years, the need for thin-film transistors (TFTs) \nwith high performance has been increasing on account of the demand for ultra-high-definition (UHD) display, low energy consumption and interactive functionality [1-3]. A variety of technical solutions have been tried to meet these requirements. Amorphous metal oxide semiconductors \n(AOSs), such as Indium-Gallium-Zinc-Oxide (IGZO), \nIndium-Hafnium-Zinc-Oxide (IHZO) and Indium-GalliumTin-Oxide (IGTO), have attained great attention due to their excellent performance in cost-effective manufacturing process, good uniformity and reasonable low off-current [46]. Among them, IGZO has become an industry-standard channel layer because of its desirable mobility, high Ion/Ioff ratio and good long-time stability [7]. \n\nMany studies were performed to improve the performance of the IGZO TFTs. The back-channel etch \n(BCE) IGZO TFTs were prepared to reduce parasitic capacitance and production costs [8-10]. The effect of hot carriers on the IGZO lattice under high field strength has been studied [11]. The source/drain/active layer was split to improve TFT robustness under mechanical bending strain \n[12]. However, there are few reports on the influence of drain current drop (DCD) phenomenon in IGZO TFTs. \n\nIn this paper, 31-inch UHD display panels based on BCE \nIGZO TFTs were fabricated. The mechanism of DCD in Zeke Zheng, Shan Li China Star Optoelectronics Semiconductor Display Technology Co., Ltd Shenzhen, China IGZO TFTs were studied. Relevant measures were implemented to solve the issue. \n\nII. EXPERIMENTAL\nThe Mo/Cu layer was deposited by sputtering and patterned as the gate electrode, followed by the deposition of SiNx and SiOx as the gate insulator (GI) equipped by a plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). Then the IGZO layer was sputtered by magnetron sputtering system from the IGZO targets and further patterned. \n\nAfterwards, the double layered source/drain electrodes consisted of Mo/Cu were sputtered and patterned with a wet etchant. Subsequently, a stacked SiOx/SiNx passivation layer and a polymer layer were deposited by PECVD and patterned. The indium tin oxide layer was deposited by sputtering and patterned as the pixel electrodes. The gatedriver on array (GOA) technology was used in the 31-inch UHD display panels. \n\nIn order to solve the issue of poor gate signal transmission shown in Figure 1, the panels were disassembled and analyzed. All electrical measurements were monitored by a Keithley 4200 source meter. The transfer characteristic curves were plotted measuring drain current (IDS) by sweeping gate voltage (VGS) from -30 V to 30 V with a drain voltage (VDS) of 15 V. The threshold voltage (Vth) was calculated by extracting VGS when IDS reached 1 nA under the condition of VDS = 15 V. The output characteristic curves were plotted measuring IDS by sweeping VDS from 0 V to 50 V with VGS = Vth+5V. The crit voltage was defined as the critical VDS corresponding a DCD \nphenomenon. Some measures were implemented to solve the issue of DCD. \n\n![0_image_0.png](0_image_0.png)\n\n![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)\n\n![1_image_1.png](1_image_1.png) \n\n![1_image_2.png](1_image_2.png)\n\nVcrit=38V\n After DCD\n\n## Iii. Results And Discussion\n\nThe schematic diagram of a GOA circuit in the 31-inch UHD display panel is shown in Figure 2. In order to test the electrical performance of each TFT in this circuit, these TFTs were isolated from each other by laser cutting. Figure 3 shows normalized transfer characteristics of TFTs in a GOA circuit in the abnormal display area. The electrical properties of most TFTs are normal and consistent. The current of T21 tends to be saturated, which comes from the current limiting of the Keithley 4200 source meter. However, the currents of T11 and T51 drop abnormally. This makes the GOA circuit not work properly, which causes poor transmission of the gate signal.\n\nIn order to investigate the cause of this problem, voltage states of these TFTs in actual work were simulated. During the circuit test, multiple electrical signals with different voltages and time sequence were input into a GOA circuit. \n\nThe gate may be slightly open and the drain voltage is much higher than the gate voltage under certain working conditions. A DCD phenomenon was observed. The output characteristic and transfer characteristics curves before and after the DCD phenomenon are shown in Figure 4(a) and 4(b), respectively. With the gate slightly open, the IDS drops rapidly as the VDS exceeds the crit voltage. In addition, the IDS could not reach the previous level after the DCD \nphenomenon. \n\nFigure 5 shows the mechanism diagram of the DCD \nphenomenon in IGZO TFTs. When the drain voltage is higher than the gate voltage, the conductive front channel on the drain side is pinched off, thereby forming a highresistance region. Under the action of a strong electric field, an electron is accelerated to have a sufficiently high energy. And in the interaction with the crystal lattice, another electron transitions from the valence band to the conduction band, thereby generating a new electron-hole pair [13]. On one hand, electron and hole trapping centers are formed on the drain and source sides, respectively. Since the rate of electron capturing is higher than that of hole capturing, the current decreases and the Vth drifts forward [14, 15]. On the other hand, the generated hot carriers are momentarily accelerated by the concentrated electric field. Then the carriers break the Zn-O bond, which is the weakest bond in an IGZO matrix. The broken Zn-O bond forms an acceptor like an electron trap site, which could degrade the electron transport [16]. \n\n![1_image_3.png](1_image_3.png)\n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)\n\n 60 80 100\n\n![2_image_1.png](2_image_1.png)\n\n 320 340 360 380 400\n\n![2_image_2.png](2_image_2.png)\n\nIn order to solve the issue of DCD, some measures were implemented. \n\nFirstly, in terms of TFT design, the length of the conductive channel was increased. Under the same operating voltage, the field strength between the source and drain electrodes will be reduced, so that the impact ionization effect in the lateral direction of the high-resistance channel will be weakened. In order to maintain the original working state of the TFT, it is necessary to increase the channel width while increasing the channel length to maintain the original W/L ratio. Under this condition, the operating current of the device remains unchanged. Figure 6 shows the change of the crit voltage with the length of the conductive channel under the same W/L. As the channel length increases, the crit voltage is increased, which means that this measure is effective. However, limited by the design size of the display panel, the size of the peripheral board area cannot be increased indefinitely. The above increase in TFT size needs to be completed within the range required by the overall size of the display panel. \n\nSecondly, in terms of TFT device structure, the effect of the device film parameters on the crit voltage was studied. Figure 7 shows the relationship between the thickness of the IGZO layer and the crit voltage. As the film thickness of the IGZO layer increases, the crit voltage increases. When the IGZO layer is thickened, the electric field strength between the gate and drain electrodes is reduced. As a result, the ionization effect of electrons in the longitudinal direction of the channel high-resistance region is weakened. The number of excited electron-hole pairs is reduced, so that fewer carriers are bound to the defect center. \n\nFigure 8 shows the relationship between the annealing temperature of the IGZO layer and the crit voltage. As can be seen from the figure, the increase in annealing temperature is beneficial to improve the crit voltage. When the annealing temperature increases, the number of defects in the IGZO \nlayer decreases, which can be characterized by the triexponential microwave photoconductive reflection (μ-PCR) \ntest. In this test, the carrier recombination can be fitted by the following formula [17-19]:\n (1) \nwhere A1 and τ1 are the amplitude and lifetime of SchockleyRead-Hall-recombination (through recombination center), A2 and τ2 are the amplitude and lifetime of less-favorable recombination, A3 and τ3 are the amplitude and lifetime of deep-level defect state capturing, respectively. As shown in Figure 9, with the increase in annealing temperature, the deep level defects in the IGZO layer are diminished. As a result, the number of carriers trapped by deep level defects is reduced, and the crit voltage increases. \n\n![2_image_3.png](2_image_3.png)\n\n 900 1000 1100\n\n![3_image_0.png](3_image_0.png)\n\n 120 130 140\n\n![3_image_1.png](3_image_1.png)\n\nIn addition, the parameters of the SiOx passivation layer were adjusted, which can affect the electrical properties of the TFT by adjusting the number of defects in the IGZO layer [20-22]. Figure 10 shows the influence of power and silane flow rate on the crit voltage during the formation of the SiOx passivation layer. With the decrease of power and the increase of silane flow rate, the number of oxygen atoms diffused from the SiOx passivation layer to the IGZO layer decreases, and then the excess oxygen defect in the IGZO layer decreases, and the crit voltage increases [23].\n\nAfter taking some improvement measures, the abnormal display caused by DCD was resolved. Figure 11 shows a photograph of a 31-inch UHD display panel without poor gate signal transmission. \n\n## Iv. Conclusions\n\n31-inch UHD display panels based on BCE IGZO TFTs were fabricated. In order to solve the issue of poor gate signal transmission, the panels were disassembled and analyzed. The DCD phenomenon in some TFTs results in a poor transmission of the gate signal. When the collision ionization effect occurs in the high-resistance region near a drain electrode, the DCD phenomenon could be observed. \n\nOn one hand, the rate of electron capturing is higher than that of hole capturing, the current decreases and the Vth drifts forward. On the other hand, the broken Zn-O bonds forming electron trap sites degrade the electron transport. After taking some improvement measures, the abnormal display caused by DCD was resolved. \n\n## Acknowledgment\n\nThanks Shenzhen China Star Optoelectronics Semiconductor Display Technology Co., Ltd for providing sample preparation and measurement platform.

        "text": "# Mechanism Of H2O-Induced Instability Of Self-Aligned Top-Gate Amorphous Ingazno Tfts\n\nJiye Li*, Yuqing Zhang***, Hao Peng*, *Huan Yang*, Lei Lu*, Shengdong Zhang**\n,**\n*School of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Peking University, Shenzhen, China\n**School of Integrated Circuits, Peking University, Beijing, China\n***Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe influence of H2O on self-aligned top-gate (SATG) aInGaZnO thin-film transistor (TFT) was systematically investigated by performing the high-temperature high-humidity \n(HTHH) test (50 oC, 80% RH). Though initial electrical characteristics were well maintained, the stability under positive bias stress (PBS) was considerably deteriorated, including an abnormal negative Vth shift, degraded SS, and increased off current. The mechanism of H2O-induced instability was proposed to be the dissociation of H2*O molecules and the* migration of hydrogen (H) atoms into the a-IGZO channel. The hydrogen diffusion and doping effects in SATG a-IGZO TFTs were further proved by SiNx-passivated TFTs with regulated H content in SiNx *layers.*\n\n## Author Keywords\n\nA-InGaZnO, self-aligned top-gate (SATG), thin-film transistors (TFTs), H2O, hydrogen, positive bias stress (PBS), stability 1. **Introduction** \nAmorphous oxide semiconductor (AOS) thin-film transistors (TFTs), with the amorphous indium-gallium-zinc oxide (a-IGZO) TFT being the representative, have been considered the most promising active devices in next-generation displays and large-area flexible electronics, due to their relatively high carrier mobility, steep subthreshold swing (SS), low off current (Ioff), and low-temperature fabrication [1, 2]. \n\nHowever, the realization of these superiorities was often hindered by the inherent sensitivities of AOSs to heat, oxygen, hydrogen, and H2O in ambiance [3-5]. Among these ambiance factors, H2O is a critical issue that would cause serious degradations on the performance of a-IGZO TFTs. Several effects of H2O have been reported in a-IGZO TFTs [4-8], especially for the bottom-gate (BG) structured TFTs where the channels are usually less protective.\n\nAmong various AOS TFT structures, the self-aligned topgate (SATG) architecture can minimize the parasitic capacitance and allow a better scaling capability, and thus is becoming more promising [9, 10]. With the channel in situ protected by the top gate and insulator, the SATG TFT is expected to be more stable against ambient environments [11]. But in our work, after longtime storage in high-humidity environments, abnormal threshold voltage (Vth) shift during positive bias stress (PBS) was observed in SATG a-IGZO TFTs, which indicated the intrinsic stability is far from enough [12]. Therefore, in order to enhance the stability of the device, it is of great importance to clarify the influence of H2O on the SATG AOS TFTs and determine the degradation mechanism of H2O-induced instabilities. \n\nIn this work, the effects of H2O were comparatively investigated on SiO2-passivated SATG a-IGZO TFTs. Firstly, the electrical characteristics were almost maintained after highhumidity tests. However, an abnormal negative shift of Vth and SS degradation was observed under PBS. The underlying mechanisms were verified to be the lateral diffusion of H2O molecules into the TG insulator, their subsequent dissociation, and the resulting hydrogen migration processes under vertical electrical field stresses. Finally, SiNx-passivated TFTs with poor and rich hydrogen content in PLs were fabricated to prove the hydrogen diffusion and doping effects in SATG a-IGZO TFTs.\n\n## 2. Experimental Details\n\nThe schematic structure and major processing steps of the SATG a-IGZO TFT are shown in Fig. 1. On the glass substrate, 40 nm a-IGZO was sputtered at room temperature with a ceramic target of In2O3: Ga2O3: ZnO = 1: 1: 2 mol%. The patterned a-IGZO active islands were treated with the nitrous oxide (N2O) plasma, subsequently covered with the gate insulator (GI) of 200-nm-thick PECVD SiO2 deposited at 300 oC, and then annealed in oxygen (O2) at 300 oC for two hours to form fully-oxidized a-IGZO. After the molybdenum (Mo) was sputtered as the gate electrode, the Mo/SiO2 gate stack was patterned together, and another anneal in O2 at 300 oC was performed for half an hour. Next, Ar plasma was implemented at room temperature to form the highly conductive S/D (Fig. 1(a)). Finally, the 200-nm-thick passivation layers (PLs) of SiO2 were deposited using silane (SiH4) and N2O at 150 oC by PECVD, \nand Mo S/D electrodes were formed with a lift-off process. \n\nIn addition, the high-temperature high-humidity (HTHH) \ntest at 50 oC with relative humidity (RH) of 80% for 24 hours was performed to evaluate the environmental stability of fabricated SATG a-IGZO TFTs. The electrical characteristics of fabricated TFTs were measured using an Agilent B1500 semiconductor parameter analyzer in an ambient atmosphere.\n\n![0_image_0.png](0_image_0.png)\n\nFigure 1. (a) Schematic cross-section and (b) major processing steps of the SATG a-IGZO TFT with PL.\n\n## International Conference On Display Technology 2023 (Volume 54, Issue S1) 3. Results And Discussion\n\nFig. 2(a) and (b) show the transfer characteristics in linear and saturation regions measured at VDSs of 0.1 V and 5.0 V for the SATG a-IGZO TFTs before and after a 24-hours storage test. From the transfer curves measured at the VDS of 0.1 V, the threshold voltage (Vth) was extracted as the VGS corresponding to the normalized IDSL/W of 10−10 A, and the SS was taken as the minimum dVGS/dlog(IDS) for IDS ranging from 10−11 A to 10−9 A, \nand the μFE was calculated from the transconductance (gm). \n\nAs shown in Fig. 2(b), a slightly negative shift of Vth and an increase of μFE were observed after the HTHH test, which might be related to increasing channel carrier concentration induced by the diffusion of some H2O molecules into the channel [13]. Therefore, the almost unchanged electrical characteristics indicated that the Mo/SiO2 stack has a certain blocking effect on H2O molecules in the environment. \n\n![1_image_1.png](1_image_1.png)\n\n-30 -20 -10 0 10 20 30 10-13 10-11 10-9 10-7 10-5 10-3 Drain Current (A) \n-30 -20 -10 0 10 20 30 10-13 10-11 10-9 10-7 10-5 10-3 Drain Current (A) \nFigure 2. The transfer characteristics measured at VDSs of 0.1 V and 5.0 V for the a-IGZO TFTs (a) before and (b) \nafter the HTHH test.\n\nMoreover, the electrical stability of AOS TFTs is also of vital importance to evaluate the reliability of AOS TFTs. Thus, the fabricated TFTs were then investigated by subjecting the transistors to negative gate stress (NBS) and positive bias stress (PBS) with VGS respectively of −30 V and 30 V. \n\nFig 3 (a) shows evolutions of transfer characteristics of fabricated TFTs under PBS of 30 V before the HTHH test, where the drain current (IDS) versus gate voltage (VGS) was measured at the drain voltage (VDS) of 5.0 V. Under PBS, the transfer curves of fabricated transistors slightly shifted towards positive VGS without SS degradation. As normally believed, the electrons could be drifted by positive VGS towards the gate electrode direction and subsequently trapped into GI or GI/aIGZO interface, causing positive Vth shift [14]. By contrast, the TFTs remain unchanged after 3600 seconds of NBS in the atmosphere. \n\n![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)\n\n-30 -20 -10 0 10 20 30 10-13 10-11 10-9 10-7 10-5 10-3W/L = 20 μm/9 μm Drain Current (A) \nPBS\n\n-30 -20 -10 0 10 20 30 10-13 10-11 10-9 10-7 10-5 10-3 Drain Current (A) \n\nStress VGS **= 30 V**\n 0 1000 10 2000 50 3600\n\nFigure 3. Evolutions of transfer characteristics of SiO2passivated TFTs with W/L = 20 µm/9 µm under PBS (a) \nbefore and (b) after the HTHH test.\n\nThe environmental stabilities of SATG a-IGZO TFTs were further evaluated by performing a temperature-humidity test. \n\nAfter being stored in an environment of 50 oC and 80% RH for 24 hours, the transistors were subjected to NBS and PBS again [15]. Fig 3(b) shows evolutions of transfer characteristics of fabricated TFTs under PBS of 30 V after the HTHH test. As indicated by the stress time evolutions of ΔVth in Fig.4 (a), NBSinduced ΔVth was still neglectable, while PBS caused a significant degradation behavior. The TFTs dramatically degraded with an abnormal negative shift of Vth, different from the common positive ΔVth during PBS. In addition, the SS and off current got worse and worse with the increasing PBS time, and the transistor even degraded into a conductor finally. The increased SS value also suggests that the trap state was created at the GI/IGZO interface during PBS. The Nit could be estimated by the SS values using the following relationship,\n\n$$N_{\\mathrm{{it}}}=\\left({\\frac{s s}{l n10}}{\\frac{q}{k T}}-1\\right){\\frac{C_{o x}}{q}},\\qquad\\qquad(1)$$\n\n## International Conference On Display Technology 2023 (Volume 54, Issue S1)\n\nwhere q, k, T, and Cox are respectively the single electron charge, the Boltzmann constant, the absolute temperature in Kelvin, and the capacitance of the gate dielectric per unit area. \n\nThe Nit under PBS was calculated to increase from 2×1011 cm-2 to 7×1011 cm-2. Accordingly, the performance degradation during PBS of TFTs indicated H2O-related species moving and trapping at the interface of GI/IGZO.\n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)\n\n10 W/L = 20 μm/9 μm PBS: before HTHH\n\n NBS: before HTHH\n\n PBS: after **HTHH**\n\n NBS: after HTHH\n\n0 1000 2000 3000 **4000**\n\n4 W/L **= 20 μm/9 μm**\n NBS: after HTHH\n\n PBS: after HTHH \n0 200 400 600 800 1000\n\n![2_image_2.png](2_image_2.png)\n\nFigure 5. (a) Schematic of H2O molecules diffusion during the HTHH test. (b)Schematic of hydrogen-related species migration in the major layers of SATG TFTs under PBS.\n\nAs reported in some a-IGZO TFTs, such degradation of the negative shift of Vth and increase of SS were often ascribed to the absorption of H2O molecules in the environment into the channel layer. However, the almost unchanged initial electrical characteristics after high-humidity tests indicate that H2O \nmolecules may not diffuse directly into the channel layer but only diffused laterally in SiO2-GI during the HTHH test, as depicted in Fig. 5(a). Moreover, considering that the degradation only occurs under PBS, the severe instabilities could be related to the introduction of some hydrogen-related defects into the channel under a sufficiently high positive VGS. \n\nFig. 5(b) shows the schematic of hydrogen-related species migration in the major layers of SATG TFTs under PBS. The process Ⅰ depicts the common mechanism of the positive shift of Vth under PBS [14], as shown in Fig. 3(a). After the HTHH test, H2O molecules in SiO2-GI may be dissociated into H+ions and OH−ions under a certain electrical field [8], as shown in process \nⅢ. However, such an ion drift mechanism cannot explain the H2O-induced significant difference between NBS and PBS instabilities. \n\nAs shown in process Ⅱ in Fig 5(b), the -OH groups in H2O molecules near the GI/channel interface can be dissociated by the energetic channel electrons under a sufficiently positive electrical field [12, 15]. And then the H atoms resulting from the -OH bonds could diffuse into a-IGZO to elevate the channel carrier concentration[16]. Meanwhile, the hydrogen-related defects at the interface can also serve as electron traps [16], leading to a deteriorated SS under PBS. Instead, due to the lack of holes in AOS, no energetic carrier could be triggered to dissociate H2O under NBS, resulting in minor NBS-induced degradation.\n\n![2_image_1.png](2_image_1.png)\n\n-30 -20 -10 0 10 20 30 10-13 10-11 10-9 10-7 10-5 10-3 Drain Current (A) \nPBS\n\nVDS = 5 V \n0 1000 2000 3000 4000 \n\n:H-rich PBS\n\n NBS ΔVth (V) \n\n## International Conference On Display Technology 2023 (Volume 54, Issue S1)\n\nTo explore the mechanism of the influence of H-related species on SATG a-IGZO TFTs in more detail, SATG a-IGZO TFTs with SiNx PL were further investigated. The SiNx PL usually exhibits a better barrier effect against both thermal oxygen and water vapor than SiO2 PL, but it is also well known to contain a large amount of hydrogen, which would diffuse into the GI or a-IGZO layer during the thermal process. Moreover, SiH4 mixed with nitrogen (N2) and ammonia (NH3) is the most commonly used combination by PECVD to obtain more compact SiNx, as well as more hydrogen, while SiH4 combined with only N2 can obtain hydrogen-poor SiNx [17]. Therefore, to further prove the hydrogen-induced negative shift of Vth in SATG a-IGZO TFTs, hydrogen-rich and hydrogen-poor SiNxpassivated (SiNx: H-rich and SiNx: H-poor) TFTs were both fabricated. Both SiNx: H-rich and SiNx: H-poor were deposited at 150 oC. As known, diffusion of hydrogen from SiNx PL to SiO2 GI could occur during the SiNx deposition at 150 oC. \n\nAs shown in Fig. 6 (b), common positive ΔVth during PBS \nwas observed in H-poor SiNx-passivated TFTs without a temperature-humidity test. However, the abnormal negative shift of Vth as well as a larger SS both occurred during PBS in H-rich SiNx-passivated TFTs as shown in Fig. 6 (a) and (b), similar to that in SiO2-passivated TFTs after the temperature-humidity test. Accordingly, hydrogen-induced abnormal negative shift of Vth during PBS in SATG a-IGZO TFTs is further confirmed.\n\n## 4. Conclusion\n\nThe effects of H2O were comparatively investigated on SiO2-passivated SATG a-IGZO TFTs with different stress conditions. Under PBS, an abnormal negative shift of Vth and SS degradation was observed, attributed to the dissociation of H2O molecules and the migration of hydrogen atoms into the a-IGZO channel. Finally, SiNx-passivated TFTs with different content of hydrogen in PLs were fabricated to prove the hydrogen diffusion and doping effects in SATG a-IGZO TFTs.\n\n## 5.

Marks1*** And Antonio Facchetti1,3***\n\nMetal oxides (MOs) are the most abundant materials in the Earth's crust and are ingredients in traditional ceramics. MO semiconductors are strikingly different from conventional inorganic semiconductors such as silicon and III–V compounds with respect to materials design concepts, electronic structure, charge transport mechanisms, defect states, thin-film processing and optoelectronic properties, thereby enabling both conventional and completely new functions. Recently, remarkable advances in MO \nsemiconductors for electronics have been achieved, including the discovery and characterization of new transparent conducting oxides, realization of p-type along with traditional n-type MO semiconductors for transistors, p–n junctions and complementary circuits, formulations for printing MO electronics and, most importantly, commercialization of amorphous oxide semiconductors for flat panel displays. This Review surveys the uniqueness and universality of MOs versus other unconventional electronic materials in terms of materials chemistry and physics, electronic characteristics, thin-film fabrication strategies and selected applications in thin-film transistors, solar cells, diodes and memories.\n\nThe discovery of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) \nexposed new frontiers in large-area electronics1. This semiconductor is a key material for thin-film transistors (TFTs) \nused in display backplane electronics; yet, its low carrier mobility (~0.5–1.0  cm2  V–1  s–1), optical opacity, poor current-carrying capacity and modest mechanical flexibility present challenges for future applications. To overcome such limitations, researchers have explored the use of metal oxides (MOs), which, compared with crystalline silicon and other III–V semiconductors, exhibit unique properties, including excellent carrier mobilities even in the amorphous state, mechanical stress tolerance, compatibility with organic dielectric and photoactive materials, and high optical transparency. Furthermore, high-quality electronic-grade MO thin films are accessible using vapour- and solution-phase methodologies in near-ambient conditions (~25 °C under air), widening their applicability to high-value products such as inexpensive circuits, and to flexible organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays and solar cells on plastic substrates.\n\nThe first MO TFT using semiconducting SnO2 was reported in 1964 (ref. 2), yet it was the more recent work by Hosono that stimulated extensive research and increases in performance3. MO TFTs based on polycrystalline MO materials such as indium oxide (In2O3; ref.  4), tin oxide (SnO2; ref.  5) and zinc oxide (ZnO; ref.  6) were reported. The first amorphous oxide semiconductors (AOSs), whose compatibility with large-area fabrication processes make them technologically appealing, were synthesized in 1954 (ref. 7), yet there was little interest in their properties until Hosono's work on In–Ga–Zn oxide (IGZO) sparked worldwide attention in 2003 (ref. 8). IGZO \nTFTs have since been commercialized in active-matrix displays, joining the widely used transparent conducting oxide (TCO) electrode material, tin-doped indium oxide (ITO). The unique properties of MOs, their synthesis and their use in optoelectronic devices are described in this Review.\n\nOptoelectronic properties of metal oxides Carrier mobility is a key metric of semiconductor performance. Traditional band theory descriptions of transport in semiconductors, including wide-gap ionic MOs, represent electronic structure in reciprocal space, with the conduction band minimum (CBM) and the valence band maximum (VBM) curvatures and dispersions determining the electron and hole effective masses, respectively. \n\nSmaller effective masses mean greater CBM and VBM hybridization, affording larger carrier mobilities, all other factors being equal. Note that transport in MOs is very different from that in Si semiconductors, where hybridized sp3 σ-bonding and sp3 σ*-antibonding states define the VBM and CBM, respectively9. In the oxides of interest here, the VB is typically composed of occupied 2p O anti-bonding states, and the CB primarily of unoccupied ns metal bonding states (Fig. 1a)8. The spatially extended, spherically symmetrical ns-orbital CBM affords small electron effective masses and efficient electron transport even in the amorphous state, because the spherically symmetrical metal s-orbital overlap is minimally affected by lattice distortions. In contrast, the spatially directional Si sp3 σ states experience dramatically reduced carrier mobilities in the amorphous (a-Si) state. Thus, the electron mobilities of AOSs are often similar to those of the corresponding single crystals8, and the subgap distributions of the density of states (DOS) between amorphous covalent (such as a-Si) and amorphous oxide (such as a-IGZO) semiconductors differ greatly (Fig. 1b)9. The subgap DOS in a-IGZO is 10–100 times smaller than in a-Si:H10,11.\n\nMany MO (semi)conductors have energy gaps greater than 3 eV, \nhence, they are transparent in the visible spectrum. Although from a traditional band-structure perspective, high conductivity and optical transparency seem contradictory12; in many (semi)conducting MOs, strong interactions between the O 2p- and metal ns-orbitals produce a band structure characterized by high free-electron mobility (μe) due to the low effective mass and by low optical absorption due to the large bandgap (Burstein-Moss shift) and the low DOS in the CB (ref. 12). However, this unique electronic structure causes a dearth of p-type MOs, as hole conduction is hampered by localized O 2p orbitals and deep VBM levels where holes are trapped by O ions12,13. Band-structure and band-energy modifications are key strategies for the design of p-type MOs, and electrical, X-ray and photoemission experiments argue that greater VBM dispersion is \n\n![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)\n\nachievable using metal orbitals with energies close to O 2p or using more extended anion orbitals, as in CuGaO2 and SrCu2O2 (ref. 14).\n\nIn optoelectronic applications, MO semiconductors compete to some degree with other unconventional semiconductors. The most promising alternatives include organic semiconductors, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and 2D materials such as graphene and MoS2\n(Table 1). Organic semiconductors, both small molecule and polymer, share a common structural motif of delocalized π-electrons and solubilizing substituents (typically hydrocarbons)15. In contrast to MO semiconductors, these organics can efficiently transport holes, electrons or both depending on their structures, and recent advances include very high mobilities, approaching poly-Si. Furthermore, these π-organics are easily solution processed to afford stable formulations and inks, with polymers preferred for printing. However, these organic solids are bound by relatively weak intermolecular interactions, so that post-deposition film processing has stringent process windows to preserve film continuity and morphology. Similar to Si, the largest mobilities are obtained from structures forming uniform, contiguous crystalline domains, with minimum grain boundaries to compromise device metrics and uniformity16. Most π-organics exhibit intense optical transitions in the visible, limiting transparency.\n\nSingle-wall CNTs (SWCNTs) are seamless single-walled graphene nanocylinders17 with typical diameters ranging from 0.3 to 70  nm and lengths reaching the centimetre scale. Depending on their chirality (degree of bond connectivity twisting), SWCNTs can be semiconducting or metallic; for instance, the bandgap for ~1-nm-diameter SWCNTs is ~1 eV - similar to that of Si. SWCNTs exhibit extraordinarily high strength and stiffness, and single SWCNTs can have extremely high hole mobilities (μh) and conductivities. However, these parameters fall significantly in SWCNT \nnetwork films. Single-tube and CNT network-based devices can be fabricated either by vapour phase (typically chemical vapour deposition, CVD) or solution phase (typically spin-coating) processes. \n\nMetallic SWCNT films are now commercially available as viable alternatives to metals and MOs, whereas the use of semiconducting SWCNTs is more limited by process reliability, cost and film performance stability.\n\nGraphene is another promising electronic material consisting of sp2 carbon atom monolayers with a 2D honeycomb lattice18. Single graphene layers are obtained from graphite by simple mechanical exfoliation, and CVD processes can also be utilized for their synthesis. \n\nAs for SWCNTs, graphene also exhibits impressive mechanical stiffness. Graphene is a gapless semiconductor with high μe and electrical conductivity. However, lack of reliable and cost-efficient production of perfectly structured graphene and the gapless electronic structure have to date limited large-scale implementation. Two-dimensional layered transition metal dichalcogenides, especially MoS2, have also advanced rapidly19. MoS2 monolayers not only exhibit good chemical stability, but also unique mechanical and electrical properties 384 \n  \n\n| Table 1 | Comparative metal oxide, silicon, organic, single-wall carbon nanotubes, graphene and MoS2 semiconductor  optoelectronic properties.

MoS2 monolayers can be obtained by micromechanically exfoliating bulk MoS2 crystals, CVD growth, or solution processing and post-annealing. Nevertheless, uniform growth of large-area, high-quality MoS2 thin films remains challenging.\n\nWith respect to these materials, MOs (and AOSs in particular) \nstill present clear advantages for optoelectronic applications as a result of the combination of high carrier mobility, good optical transparency, straightforward synthetic access, large-area electrical uniformity and mechanical flexibility. In the following sections, we focus on MO applications in TFTs (Table 2), diodes, memories and photovoltaics (Table 3), subdividing the TFT section according to their growth methodology (detailed in Box 1).\n\n## Vapour-Processed Transistors\n\nTFTs are 'valves' in which charge transport is modulated by applying two independent electrical potentials (Fig.  2a). These threeterminal devices have a conducting gate, source and drain electrodes contacting a semiconductor, and a dielectric insulator layer between the semiconductor and the gate electrode. Charge carriers accumulate under a gate voltage bias, and drift from the source to drain electrode. The source–drain current scales as the carrier density multiplied by the carrier mobility (μ), the most significant metric in TFTs, and constrains the device operational speed. The current on/off ratio, Ion/off, the threshold voltage (VT) and bias stability are additional important TFT metrics. For TFT fabrication, the semiconductor channel layer, the source–drain electrodes and the gate insulator layer are deposited using either vapour-phase or solution methods (Box 1). Although we focus here on MO semiconductors (Table 2), MOs with more conducting or insulating character can also be implemented in every TFT component, including the gate, source and drain electrodes, and the gate dielectrics.\n\nSnO2 (ref. 2) and In2O3 (ref. 20) films fabricated by thermal evaporation and sputtering, respectively, were the first MO semiconductors used in TFTs, yet they exhibited modest performance (Table 2). \n\nIn contrast, the enhanced crystallinity of ZnO films grown by radiofrequency magnetron sputtering at 25 °C allowed μe of about 1.2 cm2 V–1 s–1 to be reached21, further improved to μe ≥ 50 cm2 V–1 s–1 by using gate insulators with a high dielectric constant k (ref. 22).\n\nIn fact, it has been shown that mobility in MOs displays a power law dependence on k (ref.  23). Recently, flexible ZnO TFTs with μe ≈ 20 cm2 V−1 s−1 have been fabricated using atomic layer deposition (ALD) at 90 °C (ref. 24).\n\nDespite these encouraging results, carrier density in MOs is difficult to control owing to large numbers of oxygen vacancies25,26; major advances were achieved when Hosono and colleagues synthesized IGZO films grown epitaxially on single-crystal yttria-stabilized zirconia substrates3. High-resolution cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy indicates that the InGaO3(ZnO)5 lattice has alternating InO2 and GaO(ZnO)5 layers stacked along the (0001) \ndirection, similar to ITO and Ga-doped ZnO (Fig.  2b). The film/ substrate interface is atomically flat despite the high-temperature annealing (1,400 °C), with the lattice mismatch relaxed within a few atomic layers from the interface. Importantly for carrier stabilization, introducing Ga in the GaO(ZnO)5 layers does not generate carriers as it not only replaces Zn2+ in the tetrahedral sites, but also occupies trigonal-bipyramidal coordination sites, thereby maintaining local electroneutrality. The InO2 layers prevent O2 out-diffusion, which would create carrier-generating O vacancies. IGZO TFTs fabricated using ITO source, drain and gate contacts, and an amorphous HfO2 dielectric exhibited μe = 80 cm2 V–1 s–1 and Ion/off = 106.\n\nThis excellent performance encouraged the exploration of IGZO \nAOSs, and transparent a-IGZO TFTs were fabricated on plastic substrates8. a-IGZO films were deposited at 25 °C by pulsed-laser \n  \n\n| Table 2 | Thin-film transistor metrics for representative vapour- and solution-processed metal oxide semiconductor films.

(PLD) using a polycrystalline InGaZnO4 target, yielding a In:Ga:Zn = 1.1:1.1:0.9 elemental composition. These films are stable up to 500 °C in air and have an optical bandgap of 3.0 eV - similar to crystalline IGZO (3.4 eV). The a-IGZO carrier concentration is tunable from 1014 to 1020 cm–3 by varying O2 partial pressure from 7 to 0.1 Pa (Fig. 2c). The Hall mobility of amorphous and crystalline IGZO film depends on carrier concentration, and the two values converge to ~10 cm2 V–1 s–1 at high carrier densities. Mechanically flexible a-IGZO TFTs on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) achieved μe = 6–9 cm2 V–1 s–1.\n\nThe use of radiofrequency sputtering to fabricate a-IGZO \nTFTs has allowed the intrinsic limitations of PLD in terms of area 386 \n  \n\n| Table 3 | Applications of representative metal oxide materials in microelectronics, including transparent conducting oxides, diodes,  random access memories, solar cells and organic photovoltaics.

Additional device issues, such as bias stress stability, light sensitivity and long-term operational stability, were addressed by post-deposition and fabrication thermal annealing28, encapsulation29 and plasma treatment30. According to DOS modeling31, these processes suppress charge trap densities in a-IGZO, especially tail states near the CBM, thereby enhancing stability. Furthermore, exposing the source and drain contact areas of sputtered a-IGZO films to ultraviolet irradiation dramatically reduces the contact resistivity from 106 to 10–5 Ωcm (ref. 32).\n\nNowadays, sputtering is the preferred industrial process for a-IGZO growth in TFTs for OLED display backplanes. By controlling the process parameters, including O2 partial pressure, growth pressure, target composition, film thickness and annealing temperature, a-IGZO TFTs processed at 150 °C achieve μe = 73.9 cm2 V–1 s–1\n(ref. 33). Beyond a-IGZO TFTs, other MOs are also being investigated (Table 2), aiming at achieving the stability and performance of a-IGZO with simpler compositions.\n\nAll the aforementioned oxides are n-type semiconductors. To date, few p-type MOs have been reported as a result of the aforementioned localized O 2p-dominated VB and high densities of deep traps near the VB. Epitaxial SnOx on (001) yttria-stabilized zirconia at 500  °C yielded the first p-type oxide TFT exhibiting μh ≈ 1.3 cm2 V−1 s−1 (ref. 34). SnOx p-type TFTs sputtered on paper substrates at 150 °C also afford μh > 1 cm2 V−1 s−1 (ref. 35), which were combined with n-type a-IGZO TFTs to demonstrate CMOS \n(complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) differential amplifiers (gain ~4.1 V/V), common source amplifiers (gain ~16.3 V/V) \nand inverters (gain ~4.9 V/V). Besides SnOx, CuOx is interesting due to its high Hall μh; ~100 cm2 V−1 s−1 was achieved because the tetrahedral coordination of oxide ions in CuO2 reduces the localization of the O 2p-dominated VB. However, obtaining high-performance CuOx TFTs remains challenging, due to large hole effective masses and deep VBM levels, and difficulties in controlling hole densities. \n\nThus, although high-quality CuOx films can be grown by PLD on MgO at 850 °C, the resulting TFTs exhibit μh of only 0.26 cm2 V−1 s−1 (ref.  36). Low-temperature CuOx sputtering deposition followed by slow post-annealing at 200 °C yielded high film crystallinity, yet the TFT performance remained poor (μh ≈ 10–3 cm2 V−1 s−1)37. More recently, transparent p-type TFTs were fabricated on glass substrates using CuOx films sputtered at 25 °C with μh ≈ 0.01 cm2 V−1 s−1\n(ref.  38). These data show that useful MO μh values are far from being achieved yet.\n\n## Solution-Processed Transistors\n\nTransitioning film growth from capital-intensive vapour-phase to solution-phase technologies is of paramount importance for MO \noptoelectronics. Indeed, the possibility of fabricating films from liquid precursors in ambient conditions holds great attraction for MOs versus Si, nitride and chalcogenide semiconductors. Progress here has been impressive (Table 2), opening possibilities for MO printing.\n\nSol–gel. In typical sol–gel processes, MO precursor solutions are prepared by dissolving metal salts in a solvent, typically H2O with a \n'stabilizing agent'39. The resulting coordinated metal species undergo 387\n\n## Box 1 | Oxide Growth Techniques.\n\nMetal oxides films can be deposited using vapour- and solutionphase techniques12,13 as summarized below.\n\ncomplex and large-area substrates. ALD processes are typically used to manufacture high-quality MO dielectric films.\n\nVapour-phase processing. There are four main vapour-phase techniques for depositing MO films.\n\nThermal deposition. Thermal evaporation uses a volatile source material under high vacuum to grow films on a substrate of interest, and is widely used to manufacture metallized products. MO film thermal deposition faces several challenges, including: (i)  post-deposition O content adjustment is required to achieve the desired composition, owing to O2 loss during MO evaporation; and (ii) high substrate temperatures are necessary to optimize reactions between ionized species on the substrate, and common plastic substrates are not compatible with high growth rates.\n\nSputtering. Sputtering is a common technique for depositing MO \n(semi)conductors. Most utilized is magnetron sputtering where magnets behind the target enhance bombardment by ionized gases, increasing growth rate and film uniformity. Advantages of sputtering include: (i) film growth near room temperature; \n(ii) compatibility with thermally sensitive substrates, such as plastic foils; and (iii) control of MO film morphology, composition and carrier concentration via the deposition parameters, such as O2 pressure and sputtering power. Sputtering is widely used industrially for metal and MO depositions. Nevertheless, it is costly due to the specialized equipment and targets, especially for large-area growth.\n\nPulsed-laser deposition. PLD is also an efficient flash-evaporation technique where a MO or other target is irradiated with a highpower pulsed ultraviolet laser beam, vapourizing the target material in a plasma plume and depositing it as a thin film. This process can occur in vacuum or in a background gas, such as O2, which is commonly employed in MO film growth. PLD affords high-quality and high-performance films with well-controlled compositions and morphologies. However, it is seldom applicable to production scales because of limitations in large-area film uniformity, low deposition rates and high capital costs.\n\nAtomic layer deposition. ALD films are grown by exposing the substrate to alternating pulses of gaseous reagents that undergo self-limiting chemical reactions. In contrast to chemical vapour deposition, the reagents are never present simultaneously in the reactor, but are inserted as a series of sequential, non-overlapping pulses, resulting in atomic-scale growth. Varying the cycle number enables uniform growth with high precision on arbitrarily hydrolysis forming hydroxides, which slowly convert to colloidal solutions (sol), and eventually to integrated MO networks (gel) containing liquid and solid phases. For TFTs, films are cast from the sol precursors, which are then thermally annealed to condense the lattice and remove volatile organics. TFTs using MO films - including In2O3, IGZO, zinc tin oxide (ZTO), indium gallium oxide (IGO), indium zinc oxide (IZO), and ZnO semiconductors, Al2O3, ZrO2, HfO2, Ta2O5, Y2O3 dielectrics, and ITO, In2O3 and F-doped ITO \nconductors - have been fabricated by sol–gel processing.\n\nAmong MO TFT semiconductors, sol–gel ZnO TFTs were first fabricated by dip-coating Si or SiO2 substrates in zinc acetate–\npropanol or diethanolamine solutions, followed by 900  °C \nannealing40. The resulting devices exhibited Ion/off ≈ 103 and transconductance gm  ≈  0.6  μS, with no other TFT metrics reported. \n\nSolution-phase processing. There are three main solution-phase techniques for depositing MO films.\n\nSpin-coating. Spin-coating is a simple method for depositing optoelectronic films, generally on planar substrates. A precursor solution is applied on the substrate surface, fixed by suction to a holder, which is either spinning at low speed or stationary. Next, the substrate is rotated at high speed to spread the coating material by centrifugal force, coating the substrate with a thin film. Film thickness and quality depend on the acceleration and spinning speed as well as the solution and solvent viscosity, volatility and concentration. Spin-coating is widely used in oxide film microfabrication using sol–gel precursors and in integrated circuit fabrication to deposit photoresist layers.\n\nSpray coating. Also known as spray pyrolysis, spray coating is another simple, inexpensive deposition method for electronic materials, compatible with large-area growth on plastic. Films are typically grown by aerosol spraying precursor solutions onto preheated substrates, where the constituents undergo chemical reaction. These chemical reagents are selected such that all reaction products are volatile at the deposition temperature. Spray pyrolysis is particularly useful for MO depositions, and is a commercial method for fabricating transparent electrical conductors on glass. Spray pyrolysis film roughnesses are typically inferior to those of spin-coated films, but can be optimized by adjusting process parameters. Spray pyrolysis requires low viscosity solutions, which restricts the solvent selection.\n\nPrinting. Printing is an additive process involving simultaneous film deposition and patterning, typically at low temperatures, thereby minimizing chemical and energy consumption. \n\nFurthermore, printed pattern shapes and sizes can be readily modified without process redesign. The most utilized electronics printing techniques are ink-jet, aerosol jet, gravure, flexo and screen printing; note that screen printing is used industrially to create metal lines. Impressive advances have been made in printing organic and MO electronic materials; however, implementation issues at the industrial scale include enhancing formulation stability, broadening process windows, and enhancing film uniformity. Furthermore, for applications such as circuits, resolution and registration must achieve acceptable yields in production. For MOs, high-temperature post-annealing is typically required.\n\nTo lower the processing temperature, the same precursor solutions were used for spin-coated ZnO films, which were then postannealed at 500  °C. Remarkable μe up to 5.25  cm2  V–1  s–1 with Ion/off = 105 was achieved with Al–Ti oxide dielectrics and vacuumdeposited Zn contacts41. Subsequently, ammonia-based carbon-free precursor solutions yielded ZnO TFTs with a μe  ≈  11  cm2  V−1  s−1 with 180 °C processing42.\n\nAlthough less crystallizable than ZnO, In2O3 is an ideal sol–gel TFT candidate, and In2O3 film growth was achieved by spin-coating solutions of ethanolamine (EAA) and InCl3 in methoxyethanol, varying the EAA:In3+ ratio from 0.0  to 15 (Fig.  3a)43. \n\nEAA strongly affects crystallization, with optimal performance \n(μe = 43.7 cm2 V–1 s–1) achieved for EAA:In3+ = 10 and Tal = 400 °C. \n\nThe post-deposition temperature for sol–gel MO films can be 388 \n\n![6_image_0.png](6_image_0.png)\n\nreduced by modifying the thermal treatment conditions (performed under O3 (ref. 44), with controlled O2 pressure45 or in vacuum46) or with specialized precursors. For instance, it has been suggested that additional vacuum annealing at 5 × 10–2 Torr and at temperatures lower than 200 °C facilitates In2O3 sol–gel condensation, achieving μe ≈ 2.62 cm2 V−1 s−1 (ref. 46).\n\nAs with vapour deposition, binary and ternary MO solution processing was also explored. A low-temperature 'sol–gel on chip' route to a-IZO and a-IGZO TFTs (Fig.  3b) was recently demonstrated, where an In alkoxide cluster, Zn(OCH2CH2OCH3)2, and Ga(OCH(CH3)2)3 in methoxyisopropanol  +  2-methoxyethanol were spin-coated and annealed under controlled humidity to enhance hydrolytic film densification47. Amorphous, high-mobility films were optimized using a In/Zn ratio of 7:3 (Fig. 3c). The effects of processing atmosphere (dry or wet) and annealing temperatures were also explored, revealing that wet annealing afforded the highest mobilities (μe = 7–12 cm2 V–1 s–1 on SiO2), near-0.0 V turn-on voltages and minimal hysteresis (<1.2 V). a-IGZO TFTs with low Ga content (5%) annealed at 275  °C also afforded good performance with μe = 4.05–6.12 cm2 V–1 s–1, although such devices were operationally unstable due to the incomplete hydrolysis of the Ga alkoxide precursor. More recently, formamide incorporation (0–100 vol%) in IGZO precursor solutions yielded a higher a-IGZO \nTFT μe, ~10.1  cm2  V–1  s–1 on SiO2 and 50  cm2  V–1  s–1 on high-k aluminum zirconia oxide (AZO) at an annealing temperature of 400 °C (ref. 48).\n\nTo further lower the annealing temperatures, precursor decomposition at ~25 °C by deep-ultraviolet irradiation of the deposited MO films was investigated49. Exposure under N2 to deep-ultraviolet light promoted M-O-M lattice densification in IGZO films prepared using a Zn(C2H3O2)2 + In(NO3)3, + Ga(NO3)3 solution, and composition and microstructure comparable to 350 °C annealed films were obtained. This approach was used to fabricate a-IGZO TFTs on plastic substrates (Fig. 3f) with μe as high as ~7 cm2 V–1 s–1. Positivegate-bias TFT stress tests show excellent operational stability without film passivation, and a small VT shift of 1.12 V after 10,000 s gate-bias.\n\nMetal-oxide heterostructures combining two or more MO layers have been recently implemented in TFTs. Unlike conventional single-channel-layer MO TFTs, these TFTs used spin-coated In2O3–Ga2O3–ZnO–Ga2O3–In2O3 quasi-superlattices (QSLs)50. The performance of these transistors is not limited by the individual semiconductor bulk carrier mobilities, but is instead dominated by the heterointerface structural and electronic properties within the QSL. QSL TFTs processed at 200 °C show μe > 40 cm2 V–1 s–1, far exceeding those of single-layer devices.\n\nSol–gel methods are particularly attractive for their compatibility with printing processes for the fabrication of MO TFTs and other optoelectronic devices51,52.  The first ink-jet printed IZO TFT was achieved53 using aqueous InCl3  +  ZnCl2 solutions printed on Si–SiO2 substrates, reaching μe = 7.4 cm2 V−1 s−1 after 400  °C annealing. Recently, ink-jet printed a-IGZO TFTs, with μe  ≈  10.1  cm2  V−1  s−1 after intense pulsed white light irradiation (100 J cm–2) were demonstrated54. Gravure printing of Zn(C2H3O2)2, In(NO3)3 and Ga(NO3)3 inks was also used to fabricate a-IGZO \nTFTs exhibiting μe  =  0.81  cm2  V−1  s−1 after 550  °C annealing55. \n\nRecently, gravure- and flexo-printing In2O3 (using In(NO3)3 precursor ink), and a-IZO (using In(C4H6NO3)3+ Zn(C4H6NO3)2 inks) \nTFTs were also demonstrated, with μe = 8 cm2 V−1 s−1 after 300 °C \nannealing56, and μe = 9.1 cm2 V−1 s−1 after 425 °C annealing, respectively57. Note that the ultrahigh capacitance and compatibility with printing processes of ion–gel electrolytes make them good candidates as dielectrics for low-voltage MO TFTs. Thus, aerosol-jet TFT printing of semiconducting ZnO (Zn(NO3)2 precursor ink) \nand electrolyte dielectrics afforded μe = 1.6 cm2 V−1 s−1 after 250 °C \nannealing58. However, high-temperature annealing (500 °C) leads to significantly better performance (μe = 12.9 cm2 V−1 s−1) for allprinted a-IZO TFTs59;,hence, further work is needed to make this technology compatible with inexpensive plastic substrates.\n\nThe availability of sol–gel p-type MOs has lagged far behind n-type MOs. To our knowledge, the first p-type sol–gel Cu2O TFT \nwas only recently achieved, with μh = 0.16 cm2 V−1 s−1 obtained using a Cu(OAc)2 precursor solution and a two-step 700 °C annealing process, first under N2 then under O2, which is essential for optimum film morphology and p-type operation. Recently, one-step annealed \n(600 °C at a O2 partial pressure of 2 × 10–6 Torr,) CuOx TFTs were also demonstrated59, yielding p-type TFTs with μh ≈ 0.29 cm2 V−1 s−1. The paucity of p-type MOs suggests a challenging research opportunity.\n\nSpray pyrolysis. Pioneering ZnO studies revealed the potential and versatility of this technique for high-performance MO devices. ZnO TFTs were fabricated at temperatures as low as 200 °C by spray coating aqueous zinc acetate or methanol solutions, achieving μe ~0.1 cm2 V–1 s–1, which increases to ~15 cm2 V–1 s–1 with 400 °C \nprocessing60. Furthermore, low-voltage ZnO TFT operation was achieved by integrating spray-coated ZnO films with high-k gate dielectrics, and a low-voltage (<2  V) unipolar MO inverter was fabricated with two TFTs. Other n-type compositions and conditions were recently explored (Table 2). The only spray-coated p-type TFTs were fabricated by spraying aqueous Cu(OAc)2 solutions on Si–SiO2 substrates at 275  °C (ref.  61). These CuOx TFTs exhibit μh ≈ 10−4–10−3 cm2 V–1 s–1.\n\n![7_image_0.png](7_image_0.png)\n\nCombustion synthesis. An alternative route to lowering solutiondeposited MO film processing temperatures is combustion synthesis, where fuel and oxidizer pairs imbue MO precursor solutions with large internal energies. This creates self-generated exotherms within MO films versus conventional, highly endothermic sol–gel condensations. After precursor deposition and minimal heating to initiate combustion, the self-generated, localized heat drives M-O-M lattice formation and densification (Fig. 3d).\n\nThe first combustion experiments demonstrated In2O3, a-IZO, \nand a-ZTO films fabricated at temperatures as low as 200  °C\n(ref. 62), with redox-based urea or acetylacetone fuel and M(NO3)x as chemical precursor fuel–oxidizer pairs. For TFT fabrication, such combined solutions were spin-coated on doped-Si–SiO2 substrates, the resulting films annealed at 200–400 °C and the process repeated until ~20–30 nm MO films were achieved; finally, Al source–drain contacts were deposited on top. The advantage of combustion synthesis is evident by comparing sol–gel-derived and combustion synthesis MO TFT performance. In fact, processing In2O3 films by combustion at 200 °C yielded TFTs with μe ≈ 1 cm2 V–1 s–1 (on Si–SiO2), whereas sol–gel TFTs are inactive (Fig. 3e). Similar trends hold for the other MO semiconductors, with results understandable in terms of improved film morphology and composition evolution with annealing temperature. Furthermore, In2O3 TFT μe increases to ~40 cm2 V–1 s–1 for an annealing temperature of 250 °C using a higher-k gate insulator. This approach was subsequently expanded to other semiconductors, including indium yttrium oxide (IYO), IGO, ZnO, IGZO, indium yttrium zinc oxide (IYZO), and indium lanthanum zinc oxide (ILZO)63–65. Here a-IXZO (In–X–Zn–O, \nX  =  Ga, Sc, Y, La) compositions clarified how metal X stabilizes amorphous phases and/or acts as an O 'getter' to optimize carrier concentrations and bias-stress stability. MO combustion synthesis has now been reported by several groups (Table 2), demonstrating its generality. To better understand amorphous phase transport in such films, combustion-derived InXO materials were prepared for X = Sc, Y, and La. The results show that cations with radii larger than In(iii) induce amorphous character and achieve high μe at very low X concentrations (~5% for La). Furthermore, increased ionic radii correlate with broader tail-state trap distributions in the trap-limited conduction regime, and with greater potential barrier heights in the percolation regime. These results agree well with local structure information determined from *ab initio* molecular dynamics simulations66. Interestingly, by combining combustion-processed IGZO \nwith a sorted p-type CNT network, antiambipolar heterojunction circuits based on two TFTs and one resistor have been recently demonstrated67, whereas in conventional Si-integrated communications at least seven TFTs are required to create such circuits.\n\nRecently, a versatile new growth process combining spray coating with combustion synthesis (SCS, spray combustion synthesis) \nwas reported68. The combined internal combustion heat and spraysuppressed gaseous by-product trapping during film growth yields 390 \n\n  \n\n![8_image_0.png](8_image_0.png)\n\n 391 ultra-high-quality, dense (by positron annihilation spectroscopy and X-ray reflectivity) In2O3, IZO and IGZO films in remarkably short growth times. SCS produces ~50 nm a-IGZO films (minimal thickness for commercial applications) in ~30 min, with TFT performance far superior to spin-coated combustion films (requiring \n≥4 h growth times) and with comparable mobility, defect densities and VT shift (~1 V) to sputtered films. \n\n## Pre-Formed Nanostructures For Transistors\n\nBesides films, MO nanomaterials have been used in TFT channels. \n\nOxide nanostructures show large carrier mobilities, yet controlling the density and orientation of these nanostructures on a large scale is challenging. The most successful TFTs employ ZnO, SnO2 nanocrystals, and In2O3 nanowires and nanoribbons69–71. TFTs based on transparent In2O3 and ZnO nanowires spin-coated on PET have μe > 500 cm2 V−1 s−1 and ~100 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Ion/off ≈ 106), respectively72. \n\nRemarkably, p-type CuOx nanowires thermally grown on Cu foil at 500 °C and then transferred to Si–SiO2 substrates73, yield TFTs with μh ≈ 15 cm2 V−1 s−1. Advances have also been made in moving from single-wire devices to nanomaterial networks. For instance, ZnO nanorod TFTs with μe  ≈  0.6  cm2  V−1  s−1 were fabricated by hydrothermal growth, immersing spin-coated ZnO nanorod films in aqueous Zn(NO3)2 at 90 °C (ref. 74). Similarly, a ZnO nanowire network was fabricated with spin-coated ZnO quantum dots as seeds, followed by immersion in aqueous Zn(NO3)2 for nanowire network growth at <140  °C (ref.  75). The resulting TFTs exhibit μe = 0.2 cm2 V−1 s−1, but suffer from grain boundary effects. Spincoated ZnO nanoparticles treated with Zn(NO3)2 solutions afford higher μe, ~1.75 cm2 V−1 s−1 (ref. 76).\n\n## P–N Junction Devices\n\nDiodes can be fabricated by combining p- and n-type MO layers to form p–n junctions (Fig. 4a). A conducting anode, a semiconductor p–n junction and a conducting cathode achieve rectifying current–\nvoltage characteristics, for applications such as diode rectifiers, sensors and solar cells. However, MO p–n junctions are rare due to the limited selection of p-type MO semiconductors. The demonstration of p-type CuAlO2 films by PLD growth77, followed by p-type CuGaO2 (ref. 14) and SrCu2O2 (ref. 78) film growth, led to the first MO p–n junction diode in 2000. Such a device was composed of a sputtered SrCu2O–n+ZnO bilayer and ITO electrodes, and exhibited a rectification ratio of ~80 from −1.5 to 1.5 V (ref. 79). In 2008, a p–n junction diode was fabricated with Mg-doped CuCrO2 (p-type) \nand ZnO (n-type) films, using PLD-grown AZO electrodes fabricated at room temperature (Fig.  4b). A rectification ratio of ~50 from −2 to 2 V was reported80.\n\nMO diodes for gas sensors using various p–n junction architectures have been investigated, including semiconductor blends81,82, and core–shell83,84, bilayer or multilayer structures85,86. However, such sensors typically require >200 °C operating temperatures to reach the molecular adsorption and desorption rates required for high responsivity. Recently, resonant tunnelling devices using Cu2O–SnO2 p–n multilayer heterostructures were reported to exhibit excellent sensitivity to H2S vapours at 25 °C (ref. 87). Some studies have also proposed all-MO diodes for photovoltaic cells. Here, Al-doped ZnO(n-type)–\nGa2O3(i)–Cu2O(p-type) thin-film heterojunction solar cells fabricated at 25 °C by PLD gave power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 5.38%, higher than optimized Cu2O solar cells88. Recently, nanosized ZnO(n)–Cu2O(p) and ZnO(n)–TiO2(i)–Cu2O(p) heterostructure diodes were fabricated from vapour-phase-synthesized Cu2O nanowires89, and a PCE of 0.39% was measured, suggesting the possibility of practical nanostructured oxide heterojunction solar cells.\n\n## Memories\n\nRandom access memories (RAMs) are important data-storage components in logic circuits, and MOs are well-suited for resistive RAMs \n(ReRAMs) and floating-gate TFT flash memories (Fig. 4c). So far, several MOs have been employed in ReRAMs, with an oxide layer sandwiched between two electrodes. Key performance metrics are the programming set and reset voltages Vset and Vreset, respectively, and the low-resistance state/high-resistance state ratio90. In 2008, a ReRAM with an Al electrode on top of CuOx–Cu (MO–bottom electrode) was demonstrated, exhibiting programming voltages Vset = 3 V, Vreset = −1 V, and a resistance ratio >103 (ref. 91). ReRAM \nswitching speeds also depend on the memory element size, so scaling down device sizes can increase performance. In another study, 100 nm × 100 nm ReRAMs were fabricated with ALD-grown NiO \nas the MO and Pt electrodes, and exhibited Vset ≈ 1.5 V, Vreset ≈ 0.6 V, \nand a resistance ratio of ~102 (ref. 92). ReRAMs using sol–gel ZrO2 annealed at 600 °C, exhibit Vset ≈ 0.8 V, Vreset ≈ −0.5 V, and a resistance ratio of >10 (Fig. 4d)93. Also, nonvolatile resistance switching was achieved using sputtered ZnO with ITO electrodes on plastic (polyethersulfone) substrates, demonstrating transparent flexible ReRAMs with Vset ≈ 1.5 V, Vreset ≈ 0.5 V, and a resistance ratio of \n~102 (ref. 94).\n\nFlash memories are the most common memory configuration due to their excellent compatibility with the CMOS circuitry used to address each memory cell, and show reliable and uniform memory characteristics, fast switching and non-destructive readout. In the most common flash memories, charge storage relies on trapped charge carriers in a floating gate within the SiO2 or SiNx gate dielectric, or in a non-conductive discrete trapping layer. \n\nMO materials are suitable for memory devices as non-conducting trapping layers in the dielectric or in the TFT channel95. In 1995, a MO memory TFT was created with PLD-grown perovskite semiconducting (La1.99Sr0.01CuO4) and dielectric ((Pb,La)(Zr,Ti)O3) \nlayers. These devices can be written and erased at 7 V with a pulse width of less than 1  ms (ref.  96). Recently, solution-processed TFT-based memories were fabricated with spin-coated MO \nsemiconductor channels (In2O3, IGO) and a solution-processed Cu-doped zirconia (Cu–ZrOx) composite acting as an electrochemical redox trapping layer within the gate dielectric97. Using a high-capacitance self-assembled nanodielectric layer, these TFT \nmemories demonstrated μe ≈ 2.5 cm2 V–1 s–1, good reliability and operation below 3 V.\n\n## Organic Solar Cells\n\nOrganic photovoltaic (OPV) cells are excitonic devices, converting light into electricity, where the p–n junction photoactive layer is composed of organic semiconductors. The most investigated OPV architecture has a bottom TCO electrode, a bulkheterojunction blend of donor (p-type) and acceptor (n-type) \norganic semiconductors, charge extracting layers and a top metal electrode (Fig.  4e). Depending on the semiconductor/electrode interface arrangement, the transparent electrode collects holes and the metal electrode electrons ('conventional' architecture) or vice versa ('inverted' architecture). MOs are typically employed as the TCO electrode or as charge-extracting interfacial layers (IFLs) to enhance PCE. The electron concentration (N) and carrier mobility affect TCO electrical and optical properties, with N affecting both the short wavelength transmittance cut-off limit (band gap) and the long wavelength transmittance cut-off (plasma wavelength)98. \n\nTypically, these optical limitations shift to shorter wavelengths with increasing N, and for solar applications, high carrier mobility and low-N TCOs are preferred. As an exception to this rule, electronic structure engineering rather than doping has been recently used to suppress interband transitions in thermal epitaxy-grown SrVO3 and CaVO3 films, yielding high conductivity and transparency99 even in the presence of high carrier concentrations (N > 2.2 × 1022 cm–3). \n\nStrong electron–electron interactions in these correlated materials lead to low screened plasma energies (<1.33 eV) and good combined conductivity and transparency performance.\n\nWide bandgap MOs, for example, In2O3, SnO2 and ZnO, are useful TCOs by keeping N < 1018 cm–3 and adding secondary dopant ions to increase the optical bandgap (Burstein-Moss effect). Thus, the bandgaps of InAlO (ref. 100) and ZnGaO (ref. 101) (~3.8 eV) \nare higher than the parent In2O3 (~3.7 eV) or ZnO (~3.2 eV) host. \n\nHowever, ITO is by far the most used TCO electrode for organic solar cells (OSCs) considering the low sheet resistance (~10 Ω sq.−1), \nexcellent transparency (optical bandgap ~4.0  eV), minimal toxicity, good etchability and facile film formation on glass and plastic substrates12. Good ITO conductivity minimizes resistive losses to the collecting electrodes, whereas the transparency increases light absorption in the photoactive layer. Resistive losses become significant in OSCs, especially for large-area devices (>0.1 cm2), and simulations reveal that hole-collecting electrode conductivity contributes significantly to these losses102. It has been shown that OSC \nPCEs increase from 5.94 to 8.24%, when the hole-collecting ITO \nsheet resistance decreases from 40  to 5  Ω  sq.−1 (ref.  103). Other TCOs have been utilized in OSCs such as zinc indium tin oxide \n(ZITO; ~10 Ω sq.−1)104 and InxCd1−xO–ITO bilayers (~5.5 Ω sq.−1)105. \n\nUsually, polycrystalline TCO films on plastic suffer from significant performance degradation and cracking on tension and compressive mechanical stress. However, it was recently shown that PLD-grown a-ZITO on AryLite plastic is an excellent OPV electrode, with a sheet resistance of ~20 Ω sq.−1 and superior mechanical stability on multiple bends about a 5 mm radius106. Flexible AryLite–a-ZITO-based PTB7:PC71BM cells provide PCE = 6.42%.\n\nMO films have also been extensively used as IFLs for hole (h-IFL) \nor electron (e-IFL) selective extraction from OSC active layers, both in conventional and inverted device architectures (Fig. 4f). In conventional architectures, MO h-IFLs are primarily used to replace the corrosive hole conductor PEDOT:PSS on ITO. In 2008, the first use of PLD-grown NiO as a p-type h-IFL in P3HT:PCBM cells was reported, yielding an optimized PCE of 5.16% for a 10-nm-thick NiO \nIFL versus 2.87% for the control107. In 2010, solution-processed NiO \nwas deposited by spin-coating a Ni-based ink on ITO and annealing at 250 °C, affording P3HT:PCBM cells with PCE = 3.6% - comparable to PEDOT:PSS cells108. Recently, PLD-grown NiO films were studied as a function of processing parameters, such as atmospheric gas ratio and growth temperature as well as post-deposition Ar and O2 plasma treatment, to assess effects on film electronic structure and OPV performance109. Interestingly, substantial NiO workfunction changes of ~1  eV occur on O2 plasma treatment. Other MOs commonly used to replace PEDOT:PSS as an h-IFL are vapourdeposited V2O5 (ref. 110), MoO3 and WO3 (refs 111,112). The Fermi levels of these materials are very near the CBM and technically are n-type semiconductors113, yet they may function as p-type dopants for the photoactive blend donor material (for instance P3HT) considering that their CBM lies below the donor highest occupied molecular orbital energy114. MoO3 films prepared by spin-coating nanoparticle suspensions exhibit properties similar to vapourdeposited films115,116. Sol–gel deposited V2O5 films spin-coated and then annealed at low temperatures110 yield OSCs with performance comparable to PEDOT:PSS cells but with improved durability.\n\nThe most common electron-extracting MO e-IFLs in conventional OSC architectures typically replace LiF in contact with the electron-collecting electrode, and are n-type TiO2 and ZnO. \n\nFurthermore, amorphous TiO2 films have been fabricated by spincoating sol–gels directly on the OSC photoactive layer at temperatures compatible with the organic materials117. ZnO has a higher μe than TiO2, mitigating recombination losses. Although sol–gels have been used for ZnO IFLs, spin-coatable nanoparticle formulations are more broadly used118.\n\nFor inverted OSC architectures, MOs can be used to switch the ITO function from hole- to electron-collecting, thereby extracting electrons and accommodating high work-function and stable topelectrode metals. Typical inverted OPVs use sol–gel-derived ZnO \n 393 e-IFLs on the ITO electrode119–122, however, Cs2CO3 (ref. 123) and TiO2 (ref. 124) have also been reported. Again, nanoparticle-based formulations allow process simplification, effectively eliminating high-temperature sol–gel annealing and enhancing the device lifetime125. Triple-junction OCSs with multiple photoactive layers have been recently fabricated using Li-doped ZnO interlayers \n(spin-coated, annealed at 100  °C), to achieve a PCE  =  11.83%\n(ref.  126). Furthermore, ITO–ZnO electrodes have been combined with various MO h-IFLs, such as thermally evaporated V2O5 and MoO3, and various organic active materials127. Besides sol–gel methods, ALD was used to grow interfacial MO layers for OSCs at low temperatures128. Using ALD-grown ZnO as an e-IFL (36 nm, at 80  °C) yields P3HT:PCBM cells with PCE  =  4.18% on flexible PET substrates129. Thermally evaporated PbO has also been used as an e-IFL for inverted devices, lowering the ITO work function by ~1 eV (ref. 130). PbO-based P3HT:PCBM cells in combination with a MoO3 h-IFL at the metal hole-collecting electrode give PCEs of ~4.00%. Regarding h-IFLs, amorphous V2O5 solutions processed at ~100 °C (ref.  131) and CuOx sol–gels have also been used in inverted P3HT:PCBM cells132. Similar to p-type NiO, CuOx has a CBM at ~5.3 eV, matching the P3HT highest occupied molecular orbital for hole extraction. Such cells have a PCE of ~4.02% with stability >1,000 h.\n\nIt should be mentioned that metal nanowire meshes - typically silver nanowire (AgNW) networks - have emerged as promising electrodes for OSCs. However, due to the large injection barrier between AgNWs and organic semiconductors, the OSCs suffer low performance. Therefore, MO h-IFLs and/or e-IFLs are also used to replace PEDOT:PSS and/or LiF, respectively. Inverted P3HT:PCBM cells with a AgNW-based electron-collecting electrode utilized spin-coated TiOx and evaporated MoOx as the e-IFL and h-IFL, \nrespectively, affording a PCE of 3.1% versus 2.0% for PEDOT:PSS \nh-IFL devices133. Recently, fully printed tandem OSCs on PET plastic substrates using AgNW-based electron-collecting electrodes and ZnO e-IFLs achieved an optimized PCE of 4.85% (ref. 134). These results demonstrate the potential of combining these two types of materials to engineer transparent electrodes.\n\n## Outlook\n\nGreat progress has been made in understanding and implementing new metal oxide optoelectronic materials, including crystalline and amorphous transparent conductors (TCOs) and semiconductors. These materials now rival and complement other unconventional semiconductors such as organics, CNTs and 2D \nmaterials. Capitalizing on unique MO properties, numerous electronic and optical devices have been demonstrated, with many notable advances in the past several years. These include the following: (i) Advances in p-type semiconductors, opening possibilities for p-type TFTs, p–n junctions and oxide CMOS. Considering that, in contrast to organics and CNTs, MO transport has been largely limited to electrons, this advance significantly changes our understanding of how MOs can be tuned for new functions. Nevertheless, additional fundamental studies are needed to bridge the performance gap between n- and p-type MO semiconductors. (ii) The demonstration of unique charge-transport properties of AOSs versus a-Si:H and a-chalcogenides, which enable performance not possible in a-chalcogenide materials. (iii) Low-temperature film growth on diverse substrates, including plastics, by a variety of techniques. This has enabled the realization of high performance, flexible, and transparent TFTs, with IGZO currently commercialized for OLED and next-generation liquid-crystal display backplane drivers. An interesting question is whether less complex MOs can achieve IGZO performance and stability, with broader process windows. (iv) Advances in solution-based MO deposition via numerous new techniques, including those using MO nanoparticles and nanowires. Various direct solution-phase MO film growth techniques have been developed, including sol–gel, spray pyrolysis, chemical bath deposition, direct oxidation of solution-deposited precursors and combustion synthesis. In optimum cases, the performance approaches that achieved by capital-intensive vapour-phase growth technologies. Although MO processing temperatures for optimal performance remain higher than those of the best organic semiconductor devices, the gap between performance and processing temperature is falling. Given the excellent stability and transparency of a-MOs, it is likely that further understanding-based optimization will yield performance more comparable to gas-phase growth; this, together with the excellent stability and transparency of AOS, will lead to the realization of high-performance, large-area electronics on a wide range of substrates.\n\n## Received 25 August 2015; Accepted 15 February 2016; Published Online 23 March 2016 References\n\n1.

Mater. Interfaces 2021, 13, 11442−11448 Read Online\n\n![0_image_0.png](0_image_0.png)\n\nABSTRACT: In this paper, the aluminum (Al) treatment-induced doping effect on the formation of conductive source-drain (SD)\nregions of self-aligned top-gate (SATG) amorphous indium gallium zinc oxide (a-InGaZnO or a-IGZO) thin-film transistors (TFTs) is systematically investigated. Average carrier concentration over 1 ×\n1020 cm−3 and sheet resistance of around 500 Ω/sq result from the Al reaction doping. It is shown that the doping effect is of bulk despite the treatment at the surface. The doping process is disclosed to be a chemical oxidation−reduction reaction, that generates defects of oxygen vacancies and metal interstitials at the metal/a-IGZO interface. Both the generated oxygen vacancies and metal interstitials act as shallow donors, and the oxygen vacancies diffuse rapidly, leading to the bulk-doping effect. The fabricated SATG a-IGZO TFTs with the Al reaction-doped SD regions exhibit both high performance and excellent stability, featuring a low width-normalized SD resistance of about 10 Ω cm, a decent saturation mobility of 13 cm2/(V s), an off current below 1 × 10−13 A, a threshold voltage of 0.5 V, a slight hysteresis of −0.02 V, and a less than 0.1 V threshold voltage shift under 30 V gate bias stresses for 2000 s.\n\nKEYWORDS: amorphous oxide semiconductors (AOS), amorphous indium−gallium-zinc oxide (a-IGZO), metal treatment, oxidation−reduction reaction, oxygen vacancy diffusion, bulk-doping effect, thin-film transistors (TFT)\n- INTRODUCTION\nMetal oxides have been applied in broad fields because of their adjustable electrical, optical, and magnetic properties, such as power electronics, emerging logic devices, data storage, optics, and magnonics.1 Among metal oxides, the amorphous oxide semiconductor (AOS) composed of heavy metal cations has been demonstrated to have high mobility and excellent uniformity over large area, and thus considered as one of the most promising channel materials for the next generation of thin-film transistors (TFTs).2,3 The AOS TFTs have attracted considerable attention in recent years for their potential applications in large-area electronics.3 To date, various AOS\nTFTs have been investigated, such as amorphous ZnSnO (aZTO),3−5 InZnO (a-IZO),3,6,7 HfInZnO (a-HIZO),3,8 and InGaZnO (a-IGZO).2,3,9−15 Among these, the a-IGZO TFTs have been investigated most extensively, as they generally exhibit a good balance between performance and stability.\n\nThe AOS TFTs are usually in either bottom-gate (BG) or top-gate (TG) structures. Although the BG structure, such as the back-channel-etched structure7−10 and the etch-stop-layer structure,11,12 has the potential advantage of low fabrication\n\nACCESS Metrics & More Article Recommendations *sı Supporting Information\ncost because there are fewer process steps, the TG structure is more suitable for applications in the advanced large-area electronics and integrated circuits. In general, the TG structure can minimize the parasitic capacitance and device footprint and enhance the device scalability if the self-aligned (SA)\nsource-drain (SD) regions are equipped.13−17 On the other hand, the SD resistance (RSD) is a key parasitic component of SATG TFTs, which has to be minimized. The RSD is mainly composed of the metal contact resistance and the series resistance in SD regions. The contact usually could be Ohmic by using proper metals with matching work function.18 The implementation of the low series resistance of AOS SD regions has turned out to be a big challenge.\n\nReceived: November 26, 2020\n\n![0_image_1.png](0_image_1.png) Accepted: February 4, 2021 Published: February 16, 2021\n\nTo date, several implementation schemes involving heavily doping the SD regions of SATG AOS TFTs have been investigated, such as plasma treatment,14−17 hydrogen doping,15,19 ion implantation,20−22 and metal reaction.23−29 Among them, plasma treatment suffers from a thermal instability issue. The hydrogen doping usually brought about a serious and uncontrollable lateral hydrogen diffusion from the SD regions into channel region. The ion implantation has not so far been demonstrated to be an effective way of metalizing AOS. In contrast, the metal reaction treatment has been well demonstrated to provide SATG AOS TFTs with thermally stable low-resistance SD, and meanwhile induce less serious channel length shrinking.25,26,28 Although the effectiveness of the metal reaction treatment has been commonly verified, the mechanism behind the metal reaction-induced AOS metallization has not been clarified so far. Morosawa et al.\n\nascribed the high conductance to the metal ion substitution, for instance, Al3+ ions substituting the sites of Zn2+ ions to supply carriers in the aluminum (Al) reaction-treated a-IGZO. It was also inferred that the resultant carriers are distributed close to the surface because the Al diffusion depth was found to be within 10 nm.23−25 However, it was suggested elsewhere that the high conductance should be formed by the chemical oxidation−reduction reaction at the metal/AOS interface.27−29 In this work, we observed that the resultant conducting effect is in a bulk behavior although the metal reaction happens at the metal/AOS interface. To clarify the metal reactioninduced bulk-doping effect, we performed a thorough experimental investigation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses reveal that in addition to a large amount of oxygen vacancies, metallic indium (In) interstitials are also generated at the Al/a-IGZO interface, indicating an oxidation−\nreduction reaction between a-IGZO and Al. The depth profile of XPS discloses that the generated oxygen vacancies distribute almost throughout the whole bulk of the a-IGZO layer, whereas the In interstitials are located only near the surface. It is thus clarified that the oxygen vacancies generated by the oxidation−reduction reaction and their in suit thermal diffusion into a-IGZO bulk are together responsible for the bulk-doping effect.\n\n- EXPERIMENTAL SECTION\nThe experimental details of the metal-reaction doping are described as following. First, the a-IGZO films were deposited on the 2 in. glass substrates by direct-current (DC) sputtering at room temperature. The work gas pressure and DC power were 0.4 Pa and 100 W, respectively. The target is 4 in. in diameter. The atomic ratio of In:Ga:Zn in the target is 1:1:1 and that of the deposited a-IGZO films was measured by XPS to be 1:1.14:0.91. The ratio of 1:1:1 has been widely used since it enables TFTs to achieve a balance between mobility and stability.2,3,30,31 The thickness of the deposited films varied from 20 to 210 nm. Nine samples for each case were prepared in three batches with the error of film thickness less than 6 nm (±3 nm). Then the samples were thermally annealed at 300 °C for 90 min in oxygen. Following, an ultrathin Al film with a thickness around 5 nm was deposited on the a-IGZO films by DC sputtering at room temperature. Next, the resultant samples were annealed at 200 °C for 30 min in air. Finally, the samples were soaked in 2.38% TMAH for 30 s to remove the generated alumina. The electrical characteristics of the processed a-IGZO films, such as the sheet resistance (Rsheet),\naverage carrier concentration, and hall mobility, were measured by the HMS-3000 Hall effect measurement system in dark at 296 K.\n\nX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses were conducted using a Thermo Fisher ESCALAB 250X interface analysis system equipped with a monochromatized Al anode X-ray source (hυ =\n1486.6 eV). The cross-sectional microstructures of the Al reactiontreated a-IGZO samples were studied using a JEOL JEM2010-FEF\nhigh-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM). The elemental composition and distribution were analyzed by the energydispersive spectroscopy (EDS).\n\nThe process flow of the SATG a-IGZO TFTs here is similar to the previously reported one,28 except for the formation of the SA SD\nregions, as shown in Figure S1. In this work, a thin Al layer of about 5 nm was sputtered on the exposed a-IGZO in the SD regions. The SD\ndoping was activated with the subsequent annealing at 200 °C for 30 min in air. The generated alumina in the contact region was then removed in the diluted TMAH before the contact electrodes deposition. As shown in Figure S1, the SD electrode was metal Mo, which usually forms a good Ohmic contact with a-IGZO layer. Electrical characteristics of the fabricated SATG a-IGZO TFTs were measured by a Keithley 4200 SCS semiconductor analyzer in the dark at 296 K.\n\n- RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nFigure 1 shows the Rsheet, average carrier concentration, and Hall mobility of the Al reaction-doped a-IGZO films versus the\n\n![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)\n\na-IGZO film thickness. It is seen that the Rsheet of the doped aIGZO films is inversely proportional to the film thickness and the values are almost within hundreds of Ω/sq. For the aIGZO films without the thin Al cover layer (not shown), the Rsheet was measured to be over 1 × 109 Ω/sq. It is also worth mentioning that the Rsheet of the ultrathin (∼5 nm) Al film itself on glass is too high to be measured. The effectiveness of metal-reaction treatment on AOS doping is thus well demonstrated. Moreover, as shown, the average carrier concentration of the doped a-IGZO films is less dependent on the film thickness, and the values are all around 1.5 × 1020 cm−3. In contrast, the average carrier concentration of undoped a-IGZO films is usually below 1 × 1014 cm−3, enormously lower than that of the doped a-IGZO films by six orders of magnitude. In addition, it is seen that the Hall mobility of the doped a-IGZO films also has a weak dependence on the film thickness and is close to 20 cm2/(V s), higher than the ∼10 cm2/(V s) value for the untreated a-IGZO.\n\nFrom the results shown in Figure 1, it can be inferred that the metal reaction-induced doping effect reach into not only the region near the surface, but also the bulk region of the aIGZO films. In other words, the doping effect is in a bulkdoping behavior. In addition, the resultant high conductance of the treated AOS films should be attributed mainly to the\n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)\n\ntremendous increase in carrier concentration during the Al reaction-doping process.\n\nTo further explore the bulk-doping behavior, we evaluated the depth profile of the generated carrier concentration by continuously thinning the thickness of the Al reaction-doped aIGZO films. That is, the Al reaction-doped thick a-IGZO films of 210 nm were repeatedly etched in dilute hydrochloric acid\n(HCL:H2O = 1:200) to get the thinned films of various thickness (shown in the inset of Figure 2a). The Rsheet and average carrier concentration of the remaining a-IGZO films were then measured after each etching step. Figure 2a shows the Rsheet and average carrier concentration values versus the residual thickness of the etched a-IGZO films from three batches. When the residual a-IGZO thickness is around 60 nm, the average carrier concentration is around 1 × 1019 cm−3, indicating that a high doping concentration is well sustained even at a depth of more than 150 nm away from the Al reaction interface. Further, based on the evolution of average carrier concentration in Figure 2a, the depth profile of the carrier concentration is approximately calculated and shown in Figure 2b. The calculation process is shown in Figure S2. The calculated values are possibly not very accurate, but serve the purpose. As shown, the carrier concentration is still around 1 ×\n1020 cm−3 even at a depth of around 140 nm, indicative of an evident bulk-conductive effect. Moreover, the carrier concentration gradually decreases along the depth direction, suggesting a thermal diffusion of the generated carriers.\n\nIn addition, the depth profiles in the undoped a-IGZO films\n\n![2_image_1.png](2_image_1.png)\n\nwere also evaluated, where the Rsheet and average carrier concentration values were always more than 1 × 109 Ω/sq and below 1 × 1014 cm−3 after each etching step (shown in Figure S3), respectively. It can thus be reasonably believed that the thinning process itself did not result in the conductance enhancement.\n\nIt was supposed in the earlier work that the metal reactioninduced doping effect derived from the metal ion substitution.23−25 For instance, Al3+ ions substitute the sites of Zn2+\nions in the Al reaction-treated a-IGZO.23−25 According to the supposition, the generated carriers should only distribute near the surface because the Al diffusion depth had been found within 10 nm.23−25 As analyzed using HRTEM and EDS\nimages in Figure 3, the diffusion of Al into a-IGZO indeed reaches a depth of about 10 nm, being well consistent with the earlier results.23−25 However, considering the bulk-doping effect verified in this work, the metal-reaction doping is unlikely a result of the dopant substitution, which usually works in crystallized semiconductor materials rather than amorphous semiconductors.32,33 As shown in Figure 3b, the broad diffuse ring in the electron diffraction pattern indicates that the IGZO film keeps its amorphous nature after the Al reaction treatment, which is also confirmed by using the XRD\nanalysis in Figure S4.\n\nWith such comprehensive experimental observations, it can be reasonably inferred that the bulk-doping effect arises from a combination of oxidation−reduction reaction27−29 and the thermal diffusion of the reaction-induced donors. The donors\n\n![3_image_0.png](3_image_0.png)\n\nare most likely the oxygen vacancies and/or metal interstitials generated in the oxidation−reduction reaction at the metal/\nAOS interface.\n\nTo verify the hypothesis, we analyzed the chemical states of critical elements in the a-IGZO films without and with Al reaction treatment by XPS, which included O 1s, In 3d, Ga 3d5/2, Zn 2p, and Al 2p signals. Figure 4a shows the O 1s spectra at the surface of untreated a-IGZO and at the Al/aIGZO interface of Al reaction-treated a-IGZO. The broad peak of O 1s is deconvoluted into two peaks centered at ∼529.9 eV (blue) and ∼531.3 eV (red), respectively associated with the lattice oxygen and the oxygen vacancy in the a-IGZO system. The area percentage of the red subpeak increases from 27 to 58% after the Al reaction treatment, indicative of dramatically increased oxygen vacancies. For In 3d signals at the Al/a-IGZO interface shown in Figure 4b, in addition to peak centers at 444.3 eV for In 3d5/2 and 451.8 eV for In 3d3/2, extra peak centers at lower binding energies can be observed that are related to metallic In interstitials. The shift toward lower binding energy of In peaks also suggests a reduction of the oxidation state of In, consistent with the increase in oxygen vacancies.34 However, no obvious change is found in Ga 3d5/2 and Zn 2p signals (not shown). Regarding Al 2p signals at the interface, only the oxidation state can be observed in the treated a-IGZO (Figure 4c). Therefore, the oxygen vacancies and In interstitials are supposed to be formed by the oxidation−reduction reaction of Al with the indium oxide of a-IGZO system, rather than with the gallium oxide or the zinc oxide, because of the most negative Gibbs free energy (ΔG)\nfor the reaction of 2Al In O Al O 2In ( 752.6 kJ/mol) 2 3 G\n200 C\n+ ⎯→ 2 3 ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯ + Δ = − °\n(1)\nThen, the reaction between Al and a-IGZO can be described as a a\n\na a\n2 Al InGaZnO Al O In GaZnO\n2 In 3 V\nm am a\ni\nx x\n2 3 12 3\nO\n+ =+\n+ +\n− −\n$\\eqref{eq:walpha}$. \nIn this process, Al seizes oxygen from the In−O bond of the aIGZO system, forming an oxygen vacancy (VO\nx ) and\nsimultaneously leaving the displaced In interstitial (Ini\nx).\nNote that the metal reaction process is accompanied by a thermal annealing process, which would enable a considerable structure reconstruction, leading to the formation of the\nnonlocalized oxygen vacancies as shallow donors, instead of the\nlocalized ones as deep donors or trap states.31,35−39 The\nionization process of the oxygen vacancies as shallow donors can be described as\nV V 2e xO O = + •• − (3)\nLike Zn interstitials,40−42 In interstitials may also act as shallow\ndonors, whose ionization process can be described as\nIn In e i\nx = +i\n- − (4)\nBy adding 3a × eq 3 and 2a × eq 4 to eq 2, eq 5 below is obtained\n\n$$\\mathbf{\\partial}+2a\\mathbf{In}_{i}^{\\bullet}+3a\\mathbf{V}_{0}^{\\bullet\\bullet}+8a\\mathbf{e}^{-}$$\n\n2 Al InGaZnO Al O In GaZnO\nm am a i a a O\n+ =+\n− −\n- •• − (5)\n\n$$-m-{\\rtimes}d$$\n$\\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{a}=0$\n$\\left(\\mathfrak{H}\\right)$. \n2 3 12 3 Thus, the large number of carriers observed in the Al reactiontreated a-IGZO films can be reasonably attributed to the oxygen vacancies and In interstitials generated during the oxidation−reduction reaction.\n\nTo further investigate the origin of the carrier generation in bulk, we performed the XPS spectra analyses at the Al/a-IGZO interface and in a-IGZO bulk. Figure 5 shows the XPS spectra of O 1s and In 3d signals at the Al/a-IGZO interface and at different depths in a-IGZO bulk. As shown in Figure 5a, the peaks related to metallic In can be observed only at the interface, suggesting a negligible In diffusion and that the oxidation−reduction reaction only happened at the interface.\n\nAs comparatively shown in Figure 5b, the area percentage of the peaks related to oxygen vacancies in the Al reaction-treated a-IGZO gradually decreases from 58 to 38% with the detection depth increasing to 150 nm, but it is still much higher than that of the a-IGZO film without Al reaction treatment (27%). Thus, it is well confirmed that a significant thermal diffusion of the generated oxygen vacancies from the interface into the a-IGZO bulk takes place, leading to the observed bulk conduction.\n\nFigure 6a, b show the schematic cross-section and the top view of the fabricated SATG a-IGZO TFT with Al reaction doped SD, respectively. Figure 6c, d show the current−voltage (I−V) characteristics of the fabricated SATG a-IGZO TFTs.\n\nThe Al reaction-treated TFT has a normal drain current in the on-state region of the transfer characteristics, and has no current crowding at low VDS in the output curves, whereas the TFT without Al reaction treatment presents a seriously suppressed drain current. This suggests that a good ohmic contact and low SD series resistance (RSD) are well realized in\n\n![4_image_0.png](4_image_0.png)\n\nFigure 5.

The width-normalized R SD ( R SDW ) was calculated to be about 10 Ω cm using transmission line method. Key parameters of the SATG a-\nIGZO TFT with Al reaction-doped SD were summarized in Table 1.\n\nFigure 7 shows the evolutions of the transfer characteristics of the Al reaction-treated SATG a-IGZO TFTs under positive www.acsami.org search.

As shown, the fabricated TFTs exhibit a trustworthy electrical stability with relatively small threshold voltage shift ( AV TH ), similar to previous reports. 28,43 This means the metal reaction method does not bring along an additional instability issue.\n\n## - Conclusion\n\nThe Al reaction-induced bulk-doping effect in the a-IGZO has been systematically investigated. It is clarified that the reaction between the Al and a-IGZO is a chemical oxidation—reduction reaction that generates oxygen vacancies and In interstitials at the interface. Both the oxygen vacancies and In interstitials are shallow donors and responsible for providing free carriers in the a-IGZO film. The In interstitials have a negligible thermal diffusion and still locate at the interface after a thermal anneal, whereas the oxygen vacancies have a rapid thermal diffusion and extend into the bulk of a-IGZO film. Therefore, it can be concluded that the bulk-doping effect of the metal reaction treatment results from the oxygen vacancies generated by an oxidation—reduction reaction at the metal/AOS interface and their rapid thermal diffusion into the AOS bulk. With the Al reaction-treated SD, the SATG a-IGZO TFT exhibited high performance, including a low R SD W of about 10 Ω cm, a decent saturation mobility of 13 cm 2 /(V s), a low off current of below 1 × 10 − 13 A, a threshold voltage of 0.5 V and a negligible hysteresis of −0.02 V. Moreover, excellent electrical stability was also achieved under PBS and NBS.\n\n## - Associated Content - Supporting Information\n\nThe Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsami.0c21123 .\n\nAdditional information about the process flow of the proposed SATG TFTs, the calculation details about the depth profile of carrier concentration, the evolutions of sheet resistance and average carrier concentration in continuously etched undoped a-IGZO, and the XRD\nimage for IGZO films without or with Al reaction treatment (PDF)\n- AUTHOR INFORMATION\n\n## Corresponding Author\n\nShengdong Zhang − School of Electronic and Computer Engineering and School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, Shenzhen 518055, China; Email: zhangsd@pku.edu.cn\n\n## Authors\n\nHuan Yang − School of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Peking University, Shenzhen 518055, China; orcid.org/ 0000-0003-4621-6010 Xiaoliang Zhou − School of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Peking University, Shenzhen 518055, China Haishi Fu − School of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Peking University, Shenzhen 518055, China Baozhu Chang − School of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Peking University, Shenzhen 518055, China Yuxin Min − School of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Peking University, Shenzhen 518055, China Hao Peng − School of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Peking University, Shenzhen 518055, China Lei Lu − School of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Peking University, Shenzhen 518055, China Complete contact information is available at: https://pubs.acs.org/10.1021/acsami.0c21123\n\n## Notes\n\nThe authors declare no competing financial interest.\n\n- ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was conducted in Shenzhen TFT and Advanced Display Lab and supported financially by National Natural Science Foundation of China under projects 61774010, and 61904006; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province under project 2019A1515011951; and Shenzhen Municipal Scienti fi c Program under projects XMHT20190201013 and JCYJ20180504165449640.\n\n- REFERENCES\n(1) Coll, M.; Fontcuberta, J.; Althammer, M.; Bibes, M.; Boschker, H.; Calleja, A.; Cheng, G.; Cuoco, M.; Dittmann, R.; Dkhil, B.; et al.\n\nTowards Oxide Electronics: a Roadmap.

        "text": "# Mobility–Stability Trade-Off In Oxide Thin-Film Transistors\n\nYu-Shien Shiah1, Kihyung Sim1, Yuhao Shi1, Katsumi Abe2, Shigenori Ueda  3, Masato Sasase1, Junghwan Kim  1 ✉ and Hideo Hosono  1,3 ✉\nThin-film transistors based on amorphous oxide semiconductors could be used to create low-cost backplane technology for large flat-panel displays. However, a trade-off between mobility and stability has limited the ability of such devices to replace current polycrystalline silicon technologies. Here we show that the sensitivity of amorphous oxide semiconductors to externally introduced impurities and defects is determined by the location of the conduction-band minimum and the relevant doping ability. Using bilayer-structured thin-film transistors, we identify the exact charge-trapping position under bias stress, which shows that the Fermi-level shift in the active layer can occur via electron donation from carbon-monoxide-related impurities. This mechanism is highly dependent on the location of the conduction-band minimum and explains why carbon-monoxide-related impurities greatly affect the stability of high-mobility indium tin zinc oxide transistors but not that of low-mobility indium gallium zinc oxide transistors. Based on these insights, we develop indium tin zinc oxide transistors with mobilities of 70 cm2 **(V s)–1**\nand low threshold voltage shifts of –0.02 V and 0.12 V under negative- and positive-bias temperature stress, respectively.\n\nAmorphous oxide semiconductors (AOSs), such as indium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO), are promising channel materials for thin-film transistors (TFTs) used in flat-panel displays due to their high mobility, good uniformity over large areas, low-temperature processability and optical transparency1. \n\nAOS-based pixel-driven devices have already been commercialized for use in small state-of-the-art displays. However, the next generation of display technologies require TFTs with an electron mobility greater than 10 cm2 (Vs)–1 that can be substantially higher in some cases. For example, super-high-vision technology, which mostly uses organic light-emitting diodes (LEDs) or quantum-dot LEDs, requires TFTs with an electron mobility higher than 40 cm2 (Vs)–1 (ref. 2). High-mobility AOSs can also be used in non-display fields, including chip input/output, image sensors and power systems3–5. \n\nFurthermore, for power systems, the intrinsic properties of AOSs such as their wide bandgap, low-temperature process and high mobility can help with high-voltage operation and reduce power dissipation with compatible on-chip processes.\n\nA range of high-mobility AOSs have already been explored. \n\nHowever, serious stability problems under bias testing have been observed in high-mobility AOSs. Negative-bias temperature stress (NBTS), positive-bias temperature stress (PBTS) and negative-bias illumination stress (NBIS) are the core tests used to evaluate the reliability of TFTs. NBTS stability tends to degrade with an increase in the field-effect mobility and this instability is highly dependent on the chemical composition of the AOS. Electron mobility significantly differs depending on conduction-band dispersion, which is mainly governed by the magnitude of spatial overlap between the post-transition metal cations6. For example, low-mobility indium gallium oxide (InGaOx; IGO) TFTs exhibit high NBTS stability, whereas high-mobility indium tin zinc oxide (InSnZnOx; ITZO) \nTFTs exhibit low NBTS stability. This mobility–stability trade-off is well known, but no scientific reasoning has been reported to explain the correlation (NBTS stabilities are compared in Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1a,b).\n\nIn this Article, we report a solution to the mobility–stability trade-off observed in AOS TFTs. We focus on the NBTS mechanism, the correlation of electronic structures with NBTS and the possible origins of NBTS. We show that (1) NBTS is due to a Fermi-level shift (change in carrier density) of the AOS itself, (2) the deep conduction-band minimum (CBM) of high-mobility AOSs prefers to accept electrons from the outside and (3) carbon monoxide (CO)-related impurities donate electrons to the CBM of AOSs at room-temperature NBTS (also referred to as NBS here). Based on this understanding, we develop ultrastable ITZO TFTs with mobilities of 70 cm2 (Vs−1).\n\n## Identification Of Nbts Mechanism Utilizing Bilayer Channels\n\nConventionally, charge trapping in the gate insulator is used as a model to explain the shift in the threshold voltage (Vth) in transistors. As illustrated in Fig. 1a, positive charges trapped at the gate-insulator interface induce electron accumulation near the gate insulator at gate voltage VG =0V. There are several candidates for the positive charges, such as holes (h+), protons (H+) and ionized oxygen vacancies (VO\n+). In fact, there have been some reports on NBTS in AOS TFTs based on this model7. However, we were doubtful whether charge trapping at the gate insulator can explain the differences in behaviours between high- and low-mobility AOSs. To validate the charge-trapping model, the following criteria should be satisfied: high-mobility AOSs must possess a higher hole density or mobility; high-mobility AOSs must possess higher hydrogens or proton conductivity; and high-mobility AOSs must possess a much smaller hole-injection barrier against the gate insulator. However, we determined that these criteria are impractical. For example, IGO and ITZO possess similar ionization potentials of ~7.2 eV, implying that both have a similar hole-injection barrier height against the gate insulator. Moreover, it was confirmed that the number of hydrogens incorporated in IGO and ITZO are fairly similar. Therefore, we excluded the charge-trapping model in the gate insulator and \n\n \n\n![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)\n\nfocused on the possibility of the Fermi-level shift or change in carrier density of the AOS itself, as illustrated in Fig. 1b.\n\nIt is well known that the carrier density is closely related to Vth in TFTs. To determine how Vth differs for different carrier densities, we performed device simulation. Figure 1c presents the simulation results, which reveal that the Vth shift (ΔVth) became significant when the carrier density was >1017 cm−3: ΔVth was –6.0V when the carrier density increased from 1×1017 to 5×1017 cm−3 and it was \n–13.5V when the carrier density increased from 1017 to 1018 cm−3. \n\nThis result implies that the NBTS phenomenon may occur if the carrier density in bulk AOS increases during the bias stress test. However, it is almost impossible to determine which model should be applied to the observed NBTS because the final transfer curves are the same irrespective of the mechanisms displayed in Fig. 1a,b. Therefore, identifying the dominant NBTS mechanism is critical to determine the origin of the trade-off.\n\nHere we propose a method to easily identify the NBTS \nmechanism. As illustrated in Fig. 2a, a bottom-gate TFT with a bilayer active-channel structure was employed. One layer was an NBTS-stable AOS, whereas the other was an NBTS-unstable AOS. We employed IGO and ITZO for this purpose, and their single-layer TFT characteristics are presented in Fig. 2b,c, respectively. The stacking order should be noted: the NBTS-stable layer \n(IGO) is adjacent to the gate insulator, and the NBTS-unstable layer \n(ITZO) is outermost from the gate insulator. This bilayer structure enables to distinguish the two NBTS mechanisms by observing the relationship between the field-effect mobility and VG. As displayed in Supplementary Fig. 2a, a key point is that IGO and ITZO exhibit fairly different tendencies in the field-effect mobility versus VG curve, owing to the very different electron mobilities \n(IGO: ~20 cm2 (Vs)–1; ITZO: ~50 cm2 (Vs)–1). Namely, we can identify which channel is open and which channel's Vth varies from the field-effect mobility versus VG curve.\n\nFigure 2d,e presents the device simulation results corresponding to the gate-insulator charge-trapping model and Fermi-level shift model, respectively. It is worth noting that the two different NBTS mechanisms result in obviously different tendencies. The gate-insulator charge-trapping model results in a parallel shift in the field-effect mobility versus VG curve, as shown in Fig. 2d. For the Fermi-level shift model, we should focus on the region of negative-differential field-effect mobility. This region is attributed to the mode shift from the bilayer channel (ITZO/IGO) to single-layer channel (IGO layer). \n\n 801 Thus, the position of the negative-differential field-effect mobility region will not change when Vth of the IGO layer is the same. \n\nConsequently, it was confirmed that the experimental data agree well with the Fermi-level shift (change in carrier density) model, as illustrated in Fig. 2e,f. This characteristic can be demonstrated by the close agreement between the observed data and superimposed plots of the single-layer IGO-based and ITZO-based device (Supplementary Fig. 2b). We believe that this bilayer TFT structure can even be extended to the identification of the PBTS or NBIS mechanism.\n\n## Electronic Structure And Carrier-Doping Ability Of Aoss\n\nBased on Fig. 2, NBTS instability was attributed to the change in the electron density of the AOS (ITZO). The next question is to determine the dominant factor controlling the mobility of AOSs. There exists a universal tendency in electronic structures and chemical composition. For AOSs, the CBM mainly consists of vacant s orbitals of metal cations. Therefore, conduction-band dispersion is highly dependent on the level of spatial overlap of the s orbitals of metal cations; cations with larger vacant s orbitals are more effective in achieving larger dispersion (small effective mass), as indicated in Fig. 3b,c. \n\nGenerally, ECBM tends to deepen with an increase in conduction-band dispersion, as demonstrated in Fig. 3a. This phenomenon explains why high-mobility AOSs consist of heavier-metal cations, such as In and Sn. Furthermore, the variation in ECBM, namely, the electron affinity, results in large differences in electrical properties, such as the carrier-doping ability8. Most AOSs have a wide bandgap of \n>2.5eV; thus, the contribution of thermally excited electrons (from the valence band) is negligible at ambient temperature, implying that only ionized donors contribute to the carrier density.\n\nTo date, several studies have proposed possible candidates for n-type dopants in AOSs, such as oxygen vacancy (VO) and hydrogens (OH− or H−)9,10. However, there have been a limited number of studies on the carrier-doping limit in AOSs. Here we would like to emphasize that the activation energy (Ea) of n-type dopants in AOSs differs depending on the chemical composition. In general, the carrier density is expressed as ne = ND exp (− Ea kT ), where ne, ND, \nEa, K and T denote carrier density, donor density, activation energy, Boltzmann constant and temperature, respectively. The carrier density significantly varies according to Ea, as indicated in Fig. 3d, even if the donor densities are the same. Evidently, ND should increase from ~6×1016 to 3×1018 cm−3 when Ea changes from 0.05 to 0.15 eV to obtain ne=1016 cm−3. Namely, the required donor densities \n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)\n\nbecome approximately 100 times different with a difference in Ea of 0.1 eV. As indicated in Fig. 3e, the Ea values depend on the chemical composition. In general, AOSs with a deep ECBM exhibit a small Ea. \n\nHowever, it has been observed that Ea is also related to the ionization potential11,12. The origin of Ea is not discussed in this paper. The most important fact is that Ea significantly varies with the chemical composition, and the necessary donor densities are different. \n\nConsequently, the difference in Ea determines the defect tolerance of AOSs to VO and H-related defects. In other words, ne in an AOS with a smaller Ea is more easily affected by VO and H-related defects.\n\nHere let us suppose that there are two AOSs with different initial values of ND: one AOS has an ND value of 1016 cm−3, whereas the other has an ND value of 1019 cm−3. In addition, VO or H-related defects of 1018 cm−3 are formed in post-processing, such as photolithography, gate insulator and passivation process. It is expected that the ND value of the AOS with initial ND of 1016 cm−3 changes to 1018 cm−3. Thus, the defect tolerance can be defined as the degree of insensitivity to foreign impurity donors. This phenomenon explains why high-mobility AOSs, such as ITZO, are sensitive to the processing environment as well as impurities. It should be noted that the high-mobility AOS itself is not a defective material.\n\nCO-related impurity in AOSs and its influence on NBTS\nAs discussed above, high-mobility AOSs, such as ITZO, have a deep ECBM with shallow donor levels (small Ea of donors); a smaller value of ND is required for AOSs with shallower donor levels and a smaller value of ND may make ITZO to become more sensitive to defects and impurities. In this context, we show that a large number of CO-related impurities were introduced after the photolithography process. The thermal desorption spectra shown in Fig. 4a,b indicate that carbon-related impurities, namely, CO and CO2, were detected only for the ITZO thin film that underwent the photolithography process, which was also confirmed by hard X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (HAXPES) (Fig. 4c–f)13. The C1s peak clearly shows the existence of C–O and C=O components; thus, the O1s peak should also be deconvoluted at least into three components: lattice oxygen, C–O and C=O (refs. 14–20). It should be noted that the O1s peak at around 532 eV has been well used for the determination of VO defects in this field21–23. This background implies that if we have not revealed the CO-related impurity, this study could have been concluded as the VO-related issue because the carbon-related O1s peak also takes the position of ~532 eV (refs. 14–20).\n\nThe amounts of both CO and CO2 were revealed to be \n~5×1015 cm−2, and Auger electron spectroscopy measurement indicated that CO-related impurities existed in the surface region (Supplementary Fig. 3). In addition, the thermal desorption spectra indicated that the CO-related impurities were not physisorbed species because the desorption temperature was high (~350 °C). Thus, the CO-related impurities were formed as a result of the chemical reaction between the oxide surface and alkali photoresist (PR). \n\n 802\n\n  \n\n![3_image_0.png](3_image_0.png)\n\n![3_image_1.png](3_image_1.png)\n\n![4_image_0.png](4_image_0.png)\n\nIt was also confirmed that the chemical reaction is not limited to a specific PR; PRs of different companies yielded the same results, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 4.\n\nBefore investigating the effect of CO-related impurities on TFTs, it was first necessary to consider how to eliminate these impurities. \n\nBased on the fact that all CO-related impurities desorb at >350 °C \n(Fig. 4a,b), we modified the conventional TFT fabrication process, as illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 5: 400 °C post-annealing was performed in the final step, which made it possible to obtain a CO-impurity-free ITZO TFT. Next, ITZO TFTs with different amounts of CO-related impurities were prepared by exposing the TFTs to PR and varying the annealing temperature. Consequently, we observed a noticeable correlation between the CO amount and NBTS instability, as illustrated in Fig. 5. It should be noted that CO-related impurity was not limited to ITZO. Almost the same number of CO-related impurities were also confirmed for conventional AOSs after the same photolithography process, as illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 6a. Nevertheless, it is interesting to note that the IGZO TFT rarely suffers from NBTS instability even if there were the same number of CO-related impurities, as illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 6b. This phenomenon was most likely due to the mobility–stability trade-off. Only the ITZO TFT suffered from serious NBS instability by CO-related impurities. We note that the NBS mechanism is based on the increase in carrier density in ITZO, implying that CO-related impurities may form donor-like states.\n\nTo clarify that the obtained NBTS stability in Fig. 5e is not attributable to the thermal annealing effect, we fabricated an impurity-free ITZO TFT by the shadow-mask process (width, W=1,000 µm; length, L=500 µm). As shown in Supplementary Fig. 7, the shadow-mask process was revealed to greatly improve the NBTS stability. This result strongly supports the correlation between the CO-related impurity and NBTS instability. On the other hand, we also found that the residual gas can be another source of CO-related impurities. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 8, a fairly large amount of CO-related impurities was confirmed for the sample deposited in the vacuum chamber with a base pressure of ~10–5Pa. This result suggests that all the possible sources of CO-related impurities should be considered for high-mobility AOS TFTs.\n\nTo further understand the role of CO-related impurities, we focused on conventional CO gas sensors based on metal oxides and noticed that there have already been many studies on the charge transfer phenomenon between metal oxides and adsorbates by Fermi-level modulation24,25. The proposed charge transfer mechanism is as follows: when the Fermi level is shifted down by gate biasing, the adsorbates donate electrons to metal oxides. There have also been many reports on gas sensors utilizing this mechanism, called gas field-effect transistors24–29. Here we considered why the CO-related impurities influence higher-mobility AOSs rather than the lower-mobility ones. The ECBM value is an important factor because electrons are transferred from the adsorbates to the conduction band of AOSs, implying that the deep ECBM enables to get electrons more readily from the adsorbates. The Wolkenstein model also suggests that charge transfer from the adsorbates is strongly governed by the Fermi level and ECBM (ref. 29).\n\nBased on conventional studies and our experimental results, Supplementary Fig. 9a,b presents the schematic of the donor-like states formed by CO-related impurities. It was supposed that the CO-related impurities formed a deep state before gate biasing since there was no difference in the carrier density of ITZO samples with and without the CO impurities. Then, a significant change in the carrier density appeared after NBS, indicating that the initial deep state was transformed into a shallow state. There have been a number of studies regarding the adsorption of CO on semiconducting oxide surfaces30–32. The different behaviours of ITZO and IGZO \nTFTs towards CO-related impurities may be explained based on the discussion above. In particular, we proposed that AOSs with large 804\n\n![5_image_0.png](5_image_0.png)\n\nEa, such as IGZO, are rarely affected by externally introduced impurities, which can be easily understood from the formula shown in Supplementary Fig. 9c; the primary factor is the location of the ECBM.\n\n## Ultrastable Itzo Tfts With High Mobility Of 70 Cm2 **(V S)–1**\n\nWe have shown that an NBS-stable ITZO TFT can be created by eliminating CO-related impurities. However, it should be noted that, in practice, TFTs are exposed to much higher stresses. In this respect, we conducted all the relevant stress tests: NBTS, PBTS and NBIS. To avoid surface-related problems, the ITZO active layer was passivated by 5-nm-thick amorphous Zn–Si–O (ZSO) \n(Supplementary Figs. 10–12). The use of ZSO (ref. 33) led to the following effects: (1) eliminating the surface states of ITZO and (2) \nfully blocking charge transfer between the ITZO layer and the outside. We also questioned what degree of mobility is practically available for AOS TFTs. Thus, we studied more In-rich ITZO, namely, In0.4Sn0.4Zn0.2Ox.\n\nConsequently, we determined that the ITZO TFT with a high mobility of ~70 cm2 (Vs)–1 meets the requirements for practical use \n(Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 2), which validates the potential of ITZO TFT as an alternative to low-temperature polysilicon. In addition, we found that PBTS is mainly caused by layers adjacent to the active layers. Simply put, when depositing the second layer, such as the passivation layer or gate insulator, onto the ITZO layer, relatively high oxygen partial pressure(PO2) is required to suppress the reduction of the ITZO layer. Here the high PO2 may form trap states attributed to excess oxygen depending on what type of passivation layer is used. As illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 13, serious PBTS instability occurred with 5-nm-thick amorphous Ga2Ox passivation layers that were readily involved in excess oxygen-related trap states34. Above all, it should be noted that the use of high PO2 for the second layer is also the reason why ITZO should maintain a small donor density (ND).\n\nCommercially, NBIS instability is not as problematic as NBTS and PBTS because it can be readily overcome by adopting 805 light-shielding layers. However, NBIS is a concern that should be resolved in the near future for fully transparent electronics. It is interesting to note that NBIS is greatly improved by applying treatment to eliminate CO-related impurities and subsequently passivating ITZO with ZSO (Supplementary Fig. 11)35–37. Also, note that the IGZO TFT discussed in a previous study exhibited a large Vth shift of –9V under the same NBIS condition38. In contrast, the ITZO TFTs in this study exhibited much better NBIS \nstability (Fig. 6c,f); a small Vth shift of −0.48V was observed for the In0.2Sn0.4Zn0.4Ox TFT. Furthermore, we attributed the relatively low NBIS stability of the In-rich ITZO TFT to its narrower optical bandgap (Supplementary Fig. 14).\n\nFurther, we compared the persistent photoconductivity of two ITZO thin films (with and without a 5-nm-thick ZSO passivation layer). As shown in Supplementary Fig. 15, the ITZO thin films were illuminated for 10min and then a time-dependent Hall measurement was conducted in darkness. Surprisingly, the ITZO thin film with ZSO exhibited almost no change in carrier density, whereas the carrier density of the ITZO thin film without ZSO increased from 2×1017 to 2×1018 cm–3, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 15a. \n\nThis result effectively explains why the ZSO-passivated ITZO TFT exhibits high NBIS stability. On the other hand, it should be noted that the 5-nm-thick ZSO does not contribute to optical absorption owing to its wide bandgap and ultrathin thickness (Supplementary Fig. 15b), indicating that the numbers of absorbed photons are almost the same for both samples. It is, thus, inferred that the photostability of ITZO is mainly governed by surface defects such as VO. Other studies have also reported that a passivation layer of Y2O3 effectively eliminates surface defects in IGZO (refs. 35–37). \n\nConsequently, this study indicates that obtaining an impurity- and defect-free surface or interface is a key factor to the stability of AOS TFTs. In this respect, d.c.-sputtering-based passivation or interlayer (between the active layer and gate insulator) may be a solution to block unintended impurities and damage from the conventional plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition process; there may be another challenge in obtaining the resistive thin films from the sputtering target applicable by the d.c. power source. Nevertheless, we think that there are many candidate materials based on the following concept: polycrystalline phase for ceramic targets exhibits high conductivity but the sputter-deposited amorphous phase is resistive.\n\nOn the other hand, many studies have used a stretched exponential function to analyse the phenomenon of bias instabilities in AOS TFTs9,39–46. This function is often used to explain the kinetics in disordered systems and expressed as follows: \nΔVth(t)=(Vth(∞)–Vth(0))×(1–exp(–t/τ)β), where Vth(∞) is the threshold voltage when time approaches infinity, Vth(0) is the initial threshold voltage, τ is a time constant and β is an energy barrier parameter39–46. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 16, we revealed that the τ and β values significantly change by eliminating the CO-related impurity: for the stable ITZO TFT, τ=2.6×104 and β=0.5; for the unstable ITZO TFT, τ=2.9×103 and β=0.7. Some studies in the literature on AOS TFTs have shown that the value of β does not change44–46. Our understanding is that β changes when the charge transfer mechanism or origin differs because β is the parameter reflecting the distribution of the energy barrier. Another study reported that β considerably differs in a ZnO-based gas sensor depending on the introduced gas species47. A high-mobility, highly stable In2O3 TFT has been recently reported, where it was shown that β differs by the difference in the Fermi levels40. On the other hand, we confirmed that ΔVth(t → ∞) is different by two orders of magnitude between the stable and unstable ITZO TFTs. For the stable ITZO TFT, ΔVth(t → ∞) was only –0.11V, whereas it was \n–16.60V for the unstable ITZO TFT. This result validates not only the effect of the CO-related impurity but also the intrinsic potential of ITZO TFTs for commercial application.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nWe have reported the origin of the mobility–stability trade-off in AOS TFTs. The electronic structures and electrical properties of a range of AOSs were examined. The bilayer-structured TFT revealed that the NBTS mechanism is mainly attributed to the Fermi-level shift in the ITZO itself. Higher-mobility AOSs tend to have a deep ECBM (that is, electron affinity), leading to large differences in the carrier-doping ability. Shallower donor levels are formed for higher-mobility AOSs. AOSs with shallow donor levels (small Ea) should have a relatively small number of donors to obtain the appropriate carrier density (~1016 cm−3) for TFTs. The variation in the required donor densities results in great differences in the defect tolerance. AOSs with a smaller initial donor density suffer more from externally introduced defects (for example, VO\n+) or impurities \n(for example, H+ or H−). CO-related impurities, which play a role of gatebias dependent donor, were shown to be the origin of NBTS \ninstability. Eliminating CO-related impurities, combined with further surface passivation, allowed us to fabricate ultrastable ITZO \nTFTs with a mobility of 70 cm2 (Vs)–1. With such devices, there may be further unknown impurities introduced during manufacturing, which could play additional roles. Nevertheless, our study has provided an insight and understanding that allows ultrastable high-mobility AOS TFTs to be fabricated.\n\n## Methods\n\nFabrication of ITZO thin flm and characterization. ITZO thin flms were deposited at room temperature via radio-frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering using 3 in. ceramic targets (In:Sn:Zn=20:40:40 and 40:40:20 at.%). Te following sputtering parameters were used: RF power, 150W; target–substrate distance, 110mm; total pressure, 0.4Pa; partial oxygen pressure, 25%. Te flm density (as shown in Supplementary Fig. 17) and flm thickness were measured by grazing-incidence X-ray refectivity spectroscopy (SmartLab, Rigaku), and the crystal structure of the ITZO flm was characterized by X-ray difraction spectroscopy (SmartLab, Rigaku). Te electrical properties of ITZO were evaluated by a.c.-feld Hall efect measurement (ResiTest8400, TOYO) in the van der Pauw confguration, and the optical bandgap and absorption coefcient of ITZO were acquired by an ultraviolet–visible spectrometer (UH4150, Hitachi). \n\nTen, 40nm ITZO flms were prepared for thermal desorption spectroscopy measurement (ESCO) and Auger electron spectroscopy (PHI 710, ULVAC-PHI). HAXPES was performed at the BL15XU undulator beamline (photon energyhν=hν 5,953.4hν eV) on 100nm ITZO flms in SPring-8. Te energy levels of conduction band minimum and valence band maximum (ECBM and EVBM) of the AOSs were determined by using the ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy, HAXPES and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy.\n\nDevice fabrication. A schematic of the fabrication method is illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 5. Bottom-gate and top-contact TFTs were fabricated on SiO2/p++-silicon substrate. The thickness of the thermally grown SiO2 was 150 nm. The sequential 20 nm ITZO layer was deposited on SiO2 by 150W RF \nmagnetron sputtering. After depositing the ITZO layer, the device was subjected to thermal annealing at 400 °C for 1 h in air. The source/drain electrodes were constructed by a 5 nm conductive ITZO layer (deposited at 0% partial oxygen pressure) and a 60 nm gold layer. The channel width and length were patterned to be 60 and 30 μm (W=300 µm and L=50 µm were used only for the devices shown in Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1), respectively, by photolithography (mask aligner MA-10, Mikasa). The lift-off process was employed for all the patterning procedures. For the NBTS, PBTS and NBIS samples, an additional ZSO (Zn:Si=80:20 at.%) layer was deposited on the device by 60W RF \nmagnetron sputtering at 25% partial oxygen pressure under 0.4 Pa at a distance of 80 mm from the target. Thermal annealing (320 °C for 1 h) was performed again to recover the damage from plasma.\n\nDevice characterization. All the devices were measured at a drain–source voltage of VDS=0.1V in a vacuum (1×10−3Pa) by using a B1500A instrument (Keysight). \n\nThe NBS conditions were set up at Vth –20V. NBTS and PBTS were measured under the following conditions: negative gate bias, Vth –20V; positive gate bias, Vth+20V; temperature, 60 °C. Illumination stress was measured under an LED \nlight source with the spectrum shown in Supplementary Fig. 14. The spectrum and illuminance of the LED were detected by a C-7000 SPECTROMASTER instrument (Sekonic). NBIS was measured under the following conditions: negative gate bias, Vth –20V; illuminance, 15,000 lx.\n\nDevice simulation. The device characteristics were calculated by a device simulator (Atlas, Silvaco). The simulation employed a configuration similar to that of the fabricated device and a mobility model with carrier density dependence48. \n\nThe following values were used in this simulation: bandgap, 3.7 eV for ITZO and 4.0 eV for IGO; electron affinity, 4.7 eV for ITZO and 4.5 eV for IGO; mobility of degenerate states, 40 cm2 (Vs)–1 for ITZO and 20 cm2 (Vs)–1 for IGO; critical carrier density, 1×1020 cm–3 for ITZO and 4×1020 cm–3 for IGO; power factor of mobility, 0.2 for ITZO and 0.5 for IGO.\n\nElectrical parameter extraction and impurity concentration. The field-effect mobility of the device was calculated by the following equation: \nμLinear = L WCoxVds gmmax, where µLinear is the linear mobility of the device; gmmax is the maximum transconductance; Cox is the unit area capacitance of the gate dielectric; Vds is the drain voltage; and W and L are the channel width and length, respectively. \n\nThe threshold voltage of the device was estimated when the threshold voltage is at the value of the following equation: WL ×10nA. To check the reliability of the device parameters, the transfer curves of TFTs with different widths and lengths and the experimentally measured capacitance of SiO2 are shown in Supplementary Fig. 18.\n\nThe total amount of CO and CO2 was acquired by multiplying an area factor by the amount of CO and CO2 contained in the reference powder (CaC2O4). The area factor was deduced by comparing the integration area under the CO and CO2 peaks between the contaminated ITZO and reference powder (CaC2O4) from the thermal desorption spectrum.\n\n## Data Availability\n\nThe datasets analysed in this study are available from the corresponding authors upon reasonable request.\n\nReceived: 15 April 2021; Accepted: 13 October 2021; Published online: 22 November 2021\n\n## References\n\n1.

OS1 enables high reliability and a small variation in the characteristics. OS2 also allows high reliability and its mobility is large enough to achieve an on-state current comparable to that obtained using lowtemperature polysilicon. \n\n## Author Keywords\n\nOxide semiconductor; IGZO; LTPS; high mobility; high onstate current; uniformity; NBTIS \n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nRecently, the number of mass-produced displays based on transistors using indium-gallium-zinc oxide (IGZO), which is an oxide semiconductor (OS), has significantly increased [1]. IGZO with In:Ga:Zn = 1:1:1 (IGZO(1:1:1)) is commonly used in mass production, and its mobility is approximately 10 cm2/Vs [2], \nwhich is approximately ten times that achieved using amorphous silicon but is only approximately 1/10 of that achieved using low-temperature polysilicon (LTPS). By increasing the mobility or on-state current obtained using IGZO to values equivalent to those achieved using LTPS, large displays with narrow bezel and high resolution equivalent to those achieved using LTPS including peripheral circuits such as a gate driver and a demultiplexer can be obtained. LTPO is a hybrid between IGZO (OS) and LTPS and achieves both narrow bezel and low frequency driving [3]. By increasing the mobility of IGZO (OS) to match that of LTPS, these features can be obtained using only IGZO, which can significantly decrease the cost. In the authors' previous study, high-mobility IGZO with In:Ga:Zn ratio = 4:2:3 (IGZO(4:2:3)) was prepared and high field-effect mobility and reliability were achieved using IGZO(4:2:3) [4–7]. Ito et al. recently reported high-mobility IGZO with a Hall mobility of 50 cm2/Vs [8]. Other highmobility materials, such as indium-tungsten oxide (IWO), \nindium-zinc-tin oxide (IZTO), and indium-gallium-zinc-tin oxide (IGZTO), were also reported [9–11]. Typically, OSs aiming at high mobilities cause a large negative bias temperature illumination stress (NBTIS) shift [8]. The authors' previous study demonstrated that the NBTIS shift is caused by oxygen vacancies (Vo) in the OS film and the nonbridging oxygen hole center (NBOHC) defects in the gate insulator (GI) [12]. For example, Vo in the OS film can be formed with the increase in the In content. This demonstrates the importance of adjusting the composition ratio of OS. The NBOHC defects in the GI film can be detected by electron spin resonance analysis only when the number of defects is significantly large, whereas they are below the lower detection limit in the case of a GI film with a quality level for field-effect transistors (FETs) suitable for practical use. Thus, our research group is developing a high-mobility OS with a smaller amount of Vo in the OS film to minimize the NBTIS shift. In this study, two novel OSs, designated as OS1 and OS2, with higher mobilities than IGZO(4:2:3) were developed. Their \n\n![0_image_0.png](0_image_0.png) characteristics are described hereafter. \n\n2. Hall Mobility Figure 1 illustrates a comparison between the Hall mobilities of IGZO(4:2:3), OS1, and OS2. The Hall mobility of OS depends on the carrier density [13]; thus, samples with equivalent carrier densities were used for comparison. Figure 1 indicates that OS1 and OS2 have high Hall mobilities compared to IGZO(4:2:3). High field-effect mobilities can be achieved using such materials with high Hall mobilities as active layers in FETs.\n\n## 3. High Mobility Os1\n\nA top-gate self-aligned (TGSA) FET was fabricated using OS1 as its active layer. On-state current measurement was conducted on the fabricated TGSA FET. Figure 2 shows a schematic crosssection of the TGSA FET. The fabricated TGSA FET had the same structure used in our previous study, in which the bottom gate electrode (GE) and the top GE have the same potential (surrounded-channel (S-channel) structure) [14], to achieve high on-state current and excellent stability. Figure 3 shows the drain current vs gate voltage (Id–Vg) curves of FETs using OS1 (channel length (L)/channel width (W) = 3/3 m, L/W = 3/50 m). The Id–Vg curves were obtained by measuring Id and Vg at 20 points in the Gen 3.5 (600 mm  720 mm) substrate plane. According to the comparison between the Id–Vg curves, the fabricated FETs exhibited normally-off characteristics and small W dependence of the threshold voltage \n(Vth). In addition, the average value and variation (3) of Vth were calculated based on the Vth values measured at 120 points \n\n![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)\n\n![1_image_1.png](1_image_1.png)\n\nin the substrate plane shown in Figure 4(a). Figures 4(b) and 4(c) show the probability distributions of Vth and the subthreshold swing (SS), respectively, measured at the same 120 points. No deviation and only a very small variation were observed in Vth and SS. In addition, the entire G3.5 substrate plane exhibited normally-off characteristics. Figure 5 shows a comparison between the on-state current of FETs using IGZO(1:1:1), IGZO(4:2:3), and OS1. The on-state current of FET using OS1 was higher than that of FET using IGZO(4:2:3) and almost three times that of FET using IGZO(1:1:1). Figure 6 shows the results of the gate bias temperature stress tests of FET using OS1. The results of the positive bias temperature stress (PBTS) and NBTIS tests indicate that FET using OS1 exhibited a very small Vth shift (0.29 V) and favorable Vth shift, respectively. This indicates that OS1 is a very promising high-mobility material.\n\n![1_image_4.png](1_image_4.png)\n\n![1_image_6.png](1_image_6.png) \n\nMeasurement conditions: Vd  0.1 V/10 V based on 20 points in the G3.5 substrate plane Ave. and 3 of Vth were calculated based on 120 points in the G3.5 substrate plane \n(a) Measurement positions in the G3.5 substrate plane\n\n![1_image_2.png](1_image_2.png)\n\n![1_image_3.png](1_image_3.png)\n\n![1_image_5.png](1_image_5.png)\n\nFigure 4.

Vth of S-channel FET with L/W = 3/3 m using \n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)\n\nOS1 in PBTS and NBTIS tests PBTS test conditions: 60C, Vg  20 V, Vd  0.1 V, 1 h NBTIS test conditions: 60C, Vg  −20 V, 10,000 lux, 1 h OSs aiming at high mobilities cause a large Vth variation in the negative direction among FETs with short L and a large NBTIS shift because of the Vo formation. Vo is mainly formed during the deposition process of GI, in which plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) is performed directly on OS. Thus, the selection of deposition conditions is crucial to the process. FETs with two types of GIs (i.e., GI condition A, which is likely to cause Vo formation in OS, and GI condition B, which is unlikely to cause Vo formation) were fabricated and their characteristics were evaluated. Figure 7 shows the Id–Vg curves and the NBTIS shifts of FETs using GI condition A and GI condition B. Under GI condition A, the initial characteristics of FET largely shifted in the negative direction, i.e., normally-on characteristics. In addition, FET exhibited a large NBTIS shift. This may be attributed to the formation of a large amount of Vo in OS1 as a result of the significant damage to the active layer during PECVD. Thus, in the case of OS1, the Id–Vg curves and the NBTIS test results largely depended on the GI deposition conditions. Therefore, favorable characteristics can be obtained by optimizing the GI deposition conditions to minimize the OS damage.\n\n![2_image_3.png](2_image_3.png)\n\n![2_image_1.png](2_image_1.png)\n\n![2_image_2.png](2_image_2.png) \n\nFigure 8. Id–Vg curves of single-gate FETs with L/W  3/3 m using OS2 as the active layer Measurement conditions: Vd  0.1 V/10 V\n(The NBTIS test was performed on FETs with L/W  3/3 m.)\n4. High Mobility OS2 This section discusses the characteristics of OS2, which has a higher mobility than OS1. As mentioned, OS2 has higher Hall mobility than OS1 (Figure 1). Figure 8 shows the Id–Vg curves of FETs, which have similar structure to that shown in Figure 2, but without the bottom GE, i.e., a single-gate structure, and use OS2 as their active layer. The curves were obtained based on the measurements at 20 points in the G3.5 substrate plane. Vth of approximately 0 V and a small in-plane variation were observed. \n\nThe field-effect mobility was approximately 60 cm2/Vs and SS \nwas very small (0.092–0.132 V/dec). Figure 9 illustrates a comparison between the Id–Vg curves of an S-channel, dual-gate FET using OS2 with a GI thickness of 150 nm and an n-channel FET using LTPS with a GI thickness of 100 nm. Both FETs have L/W = 3/3 m. The FET using OS2 exhibited an on-state current higher than that of FET using LTPS regardless of the GI thickness. The characteristics of these FETs are summarized in Table 1. These results show that OS2 significantly reduces the SS of the dual-gate FET (0.087 V/dec, which is smaller than that of the single-gate FET). Thus, FETs with high on-state current, low off-state current, excellent SS, and high in-plane uniformity can be obtained using OS2. Figure 10 shows the PBTS and NBTIS test results of FET using OS2. The PBTS and NBTIS tests indicated a small Vth shift (0.45 V) and a slightly large Vth shift, respectively. However, the FET using OS2 is considered sufficiently reliable for practical use. The large NBTIS shift observed when using OS2 may be attributed to a high likelihood of Vo formation. As in the case of FET using OS1, this problem could be solved by optimizing the GI deposition conditions. \n\n![3_image_0.png](3_image_0.png)\n\nFigure 9.

Conclusions In this study, high-mobility OS1 and OS2 were developed. OS1 introduces significantly high in-plane uniformity, small W dependence, and high mobility, and hence, it is suitable for mass production. OS2 has a higher mobility than OS1. When OS2 was used in a dual-gate FET, the fabricated FET exhibited an on-state current higher than that of FETs using LTPS. Thus, when used in practice, OS1 and OS2 are expected to achieve a narrower bezel and higher resolution than those obtained with IGZO(1:1:1). \n\n6. References \n[1] C.A.

While the device without any passivation layer showed a huge threshold voltage Vth- shift under positive gate voltage stress, the suitably passivated device did not exhibit any Vth shift.

Although high performance oxide TFTs have previously been reported,1–4 an unambiguous understanding of the dominant mechanism of the device instability is still lacking. In the case of amorphous Si TFTs, the device instability has been attributed to two different mechanisms: charge trapping in the gate dielectric or the creation of metastable danglingbond states in amorphous Si.5–8 While amorphous Si has strong covalent bonding due to its hybrid sp3 orbitals, which act as a building unit, amorphous indium-gallium-zinc oxide IGZO- material shows an ionic character due to the large difference in electronegativity between the heavy metal cations and oxygen atoms. Nevertheless, the threshold voltage Vth- instabilities of oxide transistors under gate voltage stress have mainly been attributed solely to the charge trapping at or near the oxide channel layer and gate dielectric based on the amorphous Si framework without any direct evidence for this assertion.9–12 Furthermore, no attention has been paid to the ambient effect under gate voltage stress, although none of the devices that were evaluated had any suitable passivation layer.9–12 However, because oxygen and water in the ambient atmosphere are known to affect the transistor properties, the adsorption/desorption dynamics of these molecules onto the exposed back-channel region of the oxide transistor might play an important role during bias stress.13–16 The reported device instability of oxide TFTs might be largely related to the adverse environmental effect that results from this, and thus, the possibility of the reliability of the oxide semiconductor itself being underestimated cannot be ruled out.\n\nIn this letter, we present an experiment that we conducted to closely examine the effect of the ambient atmosphere on the electric-field-induced instability of IGZO transistors. For this purpose, short channel transistors W/L\n= 25/10 m- with an organic photoacryl PA- and plasmaenhanced chemical-vapor deposition PECVD--derived SiOx film as a passivation layer were fabricated by photolithography and dry or wet etching process. It was found that oxygen is adsorbed on the IGZO surface under the positive gate voltage stress PGVS- and that is largely responsible for the observed positive Vth shift. The fabrication procedure of the IGZO transistors, which have a bottom gate structure with a passivation layer, was previously reported in detail.4 The passivation layer was on the top side of the IGZO thin film.\n\nThen, Mo source/drain electrode was deposited and patterned by dry etching.\n\nThe field-effect mobility fe- of 8.4 cm2 /V s and Ion/off ratio of -108 for the organic passivated device device A-\nwere comparable to those 10.8 cm2 /V s, -108- for the inorganic passivated device device B-, as shown in Figs. 1a- and 1b-. However, there is a dramatic difference in the subthreshold gate swing S- value of the two devices, as shown in Fig. 1d-. The S value of device B 0.62 V/decadeis superior to that 0.90 V/decade- of device A.\n\nNext, we investigated the effect of the passivation material on the bias stability of the resulting a-IGZO TFTs. The device was stressed under the following conditions: the IDS\nwas set to 10 A and the VDS was fixed at 5.1 V. The maximum stress duration was 36 000 s. Considering that a IDS of approximately 1 A is required to manifest the full white gray color in the AMOLED device,17 the applied stress current 10 A- corresponds to very severe test conditions.\n\nFigures 1a- and 1b- show the evolution of the transfer curves as a function of the applied stress time for devices A and B, respectively. It can be seen that while device A shows a change in the S value as well as a large positive Vth shift during bias stress, a parallel Vth shift to a higher gate voltage with increasing stress time without any significant change in the field-effect mobility, S, or Ion/off ratio was observed for device B. Figure 1c- shows the variations in the positive Vth shift for both devices with the stress time. Although the Vth for the device A was strongly shifted by approximately 8.1 V\na-Electronic mail: jaekyeong.jeong@samsung.com.\n\nb-Electronic mail: ygmo@samsung.com.\n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)\n\nfrom 5.5 to 13.6 V, the positive Vth shift in device B was very small 2.0 V- after a constant drain current stress of 36 000 s.\n\nThe positive Vth shift in oxide TFTs under PGVS has been explained by two models: charge trapping or defect creation.9–12 While the parallel shift in Vth without significant change in the S value during stress time is attributed to simple charge trapping in the gate dielectric and/or at the channel/dielectric interface, the positive shift in Vth accompanying the change in S comes from the creation of defects within the oxide semiconductor channel material. In addition, it has been claimed that the recovery behavior of Vth without any thermal annealing excludes the possibility of charge injection into the gate dielectric.9 In this study, because devices A and B have an identical gate dielectric and IGZO semiconductor, the charge trapping at or near the channel/dielectric interface during gate voltage stress would be expected to be similar to each other. However, the positive Vth shifts for devices A and B were 8.1 and 2.0 V, respectively. Here, we note that the Vth 5.5 V- of the pristine device A is larger than that 1.1 V- of device B. Thus, the difference in the instability of Vth between the two devices may be caused by the difference in the gate voltage initially applied to induce the 10 A drain current because the effectively large vertical electrical field for device A causes more charge trapping.12 Figure 2 shows the effect of the constant gate voltage stress on both devices. The application of identical gate voltage stress to both devices VGS= 15 V, VDS\n= 0 V, time= 3600 s- still resulted in consistent Vth instability: the positive Vth shifts for devices A and B were 3.5 and 0.42 V, respectively. Therefore, the charge trapping model alone cannot entirely account for the results obtained. To obtain more insight into the ambient effect, the bias-induced instability on the IGZO transistor without any passivation layer was examined and the results are included in Fig. 2. Interestingly, the unpassivated device exhibited an interme-\n\n![2_image_1.png](2_image_1.png) \n\ndiate Vth shift 1.62 V- after the application of PGVS for 1 h.\n\nObviously, the interaction between the active backchannel and ambient played a critical role in determining the Vth instability. It is well known that adsorbed oxygen can capture an electron from the conduction band and that the resulting oxygen species can exist in various forms such as O2−, O−, or O2−, as described by the following chemical reaction. As a result of charge transfer, a depletion layer is formed beneath the Zn-based oxide surface, leading to an increase in the Vth of the transistor,13,14\n\n## O2Gas- + E − = 2O−Solid-.\n\nThe equilibrium constant K is given by O−solid /PO2n, where O−solid, PO2, and n are the adsorbed oxygen concentration on the IGZO surface, the partial oxygen pressure, and the electron density in the channel, respectively. As pointed out in a previous report,13 an increase in PO2 results in a positive Vth shift in the resulting oxide transistor because the equilibrium constant K should be invariant at a fixed temperature, and as a result, the concentration of Osolid\n− increases. Likewise, when VGS is positive, the accumulated electron density n in the channel region increases and the resulting adsorbate concentration of Osolid\n−  is also increased, giving rise to an increase in the Vth of the transistor, which is schematically shown in Fig. 3a-. In fact, there have been several reports on the electric-field-induced adsorption or migration of molecules on polycrystalline ZnO materials.18–20 Because the electronegativities of In 1.78- and Ga 1.81- are\n\n![2_image_2.png](2_image_2.png)\n\nsimilar to that of Zn 1.65-, it is quite reasonable to expect oxygen to be adsorbed/desorbed on the surface of the IGZO\nfilm under the influence of an electric field. Therefore, the positive Vth shift in the PGVS stress should be carefully considered.\n\nBased on the above discussion, the observed experimental results can be clearly explained. The huge positive Vth shift in the unpassivated device 1.2 V, Fig. 2- resulted from the superimpositions of the Vth shifts due to the increased negatively charged-oxygen adsorption and charge trapping at the dielectric/channel layer. However, in the SiOx passivated device, the adsorption of additional oxygen from the ambient atmosphere is kinetically prevented by the diffusion barrier property of the SiOx thin film 100 nm-, thereby resulting in a much smaller Vth shift 0.42 V-.\n\nFigure 1d- shows the variations in the S value for both devices with the stress time. For device A, the subthreshold slope became rapidly steeper during initial bias stress: the S\nvalue was reduced from 0.90 to 0.49 V/decade after the application of bias stress for 3600 s. However, no such change in the S value was observed for device B. This observation also cannot be explained by the charge trapping model. Previously, we reported that the water adsorption/desorption process on the IGZO surface involves trap creation/removal in the active layer, indicating that H2O molecules can act as electron trap centers as well as electron donors on the IGZO\nsurface.14 It is expected that some of the positively charged water molecules on the surface will be desorbed upon the application of a positive gate bias, as shown in Fig. 3b-.\n\nTherefore, their desorptions would result in the simultaneous, additional positive Vth shift and decrease in the S\nvalue. This is believed to be the case for device A because the organic PA layer tends to cause the intake of moisture upon its exposure to the ambient atmosphere. Therefore, the initial rapid Vth shift and change in the S value for device A\nwere mainly attributed to the electric-field-induced water desorption. We note that the PA-passivated device showed larger Vth shift than an unpassivated device. In the case of an unpassivated device, only O2 adsorption contributes to the positive Vth shift. However, the PA-passivated device might suffer from H2O desorption as well as O2 adsorption during PGVS. Indeed, the PA layer is permeable to the diffusion of oxygen or water molecule because the diffusion barrier property for organic materials is quite poor water vapor transmission rate of 1 g/m2 day and oxygen transmission rate of 3 mL/m2 day Refs. 21 and 22-. This would be responsible for the largest Vth shift being observed in the PApassivated device, as shown in Fig. 2.\n\nOur interpretation of the origin of the Vth instability is reinforced by the observation recently reported by Levy et al.23 They found that the positive Vth shift in a ZnO TFT\nunder the application of gate voltage stress VGS= 20 V, t\n= 16 h- can be reduced from 2.4 V unpassivated device- to 0.6 V by using a 100-nm-thick Al2O3 passivation layer.\n\nHowever, they did not provide any explanation for this observation. We believe that the superior stability of the ZnO\ntransistor with the Al2O3 passivation comes from the better barrier property of Al2O3 material compared to that of PECVD-derived SiOx materials. Indeed, the IGZO transistor having a denser SiOx thin film as a passivation layer did not show any significant positive Vth shift 0.01 V- under the following conditions IDS= 10 m, VDS= 5.1 V, t= 3600 s-,\nas shown in Fig. 2.\n\nIn summary, it was shown that the positive Vth shift during PGVS comes not only from the charge trapping, but also from the dynamic interaction between the exposed backchannel and the ambient atmosphere. The contribution of the back-channel region to the huge Vth instability can be suppressed by the insertion of a proper passivation layer: The positive Vth shift during constant drain current stress was dramatically improved by passivating the IGZO backchannel with an inorganic SiOx layer. Therefore, a suitable passivation layer is essential to improve the long-term reliability of oxide TFTs.\n\n1K. Nomura, H. Ohta, A. Takagi, T. Kamiya, M. Hirano, and H.

For this purpose, short channel transistors W/L\n= 25/10 m- with an organic photoacryl PA- and plasmaenhanced chemical-vapor deposition PECVD--derived SiOx film as a passivation layer were fabricated by photolithography and dry or wet etching process. It was found that oxygen is adsorbed on the IGZO surface under the positive gate voltage stress PGVS- and that is largely responsible for the observed positive Vth shift. The fabrication procedure of the IGZO transistors, which have a bottom gate structure with a passivation layer, was previously reported in detail.4 The passivation layer was on the top side of the IGZO thin film.\n\nThen, Mo source/drain electrode was deposited and patterned by dry etching.\n\nThe field-effect mobility fe- of 8.4 cm2 /V s and Ion/off ratio of -108 for the organic passivated device device A-\nwere comparable to those 10.8 cm2 /V s, -108- for the inorganic passivated device device B-, as shown in Figs. 1a- and 1b-. However, there is a dramatic difference in the subthreshold gate swing S- value of the two devices, as shown in Fig. 1d-. The S value of device B 0.62 V/decadeis superior to that 0.90 V/decade- of device A.\n\nNext, we investigated the effect of the passivation material on the bias stability of the resulting a-IGZO TFTs. The device was stressed under the following conditions: the IDS\nwas set to 10 A and the VDS was fixed at 5.1 V. The maximum stress duration was 36 000 s. Considering that a IDS of approximately 1 A is required to manifest the full white gray color in the AMOLED device,17 the applied stress current 10 A- corresponds to very severe test conditions.\n\nFigures 1a- and 1b- show the evolution of the transfer curves as a function of the applied stress time for devices A and B, respectively. It can be seen that while device A shows a change in the S value as well as a large positive Vth shift during bias stress, a parallel Vth shift to a higher gate voltage with increasing stress time without any significant change in the field-effect mobility, S, or Ion/off ratio was observed for device B. Figure 1c- shows the variations in the positive Vth shift for both devices with the stress time. Although the Vth for the device A was strongly shifted by approximately 8.1 V\na-Electronic mail: jaekyeong.jeong@samsung.com.\n\nb-Electronic mail: ygmo@samsung.com.\n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)\n\nfrom 5.5 to 13.6 V, the positive Vth shift in device B was very small 2.0 V- after a constant drain current stress of 36 000 s.\n\nThe positive Vth shift in oxide TFTs under PGVS has been explained by two models: charge trapping or defect creation.9–12 While the parallel shift in Vth without significant change in the S value during stress time is attributed to simple charge trapping in the gate dielectric and/or at the channel/dielectric interface, the positive shift in Vth accompanying the change in S comes from the creation of defects within the oxide semiconductor channel material. In addition, it has been claimed that the recovery behavior of Vth without any thermal annealing excludes the possibility of charge injection into the gate dielectric.9 In this study, because devices A and B have an identical gate dielectric and IGZO semiconductor, the charge trapping at or near the channel/dielectric interface during gate voltage stress would be expected to be similar to each other. However, the positive Vth shifts for devices A and B were 8.1 and 2.0 V, respectively. Here, we note that the Vth 5.5 V- of the pristine device A is larger than that 1.1 V- of device B. Thus, the difference in the instability of Vth between the two devices may be caused by the difference in the gate voltage initially applied to induce the 10 A drain current because the effectively large vertical electrical field for device A causes more charge trapping.12 Figure 2 shows the effect of the constant gate voltage stress on both devices. The application of identical gate voltage stress to both devices VGS= 15 V, VDS\n= 0 V, time= 3600 s- still resulted in consistent Vth instability: the positive Vth shifts for devices A and B were 3.5 and 0.42 V, respectively. Therefore, the charge trapping model alone cannot entirely account for the results obtained. To obtain more insight into the ambient effect, the bias-induced instability on the IGZO transistor without any passivation layer was examined and the results are included in Fig. 2. Interestingly, the unpassivated device exhibited an interme-\n\n![2_image_1.png](2_image_1.png) \n\ndiate Vth shift 1.62 V- after the application of PGVS for 1 h.\n\nObviously, the interaction between the active backchannel and ambient played a critical role in determining the Vth instability. It is well known that adsorbed oxygen can capture an electron from the conduction band and that the resulting oxygen species can exist in various forms such as O2−, O−, or O2−, as described by the following chemical reaction. As a result of charge transfer, a depletion layer is formed beneath the Zn-based oxide surface, leading to an increase in the Vth of the transistor,13,14\n\n## O2Gas- + E − = 2O−Solid-.\n\nThe equilibrium constant K is given by O−solid /PO2n, where O−solid, PO2, and n are the adsorbed oxygen concentration on the IGZO surface, the partial oxygen pressure, and the electron density in the channel, respectively. As pointed out in a previous report,13 an increase in PO2 results in a positive Vth shift in the resulting oxide transistor because the equilibrium constant K should be invariant at a fixed temperature, and as a result, the concentration of Osolid\n− increases. Likewise, when VGS is positive, the accumulated electron density n in the channel region increases and the resulting adsorbate concentration of Osolid\n−  is also increased, giving rise to an increase in the Vth of the transistor, which is schematically shown in Fig. 3a-. In fact, there have been several reports on the electric-field-induced adsorption or migration of molecules on polycrystalline ZnO materials.18–20 Because the electronegativities of In 1.78- and Ga 1.81- are\n\n![2_image_2.png](2_image_2.png)\n\nsimilar to that of Zn 1.65-, it is quite reasonable to expect oxygen to be adsorbed/desorbed on the surface of the IGZO\nfilm under the influence of an electric field. Therefore, the positive Vth shift in the PGVS stress should be carefully considered.\n\nBased on the above discussion, the observed experimental results can be clearly explained. The huge positive Vth shift in the unpassivated device 1.2 V, Fig. 2- resulted from the superimpositions of the Vth shifts due to the increased negatively charged-oxygen adsorption and charge trapping at the dielectric/channel layer. However, in the SiOx passivated device, the adsorption of additional oxygen from the ambient atmosphere is kinetically prevented by the diffusion barrier property of the SiOx thin film 100 nm-, thereby resulting in a much smaller Vth shift 0.42 V-.\n\nFigure 1d- shows the variations in the S value for both devices with the stress time. For device A, the subthreshold slope became rapidly steeper during initial bias stress: the S\nvalue was reduced from 0.90 to 0.49 V/decade after the application of bias stress for 3600 s. However, no such change in the S value was observed for device B. This observation also cannot be explained by the charge trapping model. Previously, we reported that the water adsorption/desorption process on the IGZO surface involves trap creation/removal in the active layer, indicating that H2O molecules can act as electron trap centers as well as electron donors on the IGZO\nsurface.14 It is expected that some of the positively charged water molecules on the surface will be desorbed upon the application of a positive gate bias, as shown in Fig. 3b-.\n\nTherefore, their desorptions would result in the simultaneous, additional positive Vth shift and decrease in the S\nvalue. This is believed to be the case for device A because the organic PA layer tends to cause the intake of moisture upon its exposure to the ambient atmosphere. Therefore, the initial rapid Vth shift and change in the S value for device A\nwere mainly attributed to the electric-field-induced water desorption. We note that the PA-passivated device showed larger Vth shift than an unpassivated device. In the case of an unpassivated device, only O2 adsorption contributes to the positive Vth shift. However, the PA-passivated device might suffer from H2O desorption as well as O2 adsorption during PGVS. Indeed, the PA layer is permeable to the diffusion of oxygen or water molecule because the diffusion barrier property for organic materials is quite poor water vapor transmission rate of 1 g/m2 day and oxygen transmission rate of 3 mL/m2 day Refs. 21 and 22-. This would be responsible for the largest Vth shift being observed in the PApassivated device, as shown in Fig. 2.\n\nOur interpretation of the origin of the Vth instability is reinforced by the observation recently reported by Levy et al.23 They found that the positive Vth shift in a ZnO TFT\nunder the application of gate voltage stress VGS= 20 V, t\n= 16 h- can be reduced from 2.4 V unpassivated device- to 0.6 V by using a 100-nm-thick Al2O3 passivation layer.\n\nHowever, they did not provide any explanation for this observation. We believe that the superior stability of the ZnO\ntransistor with the Al2O3 passivation comes from the better barrier property of Al2O3 material compared to that of PECVD-derived SiOx materials. Indeed, the IGZO transistor having a denser SiOx thin film as a passivation layer did not show any significant positive Vth shift 0.01 V- under the following conditions IDS= 10 m, VDS= 5.1 V, t= 3600 s-,\nas shown in Fig. 2.\n\nIn summary, it was shown that the positive Vth shift during PGVS comes not only from the charge trapping, but also from the dynamic interaction between the exposed backchannel and the ambient atmosphere. The contribution of the back-channel region to the huge Vth instability can be suppressed by the insertion of a proper passivation layer: The positive Vth shift during constant drain current stress was dramatically improved by passivating the IGZO backchannel with an inorganic SiOx layer. Therefore, a suitable passivation layer is essential to improve the long-term reliability of oxide TFTs.\n\n1K. Nomura, H. Ohta, A. Takagi, T. Kamiya, M. Hirano, and H.

        "text": "# Performance Improvement Of A-Igzo Thin-Film Transistor By Using Ta2O5/Sio2 **Double-Layer Gate Dielectric**\n\nZiwen Wang*, Yonggao Hu*, Qingping Lin*, Lei Li*, Kuan-Chang Chang* \n* **School of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Peking University, Shenzhen Graduate School, Shenzhen** \n518055, China\n\n## Abstract\n\na-IGZO TFT devices are receiving great attention, not only the new display applications require higher mobility, but still need to overcome shortcomings such as high threshold voltage and high sub-threshold swing. In this work, a double-layer gate dielectric \n(Ta2O5/SiO2**) a-IGZO TFT device is proposed and compared with** \na single-layer gate dielectric (SiO2**) device. The results appeal that** \nthe mobility is effectively improved, the sub-threshold swing is reduced, the On-Off current ratio is increased, and the operating voltage is small. Comparisons of single-layer and double-layer gate dielectric structures are discussed through energy bandgap analysis. COMSOL simulations and analysis of the electric field and potential distributions of the devices are carried out to explain the reason for the performance improvement in principle. \n\nAuthor Keywords High-κ dielectric; Ta2O5**; thin film transistor (TFT); amorphous** \nindium gallium zinc oxide (a-IGZO); double-layer dielectric. \n\n1. Introduction In recent years, amorphous indium gallium zinc oxide (a-IGZO) thin-film transistors (TFT) has attracted considerable attention and become a hot spot in display filed due to its good uniformity, transparency and simple fabrication process properties, which make it meet the needs for future display applications [1]-[4]. However, since the future display applications require larger drive current, the flexible display needs miniaturization, lower power consumption, low operating voltage, and system on panel (SOP) \napplications even require fast switching speed, it is of great importance to keep improving the overall performance of a-IGZO \nTFTs. \n\nA method to effectively achieve the above requirements is to increase the gate capacitance. One way is to use high-κ gate dielectric, current research on high-κ gate dielectric TFTs [5]-[7] \nusually requires relatively thick layers, there are also problems on large leakage current and large SS value, and the direct contact between high-κ material and IGZO layer will deteriorate the mobility [8]-[9]. And another way is to reduce the thickness of the gate dielectric layer [10], however the precise thickness of the gate dielectric is very difficult to control and the mobility is still small. \n\nTherefore, in order to improve the speed, the mobility and reduce the subthreshold swing simultaneously, a structure of double-layer gate dielectric including Ta2O5 and SiO2 **layer has been proposed** in this work, which not only improves the interfacial contact, reduces the leakage current, concentrates the electric field in the channel area, but also declines the density of charge trapping states at the gate dielectric/a-IGZO interface. To see the advantages of high-κ/low-κ structure intuitively, a single layer SiO2 **gate dielectric TFT device was also fabricated under the** \nsame process for comparisons. Energy band gap analysis and COMSOL multiphysics simulations are also utilized to illustrate the principle of gate control capabilities improvements. \n\n2. Experiments Details \n\n![0_image_0.png](0_image_0.png)\n\nThe schematic diagram of the Ta2O5/SiO2**-TFT is presented in** \nFigure 1(a). The double-layer gate dielectric (Ta2O5/SiO2**-TFT)** \ndevice was manufactured under back-channel-etched (BCE) process, the specific process is as follows. The glass substrate was firstly been completely cleaned and followed by the deposition of gate electrode molybdenum (Mo) by sputtering. Then, the 40-nmthick Ta2O5 **dielectric layer was grown by magnetic sputtering** \nunder the condition of Ar:O2 **= 46:4, power of 150W, working** pressure of 0.3Pa, and the Ta2O5 **ceramic target has a purity of** \n99.99%. And another 40-nm SiO2 **dielectric layer was deposited** \nby plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) at 300 ℃. Next, the 40-nm-thick IGZO layer was deposited by DC \nsputtering, the ceramic target of IGZO has a mol ratio of In2O3:Ga2O3**:ZnO = 1:1:2 mol%, and patterned by wet etching.** \nFinally, the source and drain electrodes was forming by the deposition of Mo and patterned by lift-off process. The manufactured device owed a double-layer gate dielectric structure with respectively 40nm/40nm thick Ta2O5/SiO2**. Meanwhile, a** \nsingle-layer gate dielectric (SiO2**-TFT) device with 80-nm-thick** \nSiO2 **dielectric was also fabricated under the same procedure for** \ncomparison and all process parameters are the same. \n\nThe transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image demonstrates the double-layer gate dielectric structure shown in Figure 1(b). After the fabrication, the focused ion beam (FIB) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) have been conducted to investigate the structure of the Ta2O5/SiO2**-TFT device from the** \nhorizontal view of cross-section, it can be seen that the doublelayer structure was indeed fabricated. \n\nAll the electrical measurements were carried out by Agilent B1500A semiconductor parameter analyzer. Both the channel width (W) and channel length (L) of the devices which were compared are 20 µm, and the transfer characteristics were carried out when VDS **= 1 V. Besides, FIB and TEM were utilized to** \nanalyze the structure of the Ta2O5/SiO2**-TFT device.** \n\n## 3. Results And Discussions\n\n![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)\n\nFigure 2 explicit the electrical characteristics of the Ta2O5**/SiO**2-\nTFT and SiO2**-TFT devices. Figure 2(a) shows the transfer** \ncharacteristics of the Ta2O5/SiO2-TFT and SiO2**-TFT devices. The** \nTa2O5/SiO2**-TFT has exhibited a huge increment of On current** \ncomparing to the SiO2**-TFT devices, indicating the improvement** \nof mobility. There is also a steeper curve of the Ta2O5/SiO2**-TFT** \nwhen the device is turning on, meaning a smaller sub-threshold slope. Figure 2(b) depicts the output characteristics of both the Ta2O5/SiO2-TFT and SiO2**-TFT devices, we can see that under the** \nsame gate voltage, the output current increases by an order of magnitude. Both of them have shown that the Ta2O5/SiO2**-TFT** \nhas better performance than the SiO2**-TFT device. As for** numerical analysis [11], the field-effect mobility (μFE**) in the** \nsaturation regime can be calculated by the following formula equation (1):\n\n$$(1)$$\n (1) \n$$\\mu\\,=\\,\\frac{2\\cdot L\\Big(\\partial I_{d s}{}^{1/2}/\\partial\\,V_{g s}\\Big)^{2}}{W\\cdot C_{o x}}$$\n$$S S={\\frac{\\partial V_{g s}}{\\partial(l o g\\,I_{d s})}}|_{m a x}$$\n\nThe sub-threshold slope (SS) can be determined from Ids-Vgs curves through equation (2): \n\n$${\\mathrm{(2)}}$$\n (2) \nAnd the threshold voltage (VTH**) can be extracted from the curve** \nof square root of drain current (IDS**) versus gate source voltage** (VGS**), illustrated by following formula equation (3):** \n\n$${\\sqrt{I_{D S}}}={\\sqrt{\\frac{W}{2L}}}\\mu C_{O X}(V_{G S}-V_{T H})\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad(3)$$\n\nIn which W and L are respectively the channel width and length of the device, and VDS **means the drain source voltage. Where C**OX refers to the capacitance of the gate dielectric per unit area. \n\n| device and Ta2O5/SiO2-TFT device   |            |         |         |       |\n|------------------------------------|------------|---------|---------|-------|\n| Devices                            | On/Off     | (V/dec) | Vth (V) | µ     |\n| SS                                 |            |         |         |       |\n| Ratio                              | (cm2 /V·s) |         |         |       |\n| SiO2-TFT                           | 8(105 )    | 0.203   | -0.2    | 2.23  |\n| Ta2O5/SiO2- TFT                    | 107        | 0.147   | -0.44   | 19.24 |\n\nAfter the calculation, the comparison of the characteristics between SiO2-TFT device and Ta2O5/SiO2**-TFT device are listed** \nin Table 1. It can be clearly seen that the mobility of the Ta2O5/SiO2-TFT device is 19.24 cm2**/V·s and the mobility of** \nSiO2-TFT is just 2.23 cm2**/V·s, the mobility has increased almost** \nnine times. The On-Off current ratio of SiO2**-TFT device is 10**5, but that of Ta2O5/SiO2-TFT device is 107**, it has increased more** \nthan one decade. And the SS value of SiO2**-TFT device is 0.203** \nV/dec, when it comes to Ta2O5/SiO2**-TFT device, it has declined** \nto 0.147 V/dec. The reduction of SS value means a faster switching speed and a greater gate control ability of Ta2O5**/SiO**2-\nTFT device. \n\n![1_image_1.png](1_image_1.png)\n\nFigure 3 exhibits the energy bandgap diagrams of Ta2O5**-TFT and** \nTa2O5/SiO2**-TFT, and also illustrate the main dielectric leakage** \ncurrent conducting mechanism. Existing TFT devices generally use PECVD to grow a single layer of SiO2 **as the gate dielectric** \nlayer, which usually uses a thick thickness (>150 nm). Because SiO2 **is a low-κ material, the device cannot achieve strong gate** \ncontrol capabilities, as well as improvements of mobility. And the thick dielectric is not conducive to the miniaturization of device and the integration of the system on chip. However, if a singlelayer Ta2O5 **material is used as the gate dielectric layer, as we can** \nsee in Figure 3(a), due to the relatively narrow width of the forbidden band of Ta2O5**, electrons will easily cross the barrier of** the insulation layer, and the leakage current with ohmic conduction mechanism will appear, which causes the device to be unusable, having no switching characteristics, and showing a resistance state. The work of Zhang L [12] has directly proved the above points. In this work, a Ta2O5/SiO2 **double-layer gate** \ndielectric layer structure in the form of high-κ/low-κ has been proposed, and its energy band structure diagram is shown in Figure 3(b), combing the wider bandgap of SiO2**, leakage current** \nmechanism of the insulating layer is transformed into Schottky emission. The TFT device adopting this structure can combine the advantages of high-κ materials and the excellent insulation characteristics of SiO2 **so that the device has not only a strong** \ngate control ability, a smaller SS, larger mobility, but also a relatively small leakage current. \n\nFigure 4. **The COMSOL simulations diagrams of electric** \n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png) field and electric potential, SiO2**-TFT are respectively (a)** \nand (b), Ta2O5/SiO2**-TFT are respectively (c) and (d).** To get a better view of the gate control ability improvement, the COMSOL multiphysics simulations are carried out, which is shown in Figure 4. Figure 4(a)(c) depicts the electric field distribution of Ta2O5/SiO2-TFT and SiO2**-TFT devices, the** electric field intensity is stronger and the electric field is more concentrated in the SiO2 **layer near the IGZO conductive channel** in the double-layer gate structure. Meanwhile, the electric potential distributions are depicted in Figure 4(b)(d), the potential in Ta2O5/SiO2**-TFT near the IGZO surface channel is higher than** \nthat in the single-layer structure, indicating that more gate voltage is applied to the conductive channel region when the device is operating, which means that electrons acting as IGZO conductive carriers will be enriched in the conductive region and contributing to the huge increment of mobility. According to the simulations above, the double-layered gate structure TFT device has stronger gate control capability than the single-layer gate structure TFT device and simultaneously explained why the double-layer gate structure TFT device exhibits a larger on-state current, higher mobility and a smaller SS in electric characteristics. \n\n4. Conclusion In this paper, a TFT device with double-layer gate dielectric \n(Ta2O5/SiO2**) structure is produced using back channel etching** process, and is compared with a TFT device with a single-layer SiO2 **gate dielectric layer. The results show that the high-κ/low-κ** \ndouble-layer gate dielectric device has stronger gate control ability, faster switching speed, smaller SS value, larger On-Off current ratio, and higher device mobility than single-layer SiO2 device. This paper proposes a promising method for performance optimization of TFT device for new display applications. \n\n5.

Under positive-bias temperature**\nstress, the threshold voltage in short-channel devices was negatively shifted; this shift was attributed to hydrogen diffusion. To inhibit hydrogen migration, low-temperature high-pressure (LTHP) fluorine treatment was subsequently utilized. Under supercritical fluid states, fluorine, the most electronegative species of all elements, acted as a reactant and reduced mobile hydrogen. It was confirmed that the treatment benefited the characteristic properties of InGaZnO TFTs with varied channel lengths, especially in devices with short channels. The reliability of devices under stress improved through the LTHP treatment; the effects of suppression of hydrogen diffusion were illustrated by the energy band and capacitance–voltage curves of devices. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy of the specimen treated with LTHP indicated the presence of fluorine, which ensured the contribution of the treatment. Thus, LTHP treatment enables the realization of small-sized highperformance top-gate InGaZnO TFTs.\n\nIndex Terms**—Hydrogen diffusion, indium–gallium–zinc**\noxide (IGZO), instability mechanism, low-temperature highpressure treatment.\n\nManuscript received August 27, 2021; revised September 22, 2021; accepted September 24, 2021.

INTRODUCTION\nTHIN film transistors (TFTs) have many applications, one of which is the realization of displays on a flat panel. For years, InGaZnO (IGZO) has been a promising material for electronic appliances such as switches or driving devices [1]–[3]. As a conventional active layer material, amorphous IGZO (a-IGZO) has a mobility higher than that of a-Si [4]. Compared to low-temperature polycrystalline silicon (LTPS), IGZO is less expensive to fabricate owing to the need for fewer photo masks [5]. Additionally, because of their high mobility [3], good uniformity [4], high on/off ratio, and lower leakage [6], IGZO TFTs have become ideal candidates for fulfilling peripheral circuit design [7], [8], and flexible applications in the future [9].\n\nOwing to these outstanding characteristics and stable reliabilities, IGZO is used as the driving TFT in active matrix liquid crystal displays (AMLCDs) and active matrix organic light-emitting diodes (AMOLEDs) [10], [11]. Novel circuits can be designed using IGZO TFTs. Their versatility has been demonstrated in low-temperature poly-crystalline silicon and oxide (LPTO) devices [12]. Combining the unique properties of circuits, IGZO TFTs have promoted advancements in electronic devices [13], [14]. The self-aligned IGZO TFT is designed to reduce the size of the device to achieve better electrical characteristics. Scaling down the size of TFTs enables higher current and greater density of TFTs on the panels [15], [16]. A top-gate structure can decrease the parasitic capacitance of devices as the structure results in less gate and source/drain overlap. In addition, their contact resistance can be enhanced compared to that of conventional back-channel etching or etching stop-layer TFTs [17].\n\nHydrogen is incorporated in the gate insulator (GI) during device deposition [18]–[21]. This causes severe degradation, induced by hydrogen diffusion from GI to IGZO. Investigating these degradation effects would help in improving the reliability of self-aligned IGZO TFTs [21]. Previous researches show that during positive bias applied at the top gate, the negative threshold voltage shift in short-channel IGZO can be attributed to hydrogen diffusion [22], [23]. The hydrogen in IGZO is considered a shallow donor and results in a more\n\n![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)\n\nconductive IGZO; hence, the inhibition of hydrogen diffusion is crucial [24], [25]. Intense efforts have been made to improve the reliability of hydrogen block barriers in suppressing hydrogen [20], [26], [27]. In this work, a fluorine reactant under high pressure and low temperature was incorporated as a suppressor of hydrogen diffusion.\n\nII. EXPERIMENT AND FABRICATION\nA buffer layer composed of 50 nm-thick SiNx and 180 nm-thick SiOx was deposited on a glass substrate through chemical vapor deposition (CVD). It was dehydrated during annealing at 400 ◦C. Radio frequency (RF) sputtering of InGaZnO4 target led to the formation of an IGZO film above the buffer layer. The thickness of the IGZO active layer was 50 nm. A gate insulator of thickness 120 nm was formed through CVD, and subsequently dehydrated by annealing. The molybdenum metal gate was deposited through sputtering. After the 200 nm-thick metal gate was formed, an interlayer dielectric (ILD) layer of 300 nm thickness was deposited using CVD. During ILD formation, excess hydrogen diffused downward into the IGZO layer and later formed n+ IGZO, which made an ideal ohmic contact between the source and drain. The source and drain were sputter-deposited after the channel was formed. Subsequently, the SiNx layer was deposited by CVD to passivate the device. Finally, the device was fabricated, as shown in Fig. 1(a). The annealing process at 260 ◦ after ILD layer deposition led to the diffusion of hydrogen into IGZO and GI simultaneously. In addition to the formation of n+ IGZO, hydrogen was present in the GI layer, which indicated hydrogen diffusion from the GI to the IGZO layer. Low-temperature high-pressure (LTHP) treatment of the device was performed in a steel container with gas conveyed from a gas cylinder under a pressure higher than 2000 psi at 120 ◦C. The LTHP treatment is applied after the whole fabrication process of devices.\n\nThe device was treated by CO2 and NF3 gas, which transformed into a supercritical state and was accompanied by a chemical reaction. The cross section of the device investigated in this study is shown in Fig. 1(a) and the experimental setup for LTHP treatment is shown in Fig. 1(b). LTHP has been\n\n![1_image_1.png](1_image_1.png)\n\ninvestigated for years, and has been found to be effective in defect passivation [28], surface modification [29], and even in performance enhancement of devices [30].\n\nAll electrical measurements of the current–voltage and capacitance–voltage curves were performed using an Agilent B1500A semiconductor parameter analyzer and a Cascade EPS150TESLA microprobe station.\n\n## Iii. Result And Discussion\n\nThe characteristic curves of devices of different channel lengths, before LTHP treatment, are shown in Fig. 2. With increase in channel length, threshold voltage (VTH) of the device was closer to 0 V. The device with the shortest channel length had the most negative VTH value. VTH was defined as VG when the drain current reached 10−9 A with VD =\n0.5 V. After the LTHP treatment, the characteristic properties did not change significantly for devices with channel lengths larger than 6 µm. By contrast, the VTH of devices with shorter channel lengths shifted positively compared to that of the initial characteristic curves. A comparison of electrical properties, including VTH and subthreshold swing (S.S.),\nis shown in Fig. 2(c) and (d), respectively. The S.S. is defined as ∂VG/∂log10(ID), with ID ranging from 10−11 to 10−9A.\n\nThe VTH and SS were extracted from 15 samples for each device, and the data are shown in a box plot. VTH and S.S.\n\nwere improved for all devices irrespective of channel lengths. However, there were significant differences for devices with shorter channel lengths after LTHP treatment.\n\nFigure 3(a) illustrates the characteristic curves of channel length 8 µm during a positive bias temperature stress (PBTS)\nfor 3600 s. The device was stressed under an applied voltage of 30 V to the gate electrode and source and drain was grounded at 0 V. The chuck for measurement is held at 70 ◦C. The result showed that there was no degradation for the device with channel length 8 µm. However, the device with 4 µm channel length showed severe electrical degradation with a negative VTH shift during PBTS stress, as shown in Fig. 3(b). The large VTH shift indicated the influence of hydrogen diffusion from the GI layer to the IGZO layer.\n\n![2_image_1.png](2_image_1.png)\n\nIn Fig. 3(c), the shift in VTH was suppressed because of the chemical reaction during treatment.\n\nTo confirm the incorporation of fluoride in the GI layer, a specimen composed of CVD-deposited SiOx/Si was fabricated and examined by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy\n(EDS). The results are presented in Fig. 3(d). The peak at 0.67 eV indicates the existence of fluorine in SiOx after LTHP\ntreatment. The decrease in the diffusion of hydrogen into IGZO was attributed to fluorine in SiOx. The hydrogen diffuses from ILD into GI during post-ILD- deposition annealing, as shown in Fig. 4(a). The hydrogen diffusing from ILD into GI results in higher concentration of hydrogen at GI terminals. During PBTS, the hydrogen in terminals of GI diffuses into IGZO channel due to vertical electric filed. Therefore, two ends of IGZO channel are affected more significantly by hydrogen diffusion. Figure 4(b) illustrates the hydrogen diffusion in long-channel length and short-channel length devices, respectively.\n\nAs the hydrogen in IGZO forms electrons and positive ions [32], which raises the Fermi level, the energy band barrier decreases gradually from the center of the channel, which is less likely to be influenced by diffusion of hydrogen [25], [33]. The capacitance curves are shown in Fig. 4(c) and (d) for the long-channel length and short-channel length devices, respectively. The increase in capacitance indicated a lowering of the barrier of channel terminals, resulting in parasitic capacitance. For the long-channel length device, the lowering effect did not affect the central energy band, as shown in Fig. 4(e). However, a significant lowering of the central energy band in the short-channel length device can be seen after PBTS in Fig. 4(f). The negative shift in the capacitance corresponded to this lowering of central barrier. As the central energy barrier decreased, the accumulation of carriers in IGZO became easier, resulting in a smaller VTH. After LTHP treatment, the lowering of the energy band decreased as the diffusion of hydrogen became less likely. The lowering of the central energy band was successfully eliminated. The capacitance curve showed no shift for short-channel length devices after treatment.\n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)\n\nDiffusion of hydrogen in short-channel length devices severely degrades the electrical characteristics of IGZO\nTFTs [33]. A negative VTH shift was observed, which was attributed to the donor-like hydrogen diffused from the gate insulator to the IGZO layer under PBTS stress. Here, fluoride in SiOx under LTHP treatment suppressed hydrogen diffusion.\n\nFurther, EDS confirmed fluorine incorporation through the treatment. The suppression of hydrogen diffusion under PBTS stress conditions is of great significance for short-channel length devices because of the need of larger on/off current ratios, faster switching rates, and greater reliabilities. Reduction of band barrier lowering attributed to hydrogen migration, improvement in VTH, and capacitance were in accordance with the suppression of hydrogen diffusion through LTHP treatment. Therefore, LTHP treatment can truly improve the stability of IGZO TFTs.\n\n## Iv. Conclusion\n\nDuring PBTS, the vertical electric field have the hydrogen diffused and migrated from GI to IGZO channel. The positively charged hydrogen ion was responsible for low energy barrier, resulting in the accumulation of carriers in the active layer for negative VTH. Therefore, hydrogen diffusion in short channel length device has induced severe degradation. In this work, a low-temperature high-pressure treatment was applied with fluorine as a reactant to suppress the diffusion of mobile hydrogen. The fluorine in GI has decreased the mobile hydrogen, leading to enhancement of electrical performance. The stability of relatively short-channel devices improved significantly. Reliability issues were solved, and therefore, faster switching rate and larger on/off current can be achieved owing to the advantages of short-channel devices.\n\n## References\n\n[1] H.

Although the device performance of metal oxide thin film transistors (TFTs) has been substantially improved, the device reliability against external light and gate bias stress remains a critical issue. This paper provides a literature review of light-induced gate bias stress instability in metal oxide TFTs and explain the importance of photo-bias instability in the applications of metal oxide TFTs to optoelectronic device. The rationale of threshold voltage (Vth) instability under the negative bias illumination stress\n(NBIS) condition is discussed in detail. The charge trapping/injection model, oxygen vacancy photoionization model, and ambient interaction model are described as plausible degradation mechanisms. Finally, the possible approaches to prevent NBIS-induced Vth instability are proposed based on an understanding of the NBIS instability.\n\n## I. Introduction\n\nAll display devices, such as mobile phones, note book personal computers, monitors, and televisions, are driven by optoelectronics including active matrix liquid crystal displays (AMLCDs) and active matrix organic light emitting diodes (AMOLEDs) display. The brightness of each pixel in these AM displays is controlled by the thin film transistor (TFT) in a unit pixel. The next generation AM displays require a larger size (.60 inch), high resolution (.200 pixels per inch), and high frame rate\n(.120 Hz). Therefore, the allowed charging time per unit frame is decreasing continuously. For example, the charging time is ;7 ls for TFT-LCD with a full high-definition\n(resolution: 1920  1080) and frame rate of 120 Hz.\n\nNevertheless, a much smaller time of ;1.2 ls is needed to drive the same-sized TFT-LCD panel with an ultradefinition (resolution: 3840  2160) and frame rate of 240 Hz. Therefore, the speed of TFTs should be increased substantially from ;0.5 cm2/Vs to .5 cm2/Vs.1 The most popular backplane technology is amorphous silicon (a-Si)\nTFTs, which is a well-established proven technology in the LCD industry. This technology offers good substrate scalability up to generation 10 (glass substrate size:\n2880  3130 mm2) and a low-cost process because it does not require crystallization and ion-doping processes.\n\nFurthermore, its amorphous nature ensures excellent uniformity of the device performance including fieldeffect mobility and threshold voltage. On the other hand, the detrimental problem is its low mobility (;1 cm2/Vs),\nwhich makes it difficult to drive the next generation high performance AM-LCD and AM-OLED backplanes with a large size, high solution, and high frame rate. Furthermore, bias thermal stress (BTS)-induced instability has been a great concern for a long time. The threshold voltage of an a-Si TFT is displaced significantly under constant drain current stress or gate bias stress conditions due to either charge trapping into the underlying SiNx gate dielectric or weak bonding break-up of silicon and hydrogen in a a-Si thin film.2–4 This gives rise to image burnout or serious image sticking in AMOLED displays. Therefore, it is difficult to use a-Si TFTs as a backplane for AMOLED\ndisplays.\n\nIn contrast, low-temperature polycrystalline-Si (LTPS)\nTFTs exhibit high mobility (.80 cm2/Vs) and excellent device stability.5–7 The key processes in fabricating LTPS TFTs are the crystallization methods that convert a-Si into polycrystalline Si and ion doping for the formation of source/drain ohmic contact. The crystallization of an a-Si film is performed using an excimer laser with wave length of 308 nm.8 This process has already been used in the mass production of small size AMOLED displays. Excimer laser crystallization (ELC), however, has a narrow process window as well as high initial investment and maintenance costs. Moreover, the limitations in the laser-beam length and laser-beam instability are a major obstacle in the use of ELC on large-sized glass: the largest equipment available is applicable to Gen. 5.5 (a mother glass size of 1300  1500 mm2). The limitation of the substrate size as well as the expensive crystallization and doping process is still a hindrance to the adoption of LTPS TFTs into the advanced AMLCD and AMOLED displays.\n\nIn this regard, metal oxide TFT technology has attracted considerable attention because of its high mobility, low temperature capability, good transparency to visible light, and relatively low fabrication cost. The high fabrication cost of poly-Si TFTs can be alleviated by replacing them with metal oxide TFTs because oxide TFTs can be fabricated without intentional crystallization and doping processes. For this reason, metal oxide TFTs have been studied intensively as an alternative to a-Si TFTs for use in advanced AM displays. Several review papers described the advantages and recent advances of metal oxide TFTs.9–12 Nomura et al.13 explored a new class of amorphous oxide semiconductors based on InGaZnO\n(IGZO) and reported that high performance transistors\n(lFE ; 8.3 cm2/Vs) can be fabricated using IGZO thin films deposited at low temperatures, even at room temperature. This report generated significant worldwide interest in high-end AMLCD and AMOLED technology, both in industry and academia because of the aforementioned intriguing features. The origin of the high mobility, even in the amorphous state, was attributed to the unique conduction band nature of this material, where the spherical symmetry of the 5s orbital makes structural disordering no longer critical. This is in strong contrast to silicon semiconductors, in which the mobility decreases significantly\n(from 600 to 1 cm2/Vs) when the phase transforms from the crystalline to amorphous state. The other important design concept of IGZO is that the incorporated Ga ions act as carrier suppressors of the IZO conducting oxide and network stabilizer.14 Since then, progress in the device performance of IGZO TFTs has accelerated via the optimization of the cation composition,15,16 the use of large area scalable gate insulator materials, such as SiNx or SiO2, 17,18 and the development of a novel device architecture.19–21 As a result of these efforts, many prototype IGZO TFT-driven AM displays have been reported, including 40 full-color e-Paper,22 12.10 WXGA AMOLEDs,18 150 XGA AMLCDs,23 and 550 fullHD AMOLED.24 The other potential application of ZnO-based TFTs reported is transparent electronics, such as smart windows, due to the transparency of the semiconducting channel layer to visible light (Eg . 3.1 eV). The experimental data, however, suggests that the input and output characteristics of oxide TFTs are affected strongly by the irradiation of light under gate bias stress conditions.25 Indeed, the lightinduced gate bias instability of metal oxide TFTs is a considerable hindrance to their commercialization into optoelectronic devices. In particular, the light-induced gate bias instability of metal oxide TFTs is more severe due to the abundance of blue or ultraviolet regions of back light units for applications to TFT-LCD panels, which have the largest market volume among the various AM displays. The stability of oxide TFTs against backlight exposure should be guaranteed for this purpose.\n\nThis paper examines the issue of photo-bias instability comprehensively. The importance of negative bias illumination stress (NBIS) instability is explained based on the optoelectronics applications. The three types of degradation mechanisms including the carrier trapping model, oxygen vacancy photoionization model, and ambient interaction model are addressed under NBIS conditions. It is noted that both carrier trapping and oxygen vacancy photoionization mechanisms involve the bulk effect in the channel layer and gate insulator, whereas the ambient interaction mechanism is relevant to the surface effect of the channel layer. Based on an understanding of NBIS\ninstability, several approaches to prevent the NBIS instability of metal oxide TFTS are proposed.\n\n## Ii. Degradation Model Of Nbis Instability A. What Is Nbis-Induced Instability?\n\nAll optoelectronic devices are basically comprised of TFT arrays (back-plane) and display mode (front-plane).\n\nFigure 1(a) shows a schematic cross-section of TFT-LCD\ndisplays. Because a LCD display is nonemissive, it requires a back light unit, such as cold cathode fluorescent lamp and light-emitting diode. This intense light always illuminates the TFT backplane. Each TFT in a single sub-pixel acts as a switching device, which supplies the information signal to the storage capacitor [Fig. 1(b)]. The charges stored in the storage capacitor modulate the transmittance of liquid crystals during a frame time. Amorphous silicon films have been used as the channel layer in the case of conventional TFT-LCD displays. The light shielding structure has been adopted in TFT-LCD displays due to the large photoconductivity of a-Si film. Therefore, most of the strong illumination can be blocked by the metal gate electrode beneath the a-Si channel layer. On the other hand, a small portion of back light (,5%) can still be transmitted by lateral refraction via the gate insulator and passivation layer.\n\nTherefore, the photon-induced instability should be controlled carefully to meet the specifications of the TFT-LCD\ndisplay. Simultaneously, each pixel transistor is subjected to continuous AC pulse stress. Figure 1(c) shows the typical timing diagram of the driving gate voltage during a single frame duty. The typical frame rate of 60 Hz means that the pixel is addressed 60 times per second. Therefore, the duty time of a single frame is 16.7 ms. The ratio of the turn-on time (;21 ls) to the turn-off time (;16.7 ms) during a single frame time is approximately 0.001. Therefore, the negative bias thermal stress (NBTS) instability is much more\n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)\n\nstringent than the positive bias thermal stress (PBTS)\ninstability under light illumination. This light-induced bias instability is also important for AMOLEDs and flexible displays because transmissive (OLED) and reflective\n(E-paper) display devices are adversely affected by the self-emitting light and ambient sunlight, respectively.\n\n## B. Photoinduced Bti Instability\n\nThe dark gate bias stress instability has been investigated extensively. Jeong26 published a review paper.\n\nNevertheless, the effect of dark gate BTS on the degradation of metal oxide TFTs should be understood clearly before studying the light-induced BTS instability. The threshold voltage of oxide TFTs is displaced positively during the application of PBTS.27,28Because as-grown metal oxide semiconductors are generally n-type, the application of a positive voltage to the gate electrode accumulates the majority electron carriers at the gate/channel interface region.\n\nThis positive Vth displacement can be attributed to either the trapping of electron carriers27 or injection28 into the bulk film of gate insulator. Here, the interfacial states or channel bulk trap sites provide possible trapping sites for any type of carrier. On the other hand, the negative shift in Vth under NBTS conditions is more subtle. Obviously, the negative Vth shift cannot be justified by electron trapping at the channel/\ngate insulator interface because electron trapping results in a positive Vth shift. Therefore, the negative Vth shift can be assumed to originate from the hole carrier trapping at the channel/gate insulator and/or injection into the gate dielectric bulk film, where the inversed hole carrier is caused by the applied negative gate voltage stress. Nevertheless, the number of hole carriers in the NBTS condition would be extremely small because there is a huge sub-gap density of states (1020/cm3) near the valence band of the IGZO film.29 Given that the magnitude of the negative voltage range is less than 30 V and the gate insulator capacitance is approximately 17 nF/cm2 (e.g., 200-nm-thick SiO2), the number of positive carriers in the channel can be estimated to be\n;3.2  1013/cm2. Assuming that the channel thickness is around 50 nm, the maximum hole trapping sites due to the huge sub-gap states near the valence band of IGZO film would be approximately 5  1014/cm2. Therefore, the number of gate voltage-induced hole carriers would be less than that of hole trapping sites due to one order of magnitude larger number of gap states. This simple calculation suggests that in the dark NBTS condition, the negative Vth shift cannot originate from hole carrier trapping. For this reason, the de-population of donor-like traps was suggested to explain the NBTS-induced negative Vth shift.30 One possibility would be that a neutral oxygen vacancy defect accepts a hole carrier to form a positive oxygen vacancy defect where an oxygen vacancy acts as a donor-like trap.\n\nThe first NBIS instability was reported for ZnO\n\n![3_image_0.png](3_image_0.png)\n\nTFTs.25 The Vth value of oxide TFTs was shifted slightly to the positive (negative) direction under dark PBTS\n(NBTS) conditions, as shown in Figs. 2(a) and 2(c). This instability was attributed to either the trapping of charge carriers or injection into the gate insulator bulk film. Here, the possibility of defect creation in the channel region can be excluded because there is no degradation of the subthreshold gate swing for the transfer characteristics during BTS duration. This anomalous behavior was observed for light-illuminated devices under BTS conditions. Although a positive bias illumination stress (PBIS) does not give rise to a shift in the Vth value, the huge negative displacement of the transfer characteristics occurs under NBIS conditions, as shown in Figs. 2(b) and 2(d). The trapping of photoinduced hole carriers at the channel/gate insulator was used to explain the severe NBIS instability. On the other hand, the microscopic mechanism was not discussed in detail.\n\nThe reason for this asymmetric polarity dependence of the bias illumination stress-induced instability should be discussed. Figures 3(a) and 3(c) show a plausible band diagram of the metal/insulator/semiconductor (MIS) structure under PBTS conditions along with the corresponding charge distribution, respectively. In the case of the PBTS\ncondition, the MIS structure becomes a simple capacitor because the majority of electron carrier is accumulated in the channel region. The very thin accumulated electrons\n(less than several nanometers) screen the electric field from the gate electrode. Therefore, there is a negligible electric field in the bulk oxide semiconductor region.\n\nSuppose that electron–hole (e–h) pairs via the band-toband transition are created by photon excitation. These excessive e–h pairs begin to recombine rapidly because they remain in the same channel region after turning off the PBIS. Therefore, the effect of light illumination would be insignificant. On the other hand, the application of NBTS to the gate electrode results in full depletion of the channel layer, which results in a nonnegligible electric field in the channel region, as shown in Figs. 3(b) and 3(d).\n\nTherefore, the photoinduced e–h pairs will be separated by the existing internal electric field. This is similar to the creation of a photocurrent by the depletion layer in a photovoltaic cell.31 Here, the hole carriers generated by\n\n![4_image_0.png](4_image_0.png)\n\nphotoexcitation are attracted to the interface of the channel layer and gate dielectric layer due to the negative bias at the gate electrode. These hole carriers are likely to be trapped at the interfacial trap sites or are injected into the underlying gate dielectric layer, leading to a more enhanced negative Vth shift compared to that under only dark NBTS\nconditions, as shown in Fig. 4(a). The basic assumption is that the irradiated photon energy is larger than the energy band gap of oxide semiconductor materials so that the photoexcitation of electron in the valence band to the conduction band is possible. On the other hand, although the sub-band gap photon (hl , Eg) is illuminated on oxide TFTs, NBIS instability is still observed.32,33 This suggests\n\n![4_image_1.png](4_image_1.png)\n\nthat a defect center in the forbidden band gap plays an important role in determining the overall Vth instability.\n\nThis defect center can be an oxygen vacancy defect, zinc interstitial, or hydrogen-related complex. Unfortunately, direct evidence showing which defect species is responsible for NBIS instability has not been provided, even though the identification is scientifically and technologically important. Among the range of defects, the NBIS instability is frequently attributed to oxygen vacancy defects, as shown in Fig. 4(b).34,35 An alternative explanation can be based on the photo-desorption of oxygen molecules or moisture on the back surface of the oxide channel in the case of an unpassivated device.36 The following three types of degradation mechanisms are discussed in detail.\n\nIn the case of a-Si, prolonged light illumination reduces the conductivity of the a-Si thin film, which can be attributed to the formation of a metastable deep-level defect\n(known as the Staebler–Wronski effect).37,38 Therefore, a-Si TFTs under light illumination would be affected adversely by stretching-out the subthreshold drain current. Simultaneously, a-Si TFTs suffer from a severe photo-leakage current, which originates from the excessive e–h carriers created by the smaller band-gap of ;1.7 eV during light illumination.39 On the other hand, light irradiation into metal oxide TFTs normally accompanies a huge negative shift in the threshold voltage without significant degradation of the subthreshold gate swing, which suggests that the photoinduced carrier generation center is rather deep so that the Fermi level can never reach the defect levels responsible during transistor operation. Moreover, the photo-leakage current of metal oxide TFTs is much smaller than that of a-Si TFTs because the number of the e–h pairs generated via a band-to-band transition would be negligible compared to that of a-Si film due to the large band-gap of the a-IGZO film\n(;3.2 eV).40\n\n## C. Carrier Trapping Or Injection Model\n\nThe dark BTS instability of metal oxide TFTs is often attributed to a carrier trapping or injection model. The application of PBTS to metal oxide TFTs causes positive displacement of the Vth value. The Vth instability due to carrier trapping phenomenon depends strongly on the density of interfacial traps (Nit) or channel bulk trapping states. Moon et al.41 reported that the SiOxNy layer can be a good way of achieving better BTS stability compared to the SiNx gate insulator. They converted the surface of the SiNx gate insulator to a SiOxNy interfacial layer by an oxygen plasma treatment. Therefore, the PBTS instability of IGZO\nTFTs can be strongly suppressed for the oxygen plasmatreated device, which suggests that Nit of SiOxNy/IGZO is lower than that of SiOxNy/IGZO. An alternative explanation is that the conduction band-offset (electron barrier height) for SiOxNy/IGZO is higher than that of SiNx/IGZO due to the larger band-gap of SiOxNy. This is consistent with a carrier trapping mechanism.\n\nThe effect of the gate insulator materials on the photobias instability of metal oxide TFTs can be explained well by a carrier trapping/injection mechanism because the interface states and band-offset value depend strongly on the material properties of the gate insulator. Figures 5(a)\nand 5(b) show the time evolution of the transfer curves for the SiN x -gated device and SiO 2 -gated IGZO TFTs, as a function of the NBIS time, respectively. 42 The N it (8.9 × 10 11 /cm 2 ) of the SiN x -gate device was approximately 3 times higher than that (3.0 x 10 11 /cm 2 ) of SiO 2 -gated device, which was approximated from the subthreshold gate swing values from both devices. 43 The inferior stability of the nitride device was manifested more clearly under NBIS conditions. Although the V th value for SiN x -gated device was shifted significantly in the negative direction (by 11.6 V), the SiO 2 -gated device exhibited V th movement of only −0.78 V.  The consistent inferior stability of the IGZO TFTs with the SiN x gate dielectric is believed to originate from its high N it value, which concurs with the trapping mechanism of the photoinduced hole carriers. On the other hand, it is not obvious that the approximate 14-fold increase in the amount of the V th movement in the SiN x -gated device (SiN x -gated device:\n\n![5_image_0.png](5_image_0.png)\n\nAVth = -11.6 V, SiO2-gated device: AVth = -0.78 V)\nunder NBIS conditions can be attributed entirely to the approximately three times higher N it of the SiN x -gated device. Indeed, the hole carriers near the channel region feel the hole potential barrier (i.e., valence band offset) at the interface between the gate dielectric and channel layer.\n\nFigures 5(c) and 5(d) show the energy band diagram for the SiN x /IGZO, and SiO 2 /IGZO structure, respectively, based on the result of the valence band profile obtained. Here, it was assumed that the band gap of SiN x and SiO 2 were 5.1 and 8.8 eV, respectively. 44 The SiN 2 /IGZO\ninterface has no hole barrier, whereas a significant hole barrier of ~2.4 eV exists at the interface for the SiO2/IGZO structure. 33 Therefore, the photo-created hole carriers can be injected easily into the SiN x gate dielectric due to the absence of a hole energy barrier, suggesting that the trapping and injection of photoinduced hole carriers are responsible for the inferior NBIS\nstability of the SiN x -gated device compared to the SiO 2 -gated device.\n\n## D. Oxygen Vacancy Model\n\nAn entirely different model involves oxygen vacancy defects. In the case of moderately n-type doped ZnO, the formation energy of a neutral oxygen vacancy defect\n(V O ) state is lower than those of single [V O ] and double ionized oxygen vacancy defect [ V 2 + ] state according to the results of the first principles calculations, as shown in Fig. 6. 45 47 Therefore, the neutral (Vo) state among the\n\n![5_image_1.png](5_image_1.png)\n\nhttp://journals.cambridge.org various oxygen vacancy states is thermodynamically favorable. On the other hand, the formation energies of oxygen vacancy defects depend on the position of the Fermi energy\n(EF) level. For example, the transition from VO to V2þO state, e(21/0), is located ;1 eV below the conduction band minimum (CBM). This means that the neutral oxygen vacancy is a nonconducting deep state when the EF is near the CBM. In contrast, the V2þO state is preferred to the VO\nstate due to its low formation energy when EF is near the VBM. This corresponds to the application of NBS to TFTs because the quasi-EF level near the channel interface moves downward due to upward band bending. Therefore, the negative Vth shift of metal oxide TFTs under dark NBS conditions can be attributed to an EF-driven transition from VO to V2þO . Here, the single ionized state was not considered due to thermodynamic instability, which is known as a negative-U center. Similarly, light excitation can cause a transition of the VO ground state to V2þO excited states.\n\nSpontaneous outward relaxation during this photoionization makes the V2þO level a shallow state, contributing the delocalized free electrons in the conduction band (Fig. 6).\n\nThis is the reason for the negative Vth shift of the metal oxide TFTs under light illumination. The metastable V2þO states in ZnO still exist after turning off the light illumination because there is a nonnegligible thermal barrier (0.2–0.3 eV) to escape out of the V2þO state to the ground VO state. This metastable change in configuration was used to explain the persistent photoconductivity\n(PPC) observed in ZnO.48 Ghaffarzadeh et al. reported that the passivated Hf–In–Zn–O (HIZO) TFTs suffered from a significant negative shift of Vth under NBIS conditions. Moreover, slow recovery behavior was observed in terms of the Vth value on the time scale of days, which was explained based on the photoionization of VO into the V2þO state (the socalled PPC effect).30,49 Similarly, the exposure of the IGZO\nTFTs to ultraviolet light resulted in an analogous negative Vth shift, which was also attributed to the PPC effect.50 The electron structure calculation indicates that oxygen vacancies (VO) also form a deep level in IGZO, which is similar to ZnO.12,51 Therefore, an electron from a neutral deep [VO] in a multicomponent oxide system, such as IGZO, HIZO, In–\nZn–Sn–O (IZTO) etc., absorbs a photon of proper energy and is ejected into the conduction band. This negative-U\ncenter behavior was calculated for IGZO system using first principle calculations.35 Furthermore, the photoionized V2þO defect centers were claimed to act as a sub-gap state below the CBM, which caused the stretching-out of the capacitance–voltage characteristics of a-IGZO TFTs during the NBIS duration.\n\nThe NBIS-induced negative Vth shift can be explained by the V2þO state created accelerating NBIS degradation by acting as either deep hole trapping centers or n-type dopant centers in the a-IGZO TFTs.52 Therefore, the proper insertion of an ultrathin barrier layer, such as the Al2O3 into ZnO channel layer, was effective in reducing the resulting NBIS instability, where the barrier layer prevented the photo-created V2þO or photo-created hole carrier from migrating by the negative gate voltage applied during NBIS duration.53 In addition, the gate field-driven migration of V2þO through the grain boundary defects in a polycrystalline In–Zn–O (IZO) channel region toward the gate insulator/channel layer further deteriorated the NBIS instability of the resulting IZO TFTs.54 This suggests that a grain boundary-less structure is favored in terms of NBIS\nstability, given that the channel composition is identical.\n\nRecently, it was suggested that the NBIS instability originates from the creation of a bulk double donor with a shallow singly ionized [VþO] as well as the formation of deep double ionized [V2þO ], which was inferred through rigorous analysis of the current–voltage and capacitance–\nvoltage characteristics of a-IGZO TFTs with different channel thickness.55 A different viewpoint was also proposed using hybrid density functional theory.56 The hole carrier-mediated peroxide (O2 2 ) metastable defect was suggested as the origin for NBIS instability, where a peroxide defect is an analogue to the formation of a VO and O-interstitial (Oi)\npair in a ZnO crystal. The energy barrier for the recovery of an NBIS-induced Vth shift was calculated to be 0.97 eV,\nwhich is consistent with the experimental activation energy of 0.9–1.0 eV.57,58\n\n## E. Ambient Interaction Model\n\nThe possibility of oxygen photo-desorption on the back channel surface as a plausible origin of NBIS instability was reported. The ZnO-based material is quite sensitive to ambient gases, such as oxygen, moisture, and NO2, so that the ZnO-based thin film, nanowire, and bulk material are good candidate systems for sensing a range of gases.59,60 Kang et al.61 studied the dynamic effect of oxygen adsorption/desorption on the IGZO back channel surface.\n\nThe turn-off voltage (Vturn-off) of IGZO TFTs is dependent on the O2 partial pressure of the ambient: the Vturn-off was moved negatively with decreasing O2 pressure, which suggests that the adsorbed oxygen molecules deplete the electron carrier of the IGZO channel layer due to the large electron negativity of oxygen molecules. Jeong et al.62 reported the effect of the environmental ambient including oxygen on the gate bias stability of the IGZO TFTs. In addition, the oxygen adsorption was described by the following simple chemical reaction:\n\n## O2Ð Þþ Gas E ¼ O2 Ð Þ Solid :\n\nHere, the equilibrium constant K is given by the equation, [O2 ]solid/PO2 [n], where [O]sol, PO2 , and [n]\nare the adsorbed oxygen concentration on the IGZO\nsurface, oxygen partial pressure, and electron density in the channel, respectively. If PO2 is increased in a vacuum\n\n![7_image_0.png](7_image_0.png)\n\nsystem, the Vth of the resulting oxide TFT will be displaced negatively because the equilibrium constant K should be invariant at a fixed temperature. Therefore, the concentration of Osolid should decrease. This principle is also valid when PBTS is applied to oxide TFT. As a result of PBTS,\nthe electron density [n] accumulated in the channel region increases and the resultant adsorbate concentration of\n[Osolid] also increases, causing an increase in the Vth of the transistor. The model of the gate electric field-induced oxygen adsorption as a possible origin for the positive Vth shift under PBTS conditions was confirmed by an investigation of the oxygen pressure-dependent bias instability63 and the effect of various ambient atmospheres including H2, O2, and air on the positive bias instability.64 According to the result of thermal desorption spectroscopy, there are weakly bound physisorbed oxygen molecules and chemisorbed negatively charged oxygen on crystalline ZnO, where the concentration of chemisorbed oxygen does not change over the temperature range between 40 and 80 °C.65 The activation energy of O2 chemisorbed at the ZnO surface was estimated to be approximately 1.1 eV.66 Therefore, the irradiation of green light (E 5 2.2 eV) is expected to desorb the chemisorbed O2 as well as the physisorbed oxygen ion/molecules from the metal oxide surface to the ambient environment. Görrn et al.67 performed in-depth studies regarding thermodesorption and photo-desorption on the surface of the zinc thin oxide film. Yang et al.36 reported that the negative Vth shift under NBIS conditions can be explained by oxygen photo-desorption at the back surface of the channel. Figures 7(a) and 7(b) shows the time evolution of the transfer curves for unpassivated and passivated Zn–Sn–O (ZTO) TFTs under NBIS conditions. The unpassivated ZTO device showed a huge negative Vth shift of .11.5 V after applying NBIS for 104 s. In contrast, the passivated device exhibited a much smaller negative Vth shift of 0.72 V under identical conditions. This cannot be explained by the trapping or injection of photoinduced holes in the channel layer because photo-generation of the hole carrier and subsequent hole trapping or injection occur between the channel and gate dielectric layer rather than at the channel back-surface. This suggests that the NBIS instability can be related to the interaction of the back channel surface and ambient atmosphere. In the case of the unpassivated device, oxygen molecules are adsorbed on the Zn-based oxide surface. Photon exposure can cause the desorption of oxygen species (O, O2 etc), which are weakly adsorbed or chemisorbed to the back surface. This is because the binding energy between oxygen species and back channel is less than the photon energy (.2 eV). The photo-desorption of oxygen species will result in the release of free electrons into the metal oxide channel layer. The desorption of oxygen ions would cause an increase in the net free carrier density, enhancing the negative Vth shift in metal oxide TFTs.\n\n## O2 Ð Þþ Solid Hm ¼ O2Ð Þþ Gas Eð Þ Solid :\n\nFigures 7(c) and 7(d) show a schematic model of oxygen desorption by light exposure and the subsequent donation of free electrons in the conduction band. The free electron density of the channel layer due to the photodesorption of oxygen-related species under light illumination is enhanced compared to that of the dark state, which results in an adverse negative shift of Vth. Moisture exposure was found to cause an accelerated deterioration of the Vth shift under dark NBS or NBIS conditions.6869 As the humidity of the ambient increased, the Vth instability of un-encapsulated HIZO TFTs became worse, which was explained based on the hole-trapping model.68 In addition, these processes will only be possible if there is no passivation layer in the channel layer.\n\nFigure 8 shows the schematic energy band diagram to summarize the three degradation mechanisms under the application of NBIS. It should be noted that the three degradation mechanisms can be highly related. Thus, it is often difficult to distinguish the contribution of each mechanism to the overall instability. For example, some of hole carriers under the application of NBIS can come from VO mediated e–h pair creation rather than the band-to-band\n\n![8_image_0.png](8_image_0.png)\n\ntransition especially when the incident photon energy is less than the band-gap energy of the semiconducting oxide layer\n(see Fig. 8). It indicates that the hole carrier trapping process is further accelerated by the photoionization of existing VO,\nmeaning that these two degradation processes are interconnected. Likewise, the oxygen vacancy defects near the back surface can also adversely affect the ambient-related instability because they can provide the active chemisorption sites for the oxygen ion or molecules, which are discussed in Sec. III. Therefore, the accurate interpretation of the photoinduced instability requires a considerable effort.\n\n## Iii. How To Reduce The Nbis Instability\n\nSeveral approaches have been examined to suppress the NBIS instability of the metal oxide TFTs. The first approach is based on the mechanism of charge carrier trapping or injection. The use of Al2O3 or SiO2 films with a large energy band-gap as a gate insulator was reported to be effective in minimizing the NBIS instability of the resulting HIZO TFTs.70 The Vth shift by the application of NBIS is strongly dependent on the energy barrier for hole carrier between the gate insulator and HIZO channel layer, as mention earlier. In this regard, the SiNx or HfO2-gated device exhibited inferior stability against light and NBS, which were attributed to either their low energy barriers for hole injection or the higher gap-states distribution.\n\nSimilar superior reliability was observed for atomic layer deposition-derived Al2O3-gated IGZO TFTs71 and thermaloxidized TiO2-gated ZTO TFTs.72 To improve the NBIS stability of metal oxide TFTs, the control of oxygen nonstoichiometry in the metal oxide semiconductor was also attempted based on the mechanism of photoionization of oxygen vacancy defects.\n\nBecause the photoionization of VO to V2þO responsible for NBIS degradation is proportional to the concentration of preexisting VO defects in the channel layer, the intentional supply of oxygen species, such as high pressure annealing\n(HPA),34,73,74 oxygen-containing plasma treatment,75 and ozone radical treatment,76 into the oxygen deficient channel region would result in a decrease in [VO], leading to the suppression of NBIS-induced Vth instability. This group reported that the removal of the VO defect centers using intentional oxygen diffusion results in the strong suppression of NBIS instability in IGZO TFTs, as shown in Fig. 9.34 The device evaluated had a high quality SiO2 gate dielectric and a passivation layer of the SiO2 film, which were deposited by PECVD. Hence, the Vth displacement caused by the hole carrier trapping/injection and ambient interaction is relatively small compared to that by the photoionization of VO defects. Therefore, the substantial improvement in NBIS instability for the O2 HPA-treated device would come mainly from the reduction of the VO\ndefect density, which was confirmed by the result of the O1s XP spectra. The oxygen plasma treatment in terms of supplying oxygen species was also investigated for ZTO\nTFTs.75 The shift in Vth of the oxygen plasma-treated device according to the NBIS duration was reduced by ;50%\ncompared to the pristine device. Moreover, the NBIS-induced Vth shift decreased with decreasing channel thickness for the oxygen plasma-treated devices. This supports the photoionization model of VO because the number of preexisting [VO] defects is proportional to the light-illuminated channel volume. As a similar approach, the ozone treatment was also shown to reduce the oxygen deficiency concentration in the ZTO film.76 Similar to oxygen HPA and the oxygen plasma treatment, an ozone treatment can annihilate the oxygen deficiencies of the ZTO film and prevent the NBIS-induced instability of the resulting ZTO TFTs. On the other hand, the surface of the evaluated ZTO film were not encapsulated, the retarded desorption of adsorbed oxygen species was partially responsible for the improvement in NBIS stability. The ozone treatment was suggested to convert the surface adsorption species from weakly bound O2 species to highly chemisorbed OH at the surface VO site, which in turn suppresses the photo-desorption process because the chemisorbed OH species have a higher binding energy than O2 species.77 The relative contribution of the two degradation mechanisms to the overall Vth instability by the application of NBIS instability was estimated, which was accomplished by passivating the ZTO surface and excluding the ambient interaction. The contributions of the oxygenrelated photo-desorption and oxygen vacancy model to the overall Vth displacement can be approximated to be 10 6 1%\nand 90 6 1%, respectively.\n\nInstead of directly supplying oxygen species, cation doping into the ZTO system was attempted as an oxygen binder.78 The oxygen deficiency of the resulting oxide semiconductor decreased with increasing ZrO2 incorporated into the ZTO material, leading to the suppression of NBIS instability of the resulting TFTs, as shown in Fig. 10. This was attributed to the Gibbs free energies of\n\n![9_image_0.png](9_image_0.png)\n\n![9_image_1.png](9_image_1.png)\n\n(A)\nformation ( Δ G t ) for ZnO, SnO, SnO 2 , and ZrO 2 of\n−320.4, −256.7, −520.0, and −1039.7 KJ/mole, respectively, in their standard state. 79 The most negative AG f value of ZrO 2 suggests that chemical binding with respect to oxygen atoms is the strongest among Zn, Sn, and Zr cation atoms. Therefore, the introduced Zr cation would increase the formation energy of the oxygen vacancy defects during the deposition of ZTO films or postdeposition annealing, which is responsible for the lower oxygen deficiency of the ZTO film and improved NBIS stability.\n\nOn the other hand, Zr doping is performed to reduce the field effect mobility of ZTO TFTs and increase the contact resistance between the channel layer and source/drain electrode [Fig. 9(c)]. In multicomponent oxide semiconductors, the electron mobility decreases with decreasing carrier concentration, where the percolation model has been postulated as a plausible mechanism for such abnormal mobility behavior. In the percolation model, as E F increases due to electrical or/and chemical electron doping, the conduction process due to the delocalized band transport will be dominant because most of the gap states below E F\nare filled with electrons. 3,80,81 The net carrier density of the ZTZO film decreased with increasing ZrO2 content, suggesting that the incorporation of ZrO 2 also suppresses the formation of shallow oxygen vacancy defects as well as deep oxygen vacancy defects in the ZTZO film. Therefore, the addition of oxygen binders, such as ZrO 2 , into the metal oxide channel layer should be chosen carefully to secure reasonable transport properties, as well as the good photostability under NBIS conditions.\n\n![10_image_0.png](10_image_0.png)\n\nFinally, the passivation layer plays an important role in determining the NBIS instability of metal oxide TFTs, as mentioned earlier. Therefore, the effect of a passivation material on photo-bias stability of metal oxide TFTs has attracted considerable attention. Nomura et al.82 reported that the photostability of IGZO TFTs under NBTS conditions could be improved by passivating with Y2O3.\n\nAlthough the unpassivated device suffered from a negative Vth shift of 24.8 V, the Y2O3 passivated device exhibited stable behavior (DVth 5 4.4 V) after an identical NBIS\nduration. The deep defects at a depth of ;2 nm from the IGZO back surface responsible for NBIS instability were eliminated by passivation with a Y2O3 film. Park et al.\n\ncompared the effects of SiOx and SiNx passivation on the stability of HIZO TFTs under NBIS conditions.83 In terms of the diffusion barrier property, it was expected that the SiNx layer would be better than the SiO2 film. On the other hand, the unintentional in-diffusion huge hydrogen species existing in SiNx toward the IGZO channel layer causes severe deterioration under NBIS conditions. The incorporation of hydrogen into the channel layer creates hole trap centers, which accelerates the negative Vth shift under NBIS conditions. This can be attributed to the photo-desorption of incorporated hydrogen into the oxide channel layer and the subsequent migration of protons toward the gate insulator/channel interface.84 Therefore, hydrogen-free or less hydrogen containing SiOx films as a passivation layer are preferred in SiNx films.85,86\n\n## Iv. Conclusions\n\nDespite the rapid progress and many accomplishments in metal oxide TFTs, important challenges remain for their successful implementation into the next generation AMLCDs, AMOLEDs, and transparent displays. One critical issue is a precise understanding of NBIS-induced instability. This article reviewed the rationale of Vth instability for metal oxide TFTs under NBIS conditions. The charge trapping/injection model, oxygen vacancy photoionization model, and ambient interaction model were described as a plausible degradation mechanism. The degradation of Vth by the trapping (or injection) of photoinduced hole carriers at the interface (or into gate insulator bulk region)\ncan be prevented using the high quality gate insulator, such as SiO2 film with a high hole energy barrier and low gapstate bulk defect. In addition, the ambient originated instability can be suppressed by an appropriate passivation layer, which should have a low hydrogen content and good diffusion barrier properties against moisture and oxygen. On the other hand, the oxygen vacancy-related Vth instability is difficult to eliminate because it involves the intrinsic material property of the amorphous metal oxide semiconductor. If the NBIS instability is indeed inherent in amorphous transparent oxide semiconductor materials, an effective light shielding structure needs to be developed. The absorption layer for blue and ultraviolet photons should cover the metal oxide semiconductor layer because these photons adversely affect the transfer characteristics under NBS conditions. Similarly, a compensation circuit to adjust the NBIS-induced Vth instability is needed, which is essential for the realization of metal oxide transistor-driven transparent displays.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThis study was supported by a Korea Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF) grant funded by the Korean government (MEST) (Grant No.\n\n2012R1A2A2A02005854), the industrial strategic technology development program (Grant Nos. 10041808, 10041041, and 10035225) funded by MKE/KEIT and Inha University Research Grant.\n\n## References\n\n1.

The experiment showed that by changing the argon-oxygen ratio and the thickness of the active layer in anterior and posterior channels, the different electrical properties of the active layer in anterior and posterior channels could be combined to give full play to the structural advantages of the double-channel active layer. It can greatly improve the performance of IGTO/IGZO TFT devices, and its carrier mobility and current switching ratio are greatly improved. The typical parameters of IGTO/IGZO TFT \ndevices prepared under optimal conditions are: saturation mobility (μsat) of 17.25 cm2/V⋅s, switching ratio of 9.7 × 106, threshold voltage of 0.6 V. Compared with IGTO single active layer device, the maximum saturated carrier mobility μsat of IGTO/IGZO is increased by 127 %. \n\n## 1. **Introduction**\n\nAs an indispensable component of integrated display, the performance of thin film transistor determines the display quality. In order to comply with the current development trend and requirements, a TFT supporting low temperature preparation, high mobility and stronger stability must be introduced to solve the current development problems [1–3]. At present, researchers are improving the structure of TFT, improving the preparation process, and applying various active layer semiconductor materials, hoping to further enhance the properties of TFT and fully demonstrate its value and role [4,5]. Performance of traditional single-channel active layer TFT devices due to the limitation of single-layer active layer, the performance of TFT devices is not much improved [6–8]. Many researchers consider improving the active layer structure and propose the double-channel active layer structure [9]. Compared with the traditional single-channel active layer TFT device, the existing literature shows that the double-channel active layer structure can greatly improve the device performance [10–13], the carrier mobility is improved several times, the threshold voltage is close to 0 V, and the current switching ratio can be improved by several orders of magnitude [14–19]. \n\nIn this paper, on the basis of single channel IGTO TFT, the structure of the TFT is changed, and the structure of the double-channel active layer is adopted. The IGTO/IGZO TFT is prepared by DC magnetron sputtering technology. By optimizing the preparation conditions, the argon-oxygen ratio of the anterior and posterior channels and the thickness of the active layer are changed. Improve the performance of IGTO/IGZO TFT devices. The experimental results show that, compared with the single active layer IGTO TFT, the heterojunction IGTO/IGZO TFT has stronger electrical modulation effect, better electrical performance and significantly improved carrier mobility. \n\n## * Corresponding Author.\n\nE-mail address: zlei@uestc.edu.cn (L.

In this study, the preparation methods are as follows: \n(1) Single layer IGTO film: The IGTO layer was deposited on SiO2(100 nm) and p + -si substrate by DC magnetron sputtering system at room temperature. In this study, the DC sputtering process is as follows: sputtering power, sputtering pressure are 180 W and 2mtor, respectively. Ar and O2 gases exist in the whole sputtering system, and 60:20, 65:20, 70:20, 75:20 and 80:20 are set respectively to carry out the experiment. \n\n(2) Double-layer IGTO/IGZO TFT: In order to explore the influence of argon-oxygen ratio and thickness in anterior channel, comparative tests were set respectively: (I) In order to explore the influence of argon-oxygen ratio in anterior channel, the argon-oxygen ratio in posterior channel is 70:20 and 20:16, and the argon-oxygen ratio in anterior channel is 16:0, 16:2,16:4, 16:6 for the same sputtering, 10 nm in anterior channel and 50 nm in posterior channel. (II) In order to explore the influence of argon-oxygen ratio in the posterior channel, the argon-oxygen ratio in the anterior channel is 16:2, and the argon-oxygen ratio in the posterior channel is 20:12, 20:14, 20:16, 20:18, and the same sputtering is performed, 10 nm in the anterior channel and 50 nm in the posterior channel. (III) In order to explore the influence of the thickness of the anterior channel layer, under the conditions of the anterior channel argon-oxygen ratio of 16:2, the posterior channel argon-oxygen ratio of 65:20 and the thickness of 50 nm, the anterior channel layer was sputtered with the thickness of 8 nm, 10 nm, 12 nm and 14 nm, respectively. \n\n(IV) In order to explore the influence of the thickness of the posterior channel layer, under the condition that the anterior channel argon-oxygen ratio is 16:2 and the thickness is 12 nm, and the posterior channel argon-oxygen ratio is 65:20, the posterior channel layer is sputtered with the thickness of 30 nm, 40 nm, 50 nm and 60 nm, respectively. Then, all experimental Al (40 nm) thick source/drain electrodes were sputtered on all films by DC at room temperature at 25 ◦C, and finally, annealed at 250 ◦C for 1 h. \n\n## 2.2. Film And Device Properties\n\nWe studied the electrical properties of the device. The thickness of the film was measured by the surface profiler (KLA-Tencor). The surface morphology characteristics of the active layer were measured by an atomic force microscope (AFM). The cross-section morphology of the active layer was measured by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The square resistance was measured by a four-probe resistivity tester and the resistivity of the film was calculated. The transmission characteristics and output characteristics of TFT were obtained by means of the semiconductor device electrical performance test analyzer (Keithley 4200). \n\nIn liquid crystal displays, thin film transistors (TFTS) are often used as switching elements in pixel drivers to control the on-off of the liquid crystal. In this case, saturation mobility can be one of the important parameters to evaluate the performance of thin film transistors. The saturation mobility of thin film transistor affects its switching characteristics and response speed. Higher saturation mobility usually means faster switching speeds and better current drive capabilities, which are critical to achieving performance such as high refresh rates, low power consumption and high contrast of liquid crystal displays. The calculation formula of μsat is as follows: \nCox is the capacitance per unit area of the insulation layer. \n\nCOX = ε0κ\n\n![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)\n\nd \nL and W are the length and width of the channel, respectively. The mask we use has a width to length ratio of 100:1. IDS and VDS are the voltage and current between the S/D electrodes. \n\n## 3. **Results And Discussions**\n\nIn order to explore the influence of Ar:O2 on IGTO TFT, TFT under different concentration gradients were prepared, and the results were shown in the Table 1 below. \n\nVariation of carrier mobility with argon-oxygen ratio in a-IGTO TFT devices indicates that the increase of oxygen concentration can improve the carrier mobility of TFT. When the argon-oxygen ratio is large, the active layer IGTO film has more free carriers, so the AIGTO TFT device is like a conductor, and the off-state current is too large. When argon oxygen ratio is low. There are few free carriers in the IGTO film of the active layer, and the on-state current induced by the channel position is very small, so there is no way to form the switching effect of TFT. \n\nBy preparing different IGTO active layer thicknesses to explore the influence of active layer thickness, and the results were shown in Table 2. \n\nThe IGTO film is too thin and the number of carrier is too low, which leads to the decrease of carrier mobility. When the IGTO film is thick, the channel of the carrier transmission is far away from the surface of the film, and the influence of surface roughness on the carrier transmission is weaker. In contrast, the influence of surface roughness on the carrier transmission is stronger for the thin IGTO film, so the carrier mobility is lower. Therefore, the carrier mobility of thicker IGTO films is higher. It can also be seen from the table that the current switching ratio increases significantly with the increase of IGTO film thickness. This is possible because when the thickness of IGTO film increases, the number of carriers in the film increases, resulting in an increase in the open-state current of the device. At the same time, when the thickness of IGTO film increases, the carrier transmission path becomes longer, the off-state current decreases, and the current switching ratio increases. \n\nIn general, IGTO and IGZO act as the front channel (in contact with the insulation layer) and the back channel (in contact with the source drain) of the double active layer, respectively. The reason is that the electron mobility of IGTO material is large, which can provide more carriers for the device when it is switched on, thereby reducing the rush voltage of the device and increasing the oncurrent; while the electron mobility of a-IGZO material is small and the oxygen vacancy concentration is low, which can reduce the carrier concentration when the device is off, thereby reducing the leakage current [20]. \n\nBecause the Fermi energy levels of the two semiconductors are different, the energy band bends at the contact surface, resulting in a barrier and a potential well. If the depth of the potential well is large enough, the electrons in the potential well can only move in all directions of the plane. As the band around the heterojunction bends downward, electrons accumulate here, forming a region of high electron concentration. The electrons are confined to a narrow well, and the scattering effect of the donor impurities is greatly reduced. Therefore, the mobility of these two-dimensional electron gas moving along the plane direction will be very high [21]. \n\nIn heterojunction TFT (see Fig. 2), interfacial charge and interfacial state density affect charge transport and current flow. By optimizing the preparation process and material selection of the heterojunction, the interfacial state density can be reduced, thus reducing the influence of the interfacial charge and improving the performance of the device. The energy band shift at the heterojunction interface will affect the efficiency of electron injection and collection. By adjusting the band structure of the heterojunction, the efficiency of electron injection and collection can be improved, thus improving the conduction ability of the device. \n\nIt is not difficult to find in the numerous references on dual-channel active layer thin film transistors when the TFT active layer using the double-channel active layer structure, the carrier mobility of TFT can be improved, the threshold voltage can be reduced, and the current switching ratio can be greatly improved. Based on the above reasons, this paper not only explores the effects of argonoxygen ratio and active layer thickness on the performance of single-channel IGTO TFT devices, but also attempts to discuss the optimization of the performance of the IGTO/IGZO TFT devices from the perspectives of the argon-oxygen ratio of the front and rear channels and the thickness of the active layer. \n\nFig. 3 shows the transfer characteristic curves of IGTO/IGZO TFT devices at different argon-oxygen ratios of anterior channel and posterior channel. The performance parameters of the IGTO/IGZO TFT can be obtained by using the above formula, as shown in Table 3 and Table 4. \n\nAt low oxygen concentrations, the anterior channel IGTO film has a high carrier mobility. This indicates that the anterior channel IGTO film can normally be used as the opening channel of IGTO/IGZO TFT. With the increase of oxygen concentration, the oxygen vacancy concentration will decrease, and the carrier concentration of the IGTO film in the anterior channel will become smaller. As the IGTO/IGZO TFT opening channel, the electrical modulation effect of the active layer of the double channel will be weakened, and the carrier mobility of the device will be reduced, and the threshold voltage will be increased. IGTO/IGZO TFT devices are more difficult to \n\n| Performance parameters of a-IGTO TFT at different argon-oxygen ratios.

Appropriate oxygen content helps to improve the crystallinity and densification of the film, thereby improving the electron transport performance and stability. In the dual active layer structure, the oxide medium is used to isolate the electric field between the source/leakage electrode and the channel. Appropriate argon-oxygen ratio can adjust the dielectric properties of oxide media, ensure good insulation characteristics and capacitance properties, improve interface characteristics, reduce contact resistance, reduce interface state density, and thus improve the performance of TFT. When the oxygen concentration of the posterior channel decreases, the oxygen vacancy concentration of the posterior channel increases, the carrier concentration increases, the modulation effect of the active layer of the double channel is weakened, and the device performance deteriorates. \n\nFig. 4 shows the transfer characteristic curves of IGTO/IGZO TFT with different thicknesses of anterior channel and posterior channel. The performance parameters of the IGTO/IGZO TFT can be obtained by using the above formula, as shown in Table 5 and Table 6. \n\nAs shown in Fig. 5, the average surface roughness Ra of IGTO topography under different thicknesses is (a) 0.605 nm, (b) 0.582 nm, \n(c) 0.562 nm, and (d) 0.543 nm. With the increase of sputtering thickness, the surface roughness of IGTO decreases. When the thickness of the anterior channel film is too thin, the film forming quality is poor and the resistance of the anterior channel active layer is too large. When the thickness of the anterior channel film is too high, the resistance of the anterior channel active layer increases and the electrical modulation of the double channel active layer deteriorates due to the longer carrier transmission path [22,23]. \n\nIn general, when the channel thickness is thicker, the threshold voltage will become higher, and vice versa. This is due to the fact that thicker channels will increase the electric field coupling effect between the channel and the control electrode, resulting in the need for higher voltage to make the channel open. When the channel is thinner, the carrier can pass through the channel more easily, thereby reducing the on-resistance and improving the on-ability, and at the same time, the carrier can reduce the travel distance in the channel, thereby increasing the carrier speed and speeding up the switching speed. \n\nThe active layer of the posterior channel acts as the closed channel of the double-channel active layer TFT device. When the active layer is thin and the device is in the off state, part of the carriers pass through the IGTO film of the anterior channel, and the current of the off state is too large. The surface defects of the film are more, which leads to the low mobility of the film. Thicker IGZO layer will form higher interfacial state resistance, and the scattering phenomenon of carriers will be enhanced during transport, the carrier transmission path becomes longer, which leads to the decrease of carrier mobility and the increase of threshold voltage, and the device performance deteriorates. \n\nIn addition, we also prepared single active layer IGZO and IGTO TFTS, and compared double active layer IGZO/IGTO and IGTO/ \nIGZO TFTs to verify the influence of double channel heterojunction and the position effect of anterior and posterior channels. The performance of TFTs of different structures are shown in Table 7.

Since heterojunction TFT uses the interface between different materials to form heterojunction, higher carrier injection and conduction capabilities can be achieved, and the efficiency of electron injection and collection can be improved, thus speeding up the switching speed. The adjustment of the band structure of the heterojunction and the density of the interface state can achieve a lower threshold voltage, that\n\n![5_image_0.png](5_image_0.png)\n\n| Performance parameters of IGTO/IGZO TFT at different anterior channel thickness.   |                          |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Thickness of anterior channel[nm]                                                  | Pse[cm 2 ·V − 1 ·s − 1 ] |\n| 18                                                                                 | 6.36                     |\n| 10                                                                                 | 17.54                    |\n| 12112                                                                              | 10.23                    |\n| 1414                                                                               | 7.43                     |\n\n| Vah[V]   |\n|----------|\n| 3.8      |\n| 0.6      |\n| 4.6      |\n| 6.16.1   |\n\n| S[V dec − 1 ]   |\n|-----------------|\n| 1.55            |\n| 0.64            |\n| 1, 21           |\n| 2.65            |\n\n| Ian-Iaff   |\n|------------|\n| 2.7 Q 10 2 |\n| 6.4010 6   |\n| 5.5 10 3   |\n| 4.8010 5   |\n\n| Table 6                                                                           |                          |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Performance parameters of IGTO/IGZO TFT at different posterior channel thickness. |                          |\n| Thickness of posterior channel[nm]                                                | Psse[cm 2 V 2 1 ,$ 2 1 ] |\n| 20  20                                                                            | 18.76                    |\n| 30                                                                                | 17.25                    |\n| 40                                                                                | 10.23                    |\n| 50                                                                                | 5.15                     |\n\n| V th [V]   |\n|------------|\n| 0.4        |\n| 0.6        |\n| 1.8        |\n| 3.5        |\n\n| S[V dec − 1 ]   |\n|-----------------|\n| 1.69            |\n| 0.67            |\n| 1.52            |\n| 1.81            |\n\n| Ion-Loff   |\n|------------|\n| 3.2010 4   |\n| 9.7010 6   |\n| 6.80 5     |\n| 5.9010 2   |\n\nis, the conduction starts at a lower control voltage.

On the other hand, different device structures show significantly different saturated conduction current, indicating that the heterogeneous bond has a significant modulating effect on channel conduction, and IGTO/IGZO can increase the conductivity of the channel better than IGZO/IGTO to increase the saturation output current of the device. \n\nFig. 7 shows SFM morphologies of IGTO/IGZO thin films. Because of the high energy of the field emission scanning electron microscope and the thin film thickness, the section is bombarded by high-energy particle beams, so we can not see the specific thickness of the section. Fortunately, we calculate the thickness by calculating the rate of magnetron sputtering and controlling the time under the above conditions. \n\n## 4. **Conclusion**\n\nIn this paper, IGTO/IGZO TFTS were prepared by DC magnetron sputtering, and the effects of argon-oxygen ratio and active layer thickness on the performance of double-channel TFT devices were studied. The performance of heterojunction IGTO/IGZO TFT is better. This can be attributed in part to the large conduction band shift between the heterojunction IGTO/IGZO, which generates twodimensional electron gas at the heterojunction interface. Improve the performance of double-channel TFT devices. Heterojunction IGTO/IGZO TFT can be prepared at low temperature with high mobility, and has great potential for future applications in electronic products and flat panel displays. \n\n![7_image_0.png](7_image_0.png)\n\n![7_image_1.png](7_image_1.png)\n\nLei Zhang: Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Resources, Software, Writing - original draft.

The conductive source/drain regions were formed by hydrogen incorporation during the deposition of SiOx or SiNx passivation layer using plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). The effect of passivation layer deposition condition on the electrical performance of self-aligned top-gate aIGZO TFTs was investigated. It was shown that the source-drain parasitic resistance (Rsd*) was effectively reduced during the* deposition of SiNx passivation layer than SiOx. However, as the deposition temperature of SiNx *passivation layer increased,* hydrogen lateral diffusion into channel region resulted in the shrinkage of effective channel length and the deterioration of electrical performance of short-channel device. \n\n## Author Keywords\n\nself-aligned top-gate; a-IGZO; thin-film transistors; hydrogen diffusion \n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nIn recent years, amorphous oxide semiconductor thin film transistors (AOS-TFTs), especially a-IGZO TFTs have been extensively investigated for application in the next generation displays like active-matrix organic light-emitting diode displays (AMOLEDs) due to the advantages of high mobility, low processing temperature and large area uniformity [1], [2]. Generally, bottom-gate structure such as etch-stop layer (ESL) or back-channel etched (BCE) is widely applied for a-IGZO TFTs [3], [4]. However, there is large overlap capacitance between gate and source/drain electrodes for this structure, and the large parasitic capacitance induces the signal RC delay [5], which is undesirable for high frame rates displays. The self-aligned topgate (SATG) is preferred due to the low parasitic capacitance and short channel length compared to bottom-gate structure and has attracted more and more attention [6]. As we know, the formation of conductive source/drain regions is the key issue in fabrication of SATG devices. It has been reported that the a-IGZO film can be made highly conductive by hydrogen diffusion from SiNx films deposited by PECVD process as the hydrogen acted as shallow donor in a-IGZO film and effectively increase the carrier concentration [7]. In this paper, self-aligned top-gate a-IGZO TFTs were prepared, the conductive source/drain regions were formed by hydrogen incorporation with SiOx or SiNx passivation layers by PECVD. Here we studied the effects of passivation material and deposition temperature on the performance of self-aligned top-gate a-IGZO TFTs. The effect of hydrogen diffusion especially in short channel device was also investigated in detail. \n\n![0_image_0.png](0_image_0.png)\n\nFigure 1. Schematic cross section of self-aligned top-gate a-IGZO TFTs. \n\n## 2. Experiments\n\nSelf-aligned top-gate a-IGZO TFTs are fabricated on glass substrate. The schematic cross section view is presented in Fig.1. First, a 40-nm-thick a-IGZO active layer was deposited by DC sputtering at room temperature and pattered by wet-etching. Then, the active layer was treated by N2O plasma for 180s in PECVD chamber at 150 °C, and a 200-nm-thick SiOx gate insulator was deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) without breaking the vacuum. After that, the devices were annealed in pure oxygen at 300 °C for 1.5 h. Next, a 120nm-thick Molybdenum (Mo) as top-gate electrode was deposited by DC sputtering, and the gate electrode and gate insulator were continuously dry-etched. A 200-nm-thick SiOx or SiNx passivation layer was deposited by PECVD to form the conductive source/drain regions by hydrogen incorporation during the deposition process of hydrogen-rich passivation layer. The SiOx was deposited at 150 °C, and the SiNx layers were deposited at the temperature of 150, 200, and 250 °C, respectively. Finally, Mo metal layer was deposited and pattered as source/drain metal after the contact holes formation. Electrical characteristics measurements of fabricated devices were carried out using an Agilent B1500 semiconductor analyzer in dark. \n\n## 3. Results And Discussion\n\nThe transfer characteristics curves of self-aligned top-gate aIGZO TFTs with various passivation layer are shown in Fig.2. \n\nThe fabricated SATG TFTs are with channel width of 20μm and channel length of 20, 10, 5, and 3μm, respectively. As clearly seen in Fig.2, the devices with SiOx or SiNx passivation layer deposited in lower temperature like 150°C~200°C exhibits normal switching property, even as the channel length decreased to 3μm. However, as the deposition temperature increased to 250°C, the threshold voltage of fabricated TFTs evidently decreased especially for the device of channel length below 5μm. To note that, the subthreshold slope also gets worse. Fig. 3 shows the transfer characteristics curves of device with channel length of 10μm and width of 20μm. The field-effect mobility (μFE) and threshold voltage (VTH) are extracted from the linear region at Vds=0.1V. And the subthreshold slope (SS) is taken as (dlog(IDS)/dVGS)\n-1 of the range 10 pA≤IDS ≤100 pA. All the electrical parameters extracted from the transfer curves are listed in Table 1. \n\n![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)\n\nSiNx@150C \nSiNx@250C \n\n![1_image_1.png](1_image_1.png)\n\n| Passivation   | VTH   | SS      | μFE         | ΔL   | Rsd*W   |\n|---------------|-------|---------|-------------|------|---------|\n| layer         | (V)   | (V/dec) | (cm2 /(Vs)) | (μm) | (Ω*cm)  |\n| SiOx@150°C    | 0.52  | 0.36    | 13.3        | 0.73 | 69.8    |\n| SiNx@150°C    | 0.22  | 0.41    | 14.2        | 1.33 | 35.0    |\n| SiNx@200°C    | 0.10  | 0.42    | 11.8        | 2.22 | 37.6    |\n| SiNx@250°C    | -2.46 | 0.58    | 8.06        | 5.60 | 51.6    |\n\nincreased from 0.36V/dec to 0.58V/dec. As is known that SiOx or SiNx films deposited by PECVD process contain large amount of hydrogen, the channel of self-aligned top-gate device suffers hydrogen diffusion during the passivation layer deposition process, consequently increasing the carrier concentration. The TFTs need more negative gate voltage to be turned off and the deterioration of field-effect mobility and SS could be related to the hydrogen diffusion into channel region [8]. In order to further investigate the effect of hydrogen diffusion in self-aligned top-gate device, the transmission line method (TLM) is carried out to extract the parasitic source/drain resistance (Rsd) and the differences in channel length (ΔL), the relationship between Rsd and total resistance RT is expressed by the following equations:\n\n$$R_{T}=\\frac{V_{ds}}{I_{ds}}=R_{sd}+r_{ch}L_{eff}\\tag{1}$$  $$r_{ch}=\\frac{1}{\\mu C_{\\alpha x}W\\left(V_{gs}-V_{th}\\right)}\\tag{2}$$  Here, Rt is the total resistance of source/drain contact resistance \nand channel resistance, Cox is the capacitance per uint area of gate insulator, rch is the channel resistance per unit length, Leff is the effective channel length, giving Leff=LM-ΔL, where LM is the mask channel length. The extracted parameters of Rsd*W and ΔL are listed in Table 1.\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100\n\n![1_image_3.png](1_image_3.png) \nChannel Length (m) *W=20*m \n\n![1_image_2.png](1_image_2.png) \nSiOx@150C SiNx**@150**C \nW=20m \n\nW=20m W=20m\n\nFigure 4. Total resistances of self-aligned top-gate a-IGZO \nTFTs plotted as a function of channel length at various gate voltages with different passivation layer. Fig. 4 shows the curves of RT-L at various gate voltages. The source/drain contact resistance and the difference of mask length and effective channel length can be accurately extracted at the cross-point of red lines in Fig. 4. As seen in Table 1, comparing to the device with SiOx passivation layer deposited at 150°C, the width-normalized contact resistance (Rsd*W) of device with SiNx is nearly half, decreasing from 69.8 Ω*cm to 35.0 Ω*cm, but the ΔL is slightly larger. However, the ΔL of device increased as the deposition temperature of SiNx passivation layer increased, and the ΔL is even 5.6 μm at 250 °C, which means the effective channel length of device in Fig.3 is nearly half of the mask length!\n\n-20 -10 0 **10 20**\n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)\n\n -10 0 **10 20** \nL=10m annealed W=20m Vds*=0.1V*\nFigure 5. The transfer curves of device as-deposited and annealed for 2h at 250 °C with SiNx passivation layer with a channel length of (a) 100μm and (b) 10μm. It is believed that hydrogen in PECVD SiOx or SiNx could diffuse into a-IGZO film and act as shallow donors in oxide semiconductors, which could significantly increasing the carrier concentration in a-IGZO layer, thus, reducing the resistance of aIGZO [7]. Due to the higher concentration hydrogen in SiNx passivation layer than SiOx with the typical PECVD conditions, a lower resistance of self-aligned source/drain regions was obtained. To point that, the high concentration hydrogen could also diffuse laterally into channel regions, resulting the shrinkage of effective channel length.\n\n![2_image_1.png](2_image_1.png)\n\nFigure 6. The schematic of hydrogen diffusion from passivation layer of self-aligned top-gate a-IGZO TFTs and the hydrogen concentration distribution in source/drain and channel regions in short-channel device. In order to further investigate the effect of hydrogen diffusion, the device of long and short channel length (L=100μm and 10μm) with SiNx passivation layer deposited at 150°C was annealed at vacuum in 250 °C for 2 h. Fig. 5 shows the comparison of transfer curves with long and short channel length device. It's clear to see that for long channel device, the electrical characteristics change a little, however, for short channel device, the VTH dramatically shifts to about -15 V and the on-state current drops remarkably after annealing, which may be related to the hydrogen concentration redistribution in source/drain and channel regions. \n\nAs shown in figure 6, the hydrogen diffuses from conductive source/drain regions into channel region during high temperature annealing, the carrier concentration in channel region increases and the transistor needs a more negative voltage to be turned off, in the same time, the decrease of carrier concentration in source/drain regions results in the increase of parasitic Rsd and the reduction of on-state current. So it's of great importance to control the deposition condition of passivation layer of SATG TFTs, on the one hand, to decrease the resistance of source/drain IGZO regions, on the other hand, to minimize the hydrogen lateral diffusion into channel region.\n\n4. Conclusion The effect of deposition condition of SiOx or SiNx passivation layer on the performance of self-aligned top-gate a-IGZO TFTs was investigated. It's shown that SiNx passivation layer could effectively reduce the Rsd of SATG a-IGZO TFTs compared to SiOx. However, the hydrogen lateral diffusion into channel region leads to the shrinkage of efficient channel length and the deterioration of the performance of short-channel device. \n\n## 5.

In this paper, the effects of NH3 plasma treatment to form n+ region have been investigated. The results show that the top gate coplanar structure Amorphous indium-gallium-zincoxide(a-IGZO) TFTs with n+ source/drain by NH3 treatment exhibit high mobility and good subthreshold swing (SS), which indicates that the NH3 *plasma treatment can effectively reduce the* contact resistance.\n\n## Author Keywords\n\nCoplanar structure; High mobility; a-IGZO TFT; NH3 plasma treatment. \n\n1. Introduction Amorphous oxide semiconductors (AOS) have been much investigated as the replacement of conventional amorphous silicon as the active layer in TFTs. In particular, a-IGZO TFTs exhibit high mobility, low SS, extremely low off-current and good uniformity. These advantages enable the application of a-IGZO TFTs to active-matrix liquid crystal displays (LCDs) and organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs)[1]. \n\nCoplanar structure a-IGZO TFTs have been developed for the feature of low parasitic capacitance than bottom gate staggered structure, which is limited in the application in high-speed circuits due to the large overlap between the gate and source/drain[2-3]. \n\nHowever, there are still many problems to be solved in the coplanar process. The absence of overlap between the gate and source/drain metal layer in top gate self-align coplanar structure results in smaller parasitic capacitance and better channel length scalability, but may also cause the bad contact between source/drain metal and active layer. So that the formation of source/drain region with doping process could be the key process to get high mobility[4]. In this paper, NH3 plasma treatment is introduced to form highly doped n+ region for IGZO film, and coplanar TFTs with good performance were obtained. \n\n## 2. Fabrication\n\nFig.1(a)-(c) shows the fabrication process of top-gate self-align coplanar structure a-IGZO TFTs. First, a-IGZO with a thickness of 25 nm was prepared on the SiO2 substrate as active layer using sputtering. Then, a layer of 200 nm of SiO2 was deposited as gate insulator (GI) by PECVD and 48 nm of Mo was deposited as gate electrode by sputtering. After the deposition, gate was patterned by dry etching, and SiO2 was self-align etched, followed by patterning IGZO using wet etching, as shown in Fig.1(a). After the etching process, the NH3 plasma treatment was introduced for the n+ region formation. Due to the masking of upper layer, the plasma treatment was selectively performed and the source/drain regions were self-aligned formed, as shown in Fig.1(b). After that, a 150-nm-layer of SiNx was deposited and patterned as interlayer dielectric (ILD). Finally, 48 nm of Mo was deposited as the\n\n![0_image_0.png](0_image_0.png)\n\nFigure 1.

(c) Schematic cross section of coplanar a-IGZO TFT. source/drain electrode by sputtering, and patterned by dry etching process. The schematic cross section of the fabricated coplanar structure a-IGZO TFTs is shown as Fig.1(c). \n\n## 3. **Result And Conclusion**\n\nFig.2(a) shows the drain current (IDS) - gate voltage (VGS) characteristics of the coplanar a-IGZO TFT fabricated by the process mentioned above and the TFT exhibited excellent transfer characteristics. The width/length of the device was 20/10 μm. The field-effect mobility (μFE) and subthreshold swing was estimated to be 16.34 cm2/Vs and 205 mV/dec. Fig.2(b) shows the IDS-VDS\ncharacteristics. It can be seen that with the NH3 plasma treatment method, the TFT exhibited good ohmic behavior without current crowding. It indicates that the n+ region was selectively formed in source/drain region by plasma treatment, so that the introduce of NH3 plasma treatment could realize low contact resistance. Table.1 gives a conclusion of the TFT performances with different channel width/lengths. Owing to the optimized process, coplanar structure TFTs were fabricated with high μFE, low SS, and good ohmic contact. \n\neduction personal processing the content of the content.\n\n![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)\n\n| width/lengths   |                |           |        |\n|-----------------|----------------|-----------|--------|\n| W/L( m m)       | µµµµ(cm 2 /Vs) | S(mV/dec) | Vth(V) |\n| 8/10            | 17.59          | 216       |        |\n| 259             |                |           |        |\n| 88              | 15.38          | 1.5       |        |\n| 20/10           | 16.34          | 205       | i      |\n| 20/8            | 15.40          | 182       | i      |\n\n## References\n\n1.\n\nKamiya T, Nomura K, Hosono H.

        "text": "# Self-Heating Induced Degradation In A Metal-Oxide Thin-Film Transistor On A Flexible Substrate And Its Mitigation\n\nZhihe Xia1,2, Runxiao Shi1,2, Lei Lu3*, Hoi-Sing Kwok1,2, Man Wong1,2* 1Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, 2State Key Laboratory on Advanced Displays and Optoelectronics and Technologies, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong 3School of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Peking University, Shenzhen, China\n\n## Abstract\n\nSelf-heating effects (SHE) in a metal-oxide thin-film transistor (TFT) built on a polyimide substrate are characterized and their correlation to the effects on the TFT subjected to positive-bias thermal stress is verified. Techniques of mitigating SHE are proposed, including breaking up a wide channel into parallel tracks of narrower channels or fluorination of the channel.\n\n## Author Keywords\n\nSelf-heating, thin-film transistor, TFT, flexible electronics, indiumgallium-zinc oxide, IGZO, fluorination. \n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nEnabled by their relatively higher field-effect mobility () \nand better stability as current-delivering devices, metal-oxide (MO) thin-film transistors (TFTs) are gradually replacing their amorphous-silicon counterparts in active-matrix flat-panel displays (1–3). Because of their relatively lower process temperature, they are also being investigated for implementing the active electronic circuits (4,5) in systems fabricated on lowtemperature flexible substrates, such as gate-drivers in flexible display panel, near-field communication tag (6), and biochemical sensor (7), etc. \n\nWhile attention has been paid to the stability of a MO TFT \nagainst current-stress (8), much more has been reported on that against voltage-stress (9–11). Self-heating induced instability is one among the former, such as those reported for TFTs handling relatively large current in a gate driver (12,13). It can be anticipated to present more of an issue for a system with a weaker ability to dissipate heat, such as those realized on a glass or flexible substrate. Compared to the thermal conductivity of \n~150 W/m⋅K for silicon (14,15), those of the popular indiumgallium-zinc oxide (IGZO) (16) and common insulators such as silicon oxide (SiOx) and nitride (SiNy) are roughly two orders of magnitude lower. At ~0.1 W/m⋅K (17,18), the thermal conductivity of the polyimide (PI) popularly used as a flexible substrate is even lower. \n\nDenoted by ୢ and ୢ the respective drain-current and -bias, it is the Joule's heating (ୢୢ ) that is responsible for the temperature-rise in the channel of a TFT. Self-heating effects (SHE) in MO TFTs have been reported, resulting from a coupling of the heating of the channel and a high gate-bias (). \n\nThe reported SHE are consistent with the effects on a TFT subjected to a positive-bias thermal stress (PBTS). For a bottom-gate TFT exhibiting a positive shift in its threshold voltage due to PBTS dominated by electron-trapping in the gate-dielectric facing the front-channel, a decrease in ୢ was observed during a constant-ୢ self-heating stress (19). For one exhibiting a negative shift due to PBTS dominated by holeaccumulation near the interface with the dielectric above the back-channel, an increase in ୢ was observed (20,21). \n\nIn this work, SHE of elevated-metal metal-oxide (EMMO) \nIGZO TFTs (22) fabricated on PI are investigated, and verified to be consistent with the effects on TFTs exhibiting PBTS dominated by hole-trapping. It is also reported that SHE can be mitigated, by either proper layout design of the TFT channel for more efficient heat-dissipation or fluorination of the channel. \n\n## 2. Experimental\n\nThe preparation of the EMMO TFTs started with the coating of a 10-μm-thick layer of PI on a 500-μm-thick glass substrate. \n\nA buffer layer consisting of a stack of 300-nm-thick SiOx on 200-nm-thick SiNy was deposited at 300 ℃ using plasmaenhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). A 100-nmthick layer of molybdenum (Mo) was sputtered on the buffer layer as the bottom-gate. The gate dielectric consisted of a PECVD stack of 75-nm-thick SiOx on 50-nm-thick SiNy. A 20 nm-thick IGZO active layer was sputtered at room temperature in an atmosphere of 10% oxygen (O2) and 90% argon using a target of composition In2O3:Ga2O3:ZnO=1:1:1. Some of the samples were fluorinated in a tetrafluoromethane plasma for 10 minutes to form IGZO:F (23). The active layer was patterned using 1/2000 molar aqueous hydrofluoric acid solution, before a 300-nm-thick PECVD SiOx passivation layer was formed. \n\nThe contact areas were opened in an inductively coupled plasma etcher running a sulfur hexafluoride chemistry. The source/drain (S/D) electrodes were made of sputtered and patterned stacks of 300-nm-thick aluminum (Al) on 50-nmthick Mo contact-layer. Consequently for an EMMO TFT (Fig. \n\n1a), the channel region was covered by a gas-permeable SiOx, while the S/D regions were covered by stacks of impermeable Al/Mo. Finally, the TFTs were annealed at 300 °C in O2 for 2 hrs to form the conductive S/D regions. For comparison, the same fabrication process was conducted on a silicon substrate covered with a 0.5-μm-thick layer of thermal silicon oxide. The TFTs were electrically characterized using an Agilent 4156C \nSemiconductor Parameter Analyzer. \n\n## 3. Results And Discussion\n\nShown in Figure 1b are the drain current ୢ *vs.* gate voltage \n\n![1_image_1.png](1_image_1.png)\n\n transfer characteristics of EMMO TFTs fabricated on Substrate S consisting of oxide-on-silicon or Substrate P \nconsisting of PI-on-glass. The respective channel width  and length  are 50 and 20 μm; the drain voltage ୢ was fixed at 10 V. The two sets of characteristics nicely overlap, showing insignificant difference. For ୢ >  . the ୢ vs. ୢ output characteristics (Fig. 1c) of a TFT built on Substrate S exhibit normal saturation behavior, though with a small slant consistent with a positive output resistance. However, those (Fig. 1d) of a TFT built on Substrate P are different, showing a slightly higher \nୢ for characteristics with  ≤ 30 V. For  = 40 V, ୢ\nexhibits a steep rise with increasing ୢ before \"collapsing\" at a sufficiently high ୢ to a much lower value. Shown respectively in Figures 1e and 1f are the optical images of TFTs on Substrate P before and after the test resulting in the collapse of ୢ. \n\nP-11 / Z. Xia the normalized current ୢ⁄ is compared in Figure 2a. While \n\n![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)\n\na constant ୢ⁄ ~3.8 μA/μm is maintained for the narrower 50-μm-wide TFT, that of the wider TFT exhibits again a steep rise with stress time before eventually collapsing to a lower value. The transfer characteristics of the wider TFT at four instances labelled I, II, III and IV are displayed in Figure 2b, showing a continuous negative shift of the turn-on voltage ୭୬\n(≡  inducing an ୢ = 10 ×  ⁄ nA at ୢ = 5 V) from −0.9 V (Instance I: initial) to −11.4 V (Instance III: after 400 s stress) and beyond −20 V just before the ୢ collapses around Instance IV. A wider TFT was also subjected to a constantcurrent stress at a higher ୢ⁄ ~5 μA/μm and the same  =\n40 V. The time-evolution of the ୢ needed to maintain the constant stress-current is plotted in Figure 2c, showing a gradual decrease and eventual weak saturation. No abrupt change in either ୢ or ୢ was observed when stressed in the constant-ୢ configuration. \n\nWhile Joule's heating induces a rise in the temperature of a TFT built on Substrate P, the rise is significantly milder in a TFT built on Substrate S with a much higher thermal conductivity. The mild temperature change of the latter may be responsible for the small slant (Fig. 1c) of the output characteristics of such a TFT. The higher temperature of the former, when combined with the high  , leads to PBTS-\n\n## P-11 / Z. Xia\n\ninduced negative shift in ୭୬, thus resulting in a higher ୢ (Figs. \n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)\n\n1d and 2a) and more severe Joule's heating. It is this positive feedback that leads to the eventual thermal run-away and the physical destruction of the TFT shown in Figure 1f. In the case of a constant-current stress, a negative shift in ୭୬ results in a decrease in the ୢ (Fig. 2c) needed to maintain a given ୢ, hence also a reduction in ୢୢ. Such negative feedback prevents the thermal run-away in a constant-current stress configuration. A \nwider TFT suffers more from SHE (Fig. 2a) because of the reduced efficiency in removing heat from the center of the device. \n\nFigure 3. The time-evolution of the transfer characteristics of (a) a non-fluorinated and (b) a fluorinated EMMO TFTs on Substrate P subjected to the same PBTS at 85 °C and Vg = Von + 20 V.\n\nFor a given requirement on current-drive, SHE can be reduced by breaking up a wide channel (say 200 μm) into parallel tracks of narrower channels (say 4 × 50 μm) for more efficient heat dissipation. However, this approach comes with a penalty in requiring a larger device footprint. IGZO:F was investigated as an alternative channel material because of the higher stability (Fig. 3b) of the resulting TFT. Compared in Figure 4 is the stability of TFTs built on IGZO and IGZO:F \nagainst a constant-bias stress condition of ୢ = 30 V and  =\n35 V. By a factor of about 4, the average time-to-breakdown is longer for the latter. \n\n![2_image_1.png](2_image_1.png)\n\n## 4. Conclusion\n\nSHE on an EMMO TFT built on a PI substrate are found to be significantly more severe than those on a TFT built on a silicon substrate. This is consistent with the much smaller thermal conductivity of PI. The observed SHE are found to be consistent with PBTS inducing a negative shift in ୭୬ . \n\nApproaches to mitigate SHE include breaking up a wide channel into parallel tracks of narrower channels or fluorination of the channel. \n\n## Acknowledgment\n\nThis work was supported by Technology Fund, and Grant SGDX2019081623360954 from Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Committee and PSKL12EG02 from the Partner State Key Laboratory on Advanced Displays and Optoelectronics Technologies.

We showed that the resistance of the IGZO film is reduced when a high-mobility IGZO film is used as the active layer. This leads to a sufficiently reduced resistance of the source and drain regions and thus an increased on-state current. This allowed us to fabricate a 4K2K\nLCD panel with an integrated DeMUX. The top-gate structure enables reduction in parasitic capacitance and improvement in driving capability, so that a panel with a narrow bezel can be obtained.\n\n## 7.\n\n[1]\n\n[2] [3]\n[4] [5]\n[6]\nbbcc3 bcn au131 attr 202 (112029080) no vandL1 snitnO voliW , volenvill/ nanit ed 11011 gibs2001.01/pb/me enЭ obtrailiqu ad vel bomo vog are solving VC) tasn to solvi xol vendi.

Wang Student Poster Non-Oxidizing Pre-Annealing For Enhanced Fluorination Of An Indiumgallium-Zinc Oxide **Thin-Film Transistor**\n\nSisi Wang1, Lei Lu2, Nannan Lv3, and *Man Wong*1 1**Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering,The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology,** \nClear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong 2**School of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Peking University, Shenzhen, China**\n3**School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Soochow University, Suzhou, 215006, China**\n\n## Abstract\n\nDifferent processes have been investigated for the fluorination of amorphous indium-gallium-zinc oxide (IGZO) thin-film transistors (TFTs) and the reliability of the resulting TFTs subjected to a positive gate-bias thermal stress has been compared. It is shown that the negative shift of the turn-on voltage of a TFT improved with an increase in the fluorination time. Such improvement correlates well with the annihilation of oxygen-related defects in the fluorinated channels. However, further extension of the fluorination time has been found to lead to degradation of some device characteristics. An alternative process has been proposed, involving the addition of a nonoxidizing anneal before the fluorination treatment. More positive shift of the turn-on voltage and improvement in reliability have been obtained, without the TFT suffering from degradation in other device characteristics. \n\n## Author Keywords\n\nIndium-gallium-zinc oxide; fluorination; annealing; reliability; positive bias temperature stress; thin-film transistors.\n\n1. **Introduction**\nMetal-oxide thin-film transistors (TFTs), such as amorphous indiumgallium-zinc oxide (IGZO) TFTs are deployed in some flexible electronic systems and advanced flat-panel displays (1)(2). Techniques of overcoming instability issues and the negative turn-on voltage (on)\nof the IGZO TFT have been investigated to obtain higher performance and lower power consumption in these applications. Much work has been done on these issues of amorphous IGZO TFTs, especially on the influence of the annealing atmosphere and defect-passivation techniques (3)(4)(5). It has been reported that an IGZO TFT when fluorinated by exposure to a fluorine (F)-containing plasma resulted in the formation of fluorinated IGZO, i.e. IGZO:F. TFTs fabricated with IGZO:F have been shown to exhibit significantly positive on, higher resilience against hydrogen-induced degradation and improved reliability against electrical, thermal, and illumination stress (6)(7)(8). Motivated by the passivation of oxygen-related defects through plasma fluorination treatment (5)(7), IGZO:F TFTs subjected to different plasma treatment times have been studied. The fluorination process and their defect-annihilation effects have been revealed by characterizing the TFTs under the positive gate-bias and thermal stress (PBTS) measurements. A process-induced limitation is revealed, putting a cap on the fluorination time. An alternative fluorination process is presently proposed, demonstrating TFTs exhibiting further enhanced performance and improved stability. \n\n## 2. **Experimental**\n\nBottom-gate IGZO TFTs were fabricated on oxidized silicon wafers. 150-nm-thick molybdenum (Mo) layer was sputtered and patterned as the bottom gate electrode. The gate dielectric stack, consisting of 50nm SiNy and 75-nm SiOx, was deposited at 300°C in a plasmaenhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) reactor. A 25-nm-thick IGZO active layer was subsequently deposited at room temperature by radio-frequency magnetron sputtering using an IGZO target\n(Composition: In2O3:Ga2O3:ZnO = 1:1:1) in an atmosphere of 10% oxygen (O2) and 90% argon at a total pressure of 3 mTorr. A group of the samples was then fluorinated in a tetrafluorocarbon (CF4) plasma between 5 to 15 minutes at a power of 30 W in the same PECVD chamber, thus forming thin films of IGZO:F; some samples of this group were annealed in nitrogen (N2) at 400°C for 2 hrs before the fluorination treatment; the rest of the samples was not fluorinated. All samples were subsequently covered with a layer of 50-nm-thick PECVD SiOx. After patterning of this SiOx cover layer in an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) etcher running a sulfur hexafluoride chemistry followed by etching of the IGZO in dilute hydrofluoric acid, the active islands of SiOx on IGZO were covered with a passivation layer of 250-nm SiOx deposited using the same PECVD process as that used for forming the gate dielectric. Subsequent to a thermal annealing at 400°C in O2 for 2 hrs, contacts to the source/drain (S/D) regions were opened in the same ICP etcher. A sputtered stack of gasimpermeable 50-nm Mo under 300-nm aluminum (Al) bilayer was patterned to form the S/D electrodes. Finally, elevated-metal metaloxide (EMMO) TFTs were realized by annealing at 400 °C in O2 for 4 hrs. In an EMMO TFT, the portion of the IGZO exposed to the oxidizing atmosphere through the gas-permeable SiOx forms the intrinsic active channel region, resulting from the passivation of the donor-defects (9). The portions of the IGZO covered under the gasimpermeable Al/Mo electrodes are converted to conductive, annealing-induced S/D regions. Consequently, the electrical channel length () of an EMMO TFT is defined by the separation between the metal electrodes (6)(9)(10). The electrical characteristics of the TFTs were measured using an Agilent 4156C Semiconductor Parameter Analyzer. The S/D electrodes were grounded during a PBTS measurement. \n\n## 3. **Results And Discussion**\n\nTFTs fluorinated in CF4 plasma treatment times of 0, 10, and 13 mins were subjected to PBTS tests at 85°C and a gate bias (g) of 20 V. The transfer characteristics of the TFTs, i.e. the dependence of the drain current (d) on g were measured, with the source grounded and the drain biased at d = 5 V. The characteristics before (0) and after PBTS \ntests for 30000 seconds (30 ks) are displayed and compared in Figure 1. The channel width/length (/) of the TFTs are 100 μm/100 μm.\n\nBefore the PBTS tests, a turn-on voltage (on) of −0.6 V was obtained for the un-fluorinated IGZO TFTs (F-0 min), where on is defined as the g needed to induce an d of 1 pA during a forward g -sweep. \n\nConsistent with the reported behavior resulting from the incorporation of F in IGZO (6)(11), the initial characteristics of the corresponding IGZO:F TFTs (Samples F-10 min and F-13 min) exhibited a slightly more positive on of 0 V. After the 30 ks PBTS tests, negative shifts in the on of the TFTs were observed, with the IGZO TFTs exhibited a large negative shift of 2.4 V. Improved reliability of the IGZO:F \nTFTs against the same stress configuration was observed, with smaller negative shifts of 1.4 V for IGZO:F TFTs subjected to 10-min fluorination and 0.7 V for IGZO:F TFTs subjected to 13-min fluorination. The suppressed negative shifts of on compared to those \n\n## P-18 / S. Wang Student Poster\n\nof the un-fluorinated IGZO TFTs have been attributed to the reduction of the population of oxygen-deficient defects in IGZO:F TFTs (6).\n\n![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)\n\nThe dependence of the Von on PBTS time is plotted in Figure 2.\n\nConsistent with the previous reports, the continuous negative shift in Von was suppressed by increased fluorination plasma treatment time.\n\n![1_image_2.png](1_image_2.png)\n\nMotivated by the desire to realize TFTs with even better reliability, the plasma treatment time was increased to 15 mins. However, gatecontrol of the resulting TFTs was lost, as shown in Figure 2b. An Ig higher than 10 nA (even higher if not clamped by 4165C) was measured, as shown in Figure 2c. It was suspected that the degradation was induced by the penetration of excess F into the gate insulator layer underneath the active layer during the extended fluorination treatment, as illustrated in Figure 2d.\n\nSince non-oxidizing thermal annealing was proposed to result in the generation of an oxygen-deficient IGZO film (9), its application prior to a fluorination process might help the film retain more of the F during a subsequent fluorination process, thus preventing F from penetrating to the underlying gate dielectrics. This possibility has been investigated in the present work by the incorporation of a 400°C, 2 hrs annealing in N 2 prior to a 5-min fluorination process. The experimental design and the cross-section of the fabricated EMMO TFTs are illustrated in Figure 3. After the deposition of the IGZO active layer, a group of the samples was fluorinated in a CF 4 plasma for 5 minutes, thus forming the reference IGZO:F; some samples of this group were annealed in N 2 at 400°C for 2 hrs before the same fluorination process; the rest of the samples was not fluorinated.\n\n![1_image_1.png](1_image_1.png)\n\nThe transfer characteristics of the resulting TFTs are shown in Figure 4. Consistent with previous studies, a more negative Von was observed for un-fluorinated TFTs with shorter L , as shown in Figure 4a. Such TFT with the shortest L = 2 µ m has a Von of − 1.2 V, more negative than the near-zero Von for the long-channel TFTs with L = 10 and 100 µ m. The negative shift of Von for short- L TFTs has been attributed to a higher carrier concentration induced by donor-defects spilling into the channel region from the S/D regions (10). After a 5-min fluorination treatment, the Von of a L = 2 µm TFT was positively shifted to −0.5 V (Fig. 4b); with the addition of a non-oxidizing anneal before the 5-min fluorination treatment, the Von was further positively shifted to 0.2 V (Fig. 4c). The Von values of these three types of TFTs with different L are summarized in Figure 5. It can be seen clearly that the proposed process of IGZO:F TFT (IGZO+N 2 +F-5 min) lead to the realization of enhancement-mode TFTs with a positive Von even for a short-channel TFT with L = 2 µ m.\n\n[bool] has annot] one [b2029091] no vanda] snitud voliW , visebvird nanit vd 0684 spbs200101/pb I obtotldge oth ed bomo vog are solving VO tosn to solvi and Vrondi.

Shown in Figure 6 are the time-evolution of the transfer characteristics after being subjected to PBTS tests. Compared with un-fluorinated IGZO (Fig. 6a) and the reference IGZO:F (Fig. 6b) obtained using a conventional fluorination schedule, the addition of a non-oxidizing pre-anneal to the fluorination process in a IGZO:F TFT (Fig. 6c) led to the smallest negative shift in Von after a 3000-s PBTS test: the corresponding Von shifts were − 3.4 V (Fig. 6a), − 2.2 V (Fig. 6b), and\n−1.0 V (Fig. 6c) for these three types of TFTs. The improved stability is realized in the proposed process without the TFTs suffering from a loss of gate-control.\n\n![2_image_2.png](2_image_2.png)\n\n## Conclusion\n\n4.\n\nDifferent processes for the fluorination of IGZO TFTs have been investigated. The degradation resulting from a positive bias thermal stress on an IGZO TFT can be significantly suppressed by increasing the fluorination treatment time. However, furether extension of the fluorination time resulted in a loss of gate-control and higher gate leakage current, thus putting a cap on the fluorination time. Proposed presently is an alternative process of performing a non-oxidizing annealing of the IGZO film prior to the fluorination process. Further positive shifts of the turn-on voltage and improved reliability have been demonstrated without the TFT suffering degradation in other characteristics.\n\ncardid sellac) foll.w, gaseracing 0000 but annot, our 2000 (17002:9091)\n108 an solution VO tosn to solution virtualism (1906)\n\n## P-18 / S.

        "text": "# Reduction Of Drain-Current-Drop Phenomenon In Bce A-Igzo Tfts For 85-In. 8K 120Hz Goa Lcd\n\nZe-Ke Zheng*,*Shan Li*,Yu-Zhi Li*, Shi-Min Ge*, Cheng Gong*, Quan-Sheng Liu*,* \nWoosung Son*, Jun-Cheng Xiao*, Bin Zhao* \n*Shenzhen China Star Optoelectronics Technology Co., Ltd, Guangdong, China Abstract In order to avoid the drain current drop (DCD) issue in GOA circuits of Cu-process BCE a-IGZO 85inch 8K 120Hz LCD Displays, which causes the decrease of TFT electrical characteristics and poor transmission of gate signal, leading to the failure of GOA function, the mechanism and reduction of DCD effect through process optimization was studied in this paper. \n\n## Keywords\n\nDrain current drop; GOA; BCE a-IGZO TFT; 85inch 8K 120Hz 1. Introduction As the demand of low cost and narrow bezel for the large size and 8K resolution displays, gate driver on array (GOA) technology is widely used. Meanwhile, back channel etched (BCE) a-IGZO TFTs are prefer to be adopted for 8K 120Hz GOA LCD in industry, since the advantages of high mobility and low process cost.[1] However, the drain current drop phenomenon under high field strength brings great challenges to the electrical characteristics of BCE a-IGZOTFTs, which could lead to the failure of GOA function. However, there are few reports on the reduction of DCD phenomenon in IGZO TFTs, especially for the applications of large size 85-inch 8K LCD Displays that require higher stability for GOA function. In this paper, 85-inch 8K 120Hz GOA LCD panels based on BCE a-IGZO TFTs were fabricated. The mechanism of DCD in IGZO TFTs were studied. Relevant measures were implemented to solve the issue. \n\n## 2. Fabrication\n\nIn this work, the BCE a-IGZO TFTs for 85-inch 8K 120Hz GOA LCD were fabricated by a four-mask array process. Figure 1 shows the diagrammatic drawing of a BCE structure IGZO TFT with a PSVA display mode. Firstly, the Mo/Cu dual-layers were deposited on the glass with a size of 2500mm x 2200mm x 0.5mm (Gen 8.5 system) by PVD as the gate metal and patterned by the first mask. Then the SiNx/SiOx dual-layer gate insulators were deposited through PECVD, covering the gate metal. Amorphous IGZO film was deposited on the top of gate insulator by AC sputtering and Mo/Cu layers were then deposited as the S/D metal. The patterning of both IGZO and S/D metal layers were processed with one halftone mask. The SiOx passivation layer was then deposited by PECVD and RGB color filters were coated and patterned. Then polymer film as the planarization layer was coated and patterned. Finally, the pixel ITO electrode was sequentially processed by PVD, patterning and annealing. \n\nThe I-V characteristics and stress reliabilities of BCE a-IGZO \nTFTs were measured by Agilent B1505 precision semiconductor parameter analyzer or Keithley 4200. \n\n![0_image_0.png](0_image_0.png)\n\n## 3. Results And Discussion\n\nFigure 2 shows the picture of GOA function failure in an 85-inch 8K IGZO LCD panel, the issue occurs in the GOA area corresponding to the horizontal line in the panel, hereinafter referred to as issue area. The panel area below the horizontal line cannot display normally because the gate signal cannot be transmitted. Figure 3(a) shows the electrical characteristics of GOA TFTs in pull-up circuit, compare to the TFT in normal area, the Ion of GOA TFT in issue area is one order lower, which suggests that drain current drop (DCD) phenomenon occurs. Furthermore, Figure 3(b) shows the DCD stability of the GOA TFTs, in this case, the ID drops rapidly as soon as the VD exceeds the crit voltage of 48V (hereinafter referred to as DCD fail point). \n\n![0_image_1.png](0_image_1.png)\n\n![0_image_2.png](0_image_2.png)\n\ncaused by DCD phenomenon\nIn order to study the mechanism and main factors of DCD \nphenomenon, we firstly studied the active layer, which is the most critical in TFT structure and process. In the BCE a-IGZO process, due to the use of Cu metal, it is necessary to choose a proper Cu acid to etch the S/D metal layer, since it will also affect the composition of back channel and defect status of a-IGZO layer. \n\nFigure 4(a) shows the difference of DCD fail point on the BCE aIGZO TFTs (W/L=50um/6um,50um/8um,50um/10um) \nprocessed by 3 types of Cu etchants. The devices of Cu etchant A showed the poorest stability against DCD effect while the ones of Cu etchant C exhibited the highest DCD fail point. The main difference of these Cu etchants is the different etching characteristics of a-IGZO. Figure 4(b) shows the results of ICPAES (inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometer) \nmeasurements on the solution soaking a-IGZO on glass in Cu etchants. Cu etchant C shows the highest Zn2+ content in the soaked solution, which suggests the lowest content of Zn-O weak bond in the remain IGZO layer. Under high field strength, the generated hot carriers are momentarily accelerated by the concentrated electric field, breaking the Zn-O weak bond and forming trapping states [2], which could degrade the electron transport in a-IGZO and decrease the on-state drain current of TFTs.[3] What's more,as the channel length increases, the DCD \nstability improves, since the increased length of the conductive channel can reduce the field strength between the source and drain electrodes.[4] \nFigure 4. (a)The DCD fail point of the devices using Cu etchant type A/B/C;(b)The results of ICP-AES \nmeasurements on the solution soaking a-IGZO on glass in Cu etchant type A/B/C\nThe impact of process parameters of the passivation layer was also studied, which can induce trapping defects on the back channel surface of a-IGZO layer and influence the electrical properties of the BCE TFTs. Figure 5 shows the influence of the power and SiH4 flow rate during the CVD process of the passivation layer on the DCD fail point of BCD a-IGZO TFTs. With the decrease of CVD power of passivation layer, the damage on the back channel surface of a-IGZO layer reduces. In the meanwhile, the increase SiH4 flow rate can enhance the doping of H+,which is able to fill the defect states and reduce the trapping of electron, also improving the DCD stability of BCE a-IGZO TFTs. \n\n![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)\n\nAccording to the results above, we successfully fabricated the \n\n![1_image_1.png](1_image_1.png)\n\n![1_image_2.png](1_image_2.png)\n\nBCE a-IGZO 85-inch 8K 120Hz GOA LCD as showed in Figure 6, which was fabricated in the Gen 8.5 line. The reliable electrical characteristics of BCE a-IGZO TFTs without DCD phenomenon can ensure the normal function of GOA circuits and the long-term operation of the 85inch 8K 120Hz LCD panels. \n\n4. Conclusion In this work, researches were carried out on the reduction of DCD phenomenon in BCE a-IGZO TFTs by process optimization, especially for the applications of large size 85-inch 8K LCD Displays that require higher stability for GOA function. By studying the effect of Cu etchant and depositing condition of passivation layer on the a-IGZO active layer, we improved the DCD phenomenon from the material side and the process side at the same time, and successfully fabricated the BCE a-IGZO 85inch 8K GOA LCD. \n\n## 5.

Bruce Buchholz, and Robert P. H. Chang In memory of Arthur J. Freeman, a great advisor, mentor, and colleague Amorphous oxide semiconductors (AOSs)—ternary or quaternary oxides of post-transition metals such as In-Sn-O, Zn-Sn-O, or In-Ga-Zn-O—have been known for a decade and have attracted a great deal of attention as they possess several technological advantages, including low-temperature large-area deposition, mechanical flexibility, smooth surfaces, and high carrier mobility that is an order of magnitude larger than that of amorphous silicon (a-Si:H). Compared to their crystalline counterparts, the structure of AOSs is extremely sensitive to deposition conditions, stoichiometry, and composition, giving rise to a wide range of tunable optical and electrical properties. The large parameter space and the resulting complex deposition–structure–property relationships in AOSs make the currently available theoretical and experimental research data rather scattered and the design of new materials difficult. In this work, the key properties of several In-based AOSs are studied as a function of cooling rates, oxygen stoichiometry, cation composition, or lattice strain. Based on a thorough comparison of the results of ab initio modeling, comprehensive structural analysis, accurate property calculations, and systematic experimental measurements, a four-dimensional parameter space for AOSs is derived, serving as a solid foundation for property optimization in known AOSs and for design of next-generation transparent amorphous semiconductors.\n\n## 1.

Despite great technological demand for TCOs[4–20] and extensive experimental efforts to improve the conductivity via impurity doping,[21,22] to tune the work function and carrier concentration via cation composition,[23–28] to achieve two-dimensional transport via heterointerfaces,[29] and to p-dope the oxides toward active layers of transparent electronics,[30–32] theoretical understanding of these fascinating materials has lagged behind significantly. The first electronic band structure of ITO was calculated in 2001;[33] the role of native defects in prototype TCOs was understood after 2002;[34–\n37] the properties of multi-cation TCOs were first considered in 2004[37–42] followed by modeling of novel TCO hosts[43,44] and spin-dependent transport in transition-metal-doped TCOs;[45] the nature of the band gap in In2O3 was clarified in 2008;[46] and a first highthroughput search for p-type TCOs was performed in 2013.[47]\nComplex oxides that consist of multiple post-transition metals, such as InGaZnO4, have recently become competitive with silicon as the active transistor layer to drive arrays of pixels in large area displays.[9,13–19,24] As the billion-dollar display industry moves forward, the amorphous phase of the complex oxides is favored both for flexible and high-resolution display applications.[13–16,48–59] The unique properties of AOSs were first demonstrated in 1990,[60] and the research area has been growing exponentially since then. Unlike Si-based semiconductors, AOSs were shown to exhibit optical, electrical, thermal, and mechanical properties that are comparable or even superior to those possessed by their crystalline counterparts.[48–58] **Table** 1 summarizes the key physical properties of best-performing crystalline TCOs and AOSs; the differences (or the lack thereof) between the two will be discussed in detail in the respective sections below.\n\nMany fundamental aspects of AOSs have been addressed theoretically.

Although amorphous materials lack grain boundaries, the structural long-range disorder, as well as strong local distortions in the metal–oxygen (M–O) polyhedra, give rise to several new terms in the electron transport. Adhering to the Drude model, the electron mobility in an AOS can be represented with the following equation: where the contributions to the overall relaxation time are due to i) size and density of nanocrystalline inclusions; ii) spatial distribution and clustering of incorporated cations; iii) local point defects; iv) thermal vibrations; and v) piezoelectric effects associated with internal lattice strain. Clearly, the above classifications are figurative; the terms are likely to be intermixed for most AOS materials. For example, cation composition has a strong effect on the crystallization processes, defect formation, thermal properties, and can introduce significant lattice strain in amorphous structure. However, understanding the microscopic origins for each of the above terms via systematic investigations will help untangle the different contributions to the complex transport phenomena in AOSs.\n\nJulia E.

Whereas Si or Ge-based semiconductors or glasses like SiO2 from the main group metal oxides are covalent, the oxides of post-transition metals possess weaker metal–oxygen bonding, primarily ionic in nature. The strength of the M–O bonding determines the clarity of the local polyhedral structure. Strong local distortions in the M–O polyhedra in AOSs are not expected to affect the electron effective mass or the band gap—both should remain similar to the values in the corresponding crystalline counterparts.[39] On the other hand, the local distortions may affect the medium-range structure (e.g., edge or corner-sharing between the M–O polyhedra and their integration into an extended network) and facilitate the formation of structural defects that govern the degree of electron localization near the valence and conduction band edges and deep inside the band gap. Hence, instead of classical atomistic approaches commonly employed for modeling of glasses, quantum-mechanical molecular dynamics simulations combined with accurate densityfunctional calculations are required for AOSs in order to reliably describe the formation of both shallow and deep defects responsible for carrier generation and the charge transport limited by electron scattering and trapping. In addition, accurate characterization of the structural features beyond the first shell (i.e., \nbeyond the nearest neighbors) is necessary in order to explain the high sensitivity of the AOSs properties to the deposition[84]\nand post-deposition conditions,[64] particularly oxygen environment,[85] as well as the chemical composition of the sample.[67,86]\nIn this work, ab initio MD simulations and hybrid-functional DFT-based electronic structure calculations are performed i) to systematically study the local and medium-range structural characteristics of several prototype In-based oxides with different degree of amorphization, oxygen stoichiometry, cation composition, and/or lattice strain and ii) to connect the structural peculiarities to the resulting electronic, optical, or thermal properties of each material. Based on good agreement between the theoretically established trends and those observed experimentally, a unified model for prototype In-based AOS is proposed. The derived set of generic growth-structure-property relationships will help expedite the search for optimal preparation conditions—or those that ensure a desired set of properties—within the large parameter space of AOSs.\n\n## 2. Key Structural Properties Of Amorphous Indium Oxide\n\nTheoretically, the atomic structure of an amorphous material can be obtained using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In a liquid-quench approach, an initial crystalline structure is melted at a temperature well above the oxide melting point to remove the crystal structure memory and then rapidly quenched to a low temperature, usually to 100 K or below. Prior to optimization of the atomic coordinates within density functional theory (DFT) at 0 K, the quenched structure is equilibrated at room temperature to ensure that an energetically stable solution is reached. The electronic properties are then calculated for the DFT-optimized structure using local density approximation, generalized gradient approximation, or a hybrid functional approach for a more accurate description of the occupied and empty states.\n\nOur analysis begins from a prototype AOS structureundoped stoichiometric indium oxide. **Figure** 1 illustrates the pair correlation functions (PCFs) of 1) indium oxide melted at \n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)\n\n3000 K for 30 ps, 2) amorphous indium oxide quenched from the melt down to 100 K at a rate of 200 K/ps and then equilibrated at 300 K for 6 ps, and 3) crystalline In2O3 structure held at room temperature for 6 ps. In the amorphous state, only the first-shell peak that corresponds to the nearest In–O bonds, is clearly defined; at a longer range, all structural features are suppressed (Figure 1a). The latter highlights an important difference between an amorphous oxide semiconductor and a glass; for example, amorphous SiO2. As one can see from the atomic structure of amorphous SiO2 obtained using MD simulations with the same quench rates as for the amorphous indium oxide, Figure 1b and 1c, the tetrahedral coordination of Si is preserved in the glass phase—as signified by the narrow Si–O peak and a well-defined O–O peak in the distribution function. The firstshell metal–oxygen structure, that is, the Si–O distances, Si–O \ncoordination, and O–Si–O angles, inside the polyhedra closely correspond to those of the crystalline oxide. In marked contrast to a random arrangement of the regular SiO4 polyhedra, amorphous indium oxide features highly distorted InOx polyhedra: the O–O peak in PCF is suppressed (Figure 1a) and the average variance of the In–O distances at room temperature is 8.4 × 10−3 Å2—an order of magnitude larger than that in amorphous SiO2, 8.5 × 10−4 Å2. The large distortions in the local structure in the amorphous semiconductor originate from the weak, ionic bonding between oxygen atoms and the spherically symmetric s-orbitals of the post-transition metal. As a result, the average In–O coordination is reduced from 6.0 to 5.3 upon the crystalline-to-amorphous transition, and over 25% of the In atoms have a coordination of five or below (Figure 1e)—even in the perfectly stoichiometric case, that is, for the O/In ratio of 1.50.\n\nCombining the irregular InO polyhedra into a network determines the medium-range In–In structure. In bixbyite In2O3, the second and third shells of indium are associated with six In neighbors at 3.3 Å that share two oxygen atoms with the central In atom (i.e., the corresponding polyhedra are edge-shared) and six In neighbors at 3.8 Å that share one oxygen atom (cornershared polyhedra), respectively. In the amorphous phase, a significant number of edge-shared connections become cornershared (Figure 1d): out of the total number of all In–In pairs that share one, two, or three oxygen atoms, as much as 80% share only a single oxygen atom. The In–O–In angles for the corner-sharing connections vary from 95° to 160° (with the peak located at 115°). The corresponding distance distribution is nearly twice as wide as the corner-sharing distribution in the crystalline In2O3 and overlaps significantly with the distance distribution for the edge-shared In–In pairs (Figure 1d). \n\nConsequently, the two peaks in the In–In distribution are nearly indistinguishable and hard to resolve experimentally (i.e., the coordination number and Debye–Waller factor for the second and third shells cannot be uniquely fit). Yet, information regarding the In–In shells is essential for understanding the properties of AOSs: it has been shown that medium-range ordering plays a crucial role in the carrier transport of amorphous indium oxide[84] as discussed in the next section.\n\nAnother important structural peculiarity of the AOSs is the existence of non-shared InO polyhedra. In perfectly stoichiometric amorphous indium oxide, there is an appreciable number of the In–In pairs that do not share an oxygen atom \n\n![3_image_1.png](3_image_1.png)\n\n![3_image_2.png](3_image_2.png)\n\nalthough the two are located at a short distance from each \n\n![3_image_0.png](3_image_0.png) other, namely 3.4 - 4.6 Å (Figure 1d). As it will be shown below, the presence of such non-shared and often under-coordinate In atoms (and, similarly, the under-coordinate oxygen atoms; c.f., Figure 1e) leads to the formation of tail states near the oxide band edges.[87] These defect states may contribute to the optical absorption in the visible range (resulting in a negative bias illumination stress instability in AOS-based thin film transistors[88]) and limit carrier transport in AOSs.\n\n## 3. Properties Of Indium Oxide Across Crystalline To Amorphous Transition\n\nUpon transition from crystalline to amorphous phase, the structure of undoped indium oxide grown by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) using different substrate temperatures, Td, changes from 1) crystalline grains, Td = 600 °C, to 2) a multiphase mixture with the crystalline fraction decreasing linearly from 0.82 at Td = 200 °C to 0.36 at Td = 25 °C, and to 3) an amorphous material with no X-ray Bragg peaks below Td = 0 °C.[84]\nAccordingly, the transport regimes across the transition may be classified as band conductivity limited by grain boundaries (Hall mobility μ = 70 cm2 V−1 s−1 for Td > 400 °C); multiphase scattering/percolation (μ = 20–40 cm2 V−1 s−1 for Td =\n50–300 °C); and electron localization in the amorphous phase \n(μ = 20 cm2 V−1 s−1 for Td < –50 °C). Strikingly, however, when the crystalline fraction of In2O3 drops to zero at Td = 0 °C, the Hall carrier mobility reaches as much as 60 cm2 V−1 s−1, nearly the value measured in undoped crystalline In2O3.\n\n[84] Scattering alone cannot explain the observed mobility peak because: i) the size of nano-crystalline In2O3 inclusions observed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) decreases smoothly across the transition, from 2.2–3.4 nm at Td = 0 °C \nto 2.0–2.4 nm at Td = –50 °C,[84] and ii) the carrier concentration remains nearly constant, n = 2.7 - 3.2 × 1020 cm−3 (in samples grown with oxygen partial pressure of 8 mTorr[84]) for the deposition temperatures from –50 °C to +100 °C. Moreover, the average metal–oxygen and metal–metal distances vary insignificantly (< 2%) upon the crystalline-amorphous transition and cannot explain the mobility changes.[84]\nA thorough systematic comparison of the local structural characteristics of the amorphous indium oxide obtained from extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements and from ab initio MD liquid-quench simulations has shown that the major differences occur in the second and third indium shells,[84] with the number of the edge-sharing InO polyhedra being greatly diminished in the amorphous phase; c.f., Figure 1d. The local structure evolved as a function of deposition temperature in the case of the films analyzed by EXAFS and as a function of quench rate in the case of MD simulations. A striking agreement was observed between the structural trends observed by EXAFS as a function of deposition temperature and the structural trends observed for MD \nsimulations as a function of quench rate. Based on the excellent agreement between the measured and simulated structures, the experimental deposition temperature scale (Td = 25 °C to \n–100 °C) was aligned with the MD quench rate scale (5–700 K \nps−1).[84] Further look into the theoretical atomistic structures \n\n![4_image_0.png](4_image_0.png)\n\nobtained at different quench rates reveals that the spatial distribution of the indium atoms with octahedral coordination; that is, the six- fold coordination with oxygen atoms, varies from 1) clusters of InO 6 polyhedra with short-distant edge-sharing fraction reaching 50% (same as in crystalline In 2 O 3 ) in the amorphous structures obtained using slow quench rates, to 2) chains of InO 6 polyhedra primarily connected via long-distant corner-sharing in structures quenched with intermediate rates, and to 3) a random distribution of disconnected InO 6 polyhedra in the most amorphous structures (quench rates 400 K ps − 1 and above; Figure 2). Although slower cooling rates\n(K ns − 1 ) would be required to describe the crystallization process ( T a > 50 °C), ab initio MD simulations are able to capture the important structural variations that occur during the transition into the amorphous state. We believe that the clustering of the InO 6 polyhedra found in the amorphous structures upon slow quenching (Figure 2b), corresponds to the initial nucleation of the In 2 O 3 nanocrystallites that have been observed using HR-TEM. 1841 As the deposition temperature changes from T a = 0 °C to T a = 150 °C, the size of the nanocrystallites increases and the scattering-limited mobility decreases from 60 cm 2 V 21 s −1 to 20 cm 2 V 21 s −1 , respectively. When the crystalline fraction exceeds 80% ( T a > 200 °C), the carrier mobility begins to increase toward the value of the crystal.\n\nThus, the three-fold increase in the mobility (in samples deposited at T d = 0 °C) is attributed to the formation of cornershared InO 6 polyhedra chains (in structures obtained at MD\nquench rate of 200 K ps –1 ). Accurate density-functional electronic band structure calculations of the oxides with different degree of amorphization (cooling rates 5 - 700 K ps –1 ) help determine the conductivity mechanisms below the crystallineamorphous transition. The calculated density of states (DOS)\nfor the structures obtained with the rates of 50 - 250 K ps –1 features two peaks with a clear gap at the Fermi level (Figure 2c).\n\nThe gap, known as a Coulomb gap,[89] separates the occupied and empty states and signifies that the electron–electron interactions (a Coulomb blockade) result in the electron localization in a particular state below the Fermi level, while the empty state above E F is available for the electron to hop through—once the temperature is high enough. The charge density distribution calculated for the energy ranges that correspond to the two states, clearly illustrates that the electron is localized along a chain in a particular direction, whereas the empty, conduction path runs in a different (perpendicular) direction. Importantly, both chains are formed by low- coordinate under- shared InO polyhedra, and in both cases the charge avoids the indium atoms with octahedral coordination, that is, those that reach their natural coordination of 6 (Figure 2d and e). This suggests the long- range formation of the connected InO 6 polyhedra leads to oxygen depletion in the areas adjacent to the chains and the charge is localized in the oxygen-depleted regions.\n\nAbove and below the mobility maximum, that is, for slower\n(5 K ps − 1 ) or faster-quenched (300 K ps − 1 ) amorphous structures, the Coulomb gap softens as the two states overlap resulting in a nonzero DOS (Figure 2c). This occurs due to a weaker electron repulsion caused by structural reorganization:\nthe long- range structural correlations, that is, the InO 6 chains, are suppressed by the increased disorder below the mobility peak, whereas above the peak, the additional energy (higher Td ) leads to the formation of short-distant edge-shared InO 6 clusters. Finally, in the structures obtained with the quench rates above 500 K ps−1, the two-state structure completely disappears and a single localized state is formed in the DOS—as should be expected for the most disordered structures.\n\nTwo important points must be made here. First, we stress that the specific direction of the InO6 chain in our calculations does not carry any meaning and is pertinent to the particular realization. MD simulations under identical conditions \n(quench rates) or with a larger/smaller supercell (while keeping the same O/M ratio) were found to result to different atomic configuration; nonetheless, the outcome properties—a chain of InO6 polyhedra in the structure and a Coulomb gap in the density of states—were preserved in each case. In a real sample of indium oxide, multiple InO6 chains of various lengths and orientations are expected to coexist, all contributing to overall enhancement of the carrier mobility.\n\nSecond, the medium-range structural correlations in amorphous oxides are likely to be highly sensitive to deposition and post-deposition conditions (temperature, time, and ambient), film thickness, as well as to cation composition since all the above may have a strong effect on the In coordination and the spatial distribution of the differently coordinated InO \npolyhedra. In the next sections, the results of thorough theoretical investigations are shown to provide important insights into the role of oxygen content (Section 5), cation composition (Section 6), and lattice strain (Section 7) on the local and medium-range structure of AOSs.\n\nHere, we give an example of how film thickness affects the mobility behavior. In 350–450 nm and 850–1050 nm thick films of (ZnO)0.15 (In2O3)0.70 (SnO2)0.15 (or ZITO) grown by PLD at an oxygen partial pressure of 8 mTorr, the measured Hall mobility reaches the maximum value of 50 cm2 V−1 s−1 at the deposition temperature of Td = 150 °C, at which both oxide films are X-ray amorphous. However, the shape of the μ(Td) curve differs between the two films. In the thinner film, the mobility drops to 35 cm2 V−1 s−1 at Td = 100 °C and to 20 cm2 V−1 s−1 at Td =\n300 °C, illustrating that the multi-cation composition broadens the μ(Td) curve as compared to the sharp mobility peak in amorphous indium oxide (see Supporting Information; the role of cation composition in ternary In-based oxides is discussed in more detail in Section 6). In the thicker film, the mobility dependence on the deposition temperature is even weaker: the mobility is equal to 30–32 cm2 V−1 s−1 at Td = –25 °C and at Td = 300 °C and it nearly plateaus above and below the peak value, namely from 100 °C to 200 °C (see Supporting Information). Clearly, the film thickness affects the formation and/\nor distribution of the InO6 chains, opening up a possibility to tune the mobility behavior of AOSs for a specific technological application.\n\n## 4. Carrier Generation And Defect Formation In Aoss\n\nThe key features of the electronic band structure of a transparent conducting oxide host—a wide optical band gap and a single highly-dispersed conduction band—originate from the metal–oxygen interactions.[90] Since the local structure; that is, the M–O distances and coordination, remains nearly intact \n\n![5_image_1.png](5_image_1.png)\n\nupon amorphization,[84] the band gap and the electron effective \n\n![5_image_0.png](5_image_0.png)\n\nmass of an AOS should deviate insignificantly from the corresponding crystalline values. Indeed, in the stoichiometric amorphous indium oxide, a-In2O3.00, the delocalized nature of the conduction band formed from the M-s–O-p states is preserved under the structural transition, **Figure** 3, so that the calculated supercell electron effective mass, 0.20 me, is nearly identical to that in the crystalline In2O3, 0.22 me. However, owing to the wide distribution of the In–O coordination numbers in the amorphous state (Figure 1e), the charge density distribution calculated for the empty conduction band is not uniform: a notable charge density accumulation is found in the interstitial area between several under-coordinate In atoms, Figure 3d–f: \nthe charge originates at the In atom with the lowest coordination number (CN = 4.4), and spills toward its In neighbors that are also under-coordinated (CN = 4.8). Low coordination numbers imply that the corresponding InO polyhedra are likely to be under-shared—owing to the lack of oxygen atoms in the vicinity. In the cluster of the under-coordinate indium atoms, the shortest In–In distance (3.3 Å) corresponds to an edge-sharing connection as expected (c.f., Figure 1d), while the other two In–In pairs are under-shared: the In atoms located at 3.5 Å from each other, share a corner (although there are edgeshared In–In pairs at this distance; Figure 1d) and the In–In pair at 3.8 Å does not share an oxygen atom. The close proximity of several under-coordinate under-shared In atoms indicates the onset of the medium-range correlations discussed in the previous section, and the charge density redistribution in the empty conduction band of the stoichiometric amorphous indium oxide is in accord with the well-defined conduction paths shown in Figure 2d and e.\n\nIn contrast to the conduction states that remain delocalized in the stoichiometric amorphous indium oxide, the structural disorder reveals itself in the appearance of strongly localized states near the top of the valence band (Figure 3a). These tail states[73,75,87,91] originate from the charge localization at undercoordinate oxygen atoms (with a coordination number 3 or below; c.f., Figure 1e) and contribute to the optical absorption within the visible range, that is, at 2–3 eV (Figure 3c). The degree of localization and the energy location of the tail states with respect to the valence band edge depends strongly on the oxygen/metal ratio (as discussed in more details later in this section) and on the cation composition (see Section 5.4).\n\nSimilar to undoped TCOs, carriers in AOSs are introduced in materials grown under oxygen-reduced conditions. In amorphous indium oxide grown by PLD at Td = –25 °C with the oxygen partial pressure varied from 1 mTorr to 16 mTorr during the deposition, the carrier concentration increases linearly with decreasing p(O2), achieving n = 5 × 1020 cm−3 (**Figure** 4). Ab initio MD simulations of non-stoichiometric indium oxide, a-In2O2.96, reveal a rigid-band-like shift of the Fermi level: the occupied states at the bottom of the conduction band and in the vicinity of the Fermi level remain delocalized—in accordance with the unchanged mobility for the samples grown with p(O2) = 8–16 mTorr, μ = 50 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Figure 4a). The charge density distribution calculated for the partially occupied conduction band shows a weak electron localization in the area surrounded by under-shared In atoms (Figure 3e). Similar to the stoichiometric case, the charge originates at an under-coordinate \n\n![6_image_0.png](6_image_0.png)\n\nIn (the coordination number is 4.5) and spills toward two In neighbors located at 3.1 Å and 4.0 Å from the under-coordinate In atom. Such In–In distances correspond to face- and cornersharing (c.f., Figure 1d); however, the respective In atoms share only two and no oxygen atoms, respectively. Structurally, the \"void\" between the three under-shared low-coordinate In atoms (Figure 3d and e) resembles an oxygen vacancy in a crystalline oxide where three or four metal atoms also lose sharing when the defect is introduced; a conceptual analogy with charged oxygen vacancy defects has also been suggested for amorphous oxides.[55] From the electronic structure point of view, however, we argue that the crystalline and amorphous oxides are fundamentally contradistinctive: owing to the many degrees of freedom of the amorphous structure and its ability to accommodate an oxygen \"vacancy\" by structural relaxation beyond the next-nearest neighbors, the under-shared In defect represents a shallow donor state in a-In2O2.96.\n\nUpon the degenerate doping of the non-stoichiometric amorphous indium oxide, the optical band gap broadens (due to Burstein–Moss shift) and the material becomes transparent within the entire visible region (Figure 3c). Further decrease of the oxygen content in amorphous indium oxide leads to the formation of a strongly localized state in the band gap. For a-In2O2.92, a deep defect is formed at about 1.2 eV below the Fermi level (Figure 3a); the charge density distribution calculated for the defect state reveals that the strong localization occurs between two under-coordinate In atoms (the coordination numbers are 3.8 and 3.9) that do not share an oxygen atom between them—despite being located at a short distance of 2.7 Å (that is comparable to the metallic In–In distance in the elemental In crystal; Figure 3f). The strong electron localization between the under-coordinate under-shared In atoms in the oxygen-deficient amorphous oxides is expected to limit the carrier mobility due to charge scattering; indeed, the measured Hall mobility is suppressed to 10 cm2 V−1 s−1 at p(O2) = 1 mTorr \n(Figure 4a). In addition to the detrimental effect on the carrier transport, the deep defects contribute to optical absorption \n(Figure 3c), reducing the optical transmission within the visible range and being responsible for darker coloration of the AOSs samples.\n\nThe role of the [Oxygen]/[Metal] ratio in the formation of both the valence and conduction defect states is summarized in Figure 4b. In the perfectly stoichiometric case; that is, when [O]/[In] = 1.50 in the undoped indium oxide, most of the In atoms have high coordination with oxygen atoms and most of the InO polyhedra are shared according to the corresponding In-In distances, namely, edge-shared for dIn–In ≈ 3.4 Å and corner-shared for dIn–In ≈ 3.7 Å. All deviations in the coordination numbers or polyhedra sharing are absorbed by the amorphous structure via local polyhedral distortions and the MO network reorganization; as a result, the conduction band is empty. \n\nWhen the [O]/[M] ratio decreases below the stoichiometric value, the number of under-coordinate metal atoms increases; clustering of such under-coordinate In atoms into a group of under-shared polyhedra leads to the formation of an oxygendepleted area that structurally is similar to the In–O features around an oxygen vacancy in the crystalline oxides. Electronically, the defect corresponds to a shallow electron donor and, in marked contrast to the crystalline oxides, exhibits very weak electron localization—owing to the ability of the amorphous \n\n![7_image_0.png](7_image_0.png)\n\nFigure 4. Electrical properties and defect formation in amorphous indium oxide. a) Experimental Hall mobility, carrier concentration, conductivity, and excess collision frequency (see Supporting Information) in amorphous indium oxide films of 270–390 nm thickness grown by PLD at deposition temperature Td = –25 °C as a function of oxygen partial pressure. b) Summary of the structural peculiarities and the resulting electronic features near the valence and conduction band edges for AOSs as a function of variable [Oxygen]/[Metal] ratio.\n\nstructure to reduce the charge imbalance via a long-range structural relaxation around the defect. The theoretical predictions of weak electron scattering in marginally under-stoichiometric amorphous oxides are corroborated by our experimental observations of the constant carrier mobility for the samples grown with the O2 pressures of 8–16 mTorr as well as the low excess collision frequency (see Supporting Information) within this p(O2) range (Figure 4a).\n\nThe number of free carriers continues to steadily increase at lower oxygen content; at the same time, indium atoms with very low coordination may pair up forming short-distant metal–\nmetal bonds—provided that there are no oxygen atoms available to be shared between these low-coordinate In atoms. The strongly localized defects associated with a trapped electron at the M–M bond, appear below the conduction band edgeonce the [O]/[M] ratio is smaller than a certain compositionspecific threshold. For undoped indium oxide, the threshold corresponds to theoretical oxygen stoichiometry In2O3–δ with δ = 0.08 in the structures simulated with MD quench rate of 200 K ps−1 and to experimental p(O2) = 7 mTorr in PLD-grown samples of 270–380 nm thickness deposited at Td = –25 °C. It is important to stress that the deposition technique and conditions as well as the cation composition are expected to have a significant effect on the defect formation in AOSs. In addition, post-deposition annealing is an effective tool to improve the carrier mobility in AOSs since the extra energy due to heating allows the amorphous network to reorganize (e.g., via oxygen diffusion) in order to better accommodate the irregular charge density distribution and, hence, to suppress the strongly localized defects.\n\nThe formation of tail states near the top of the valence band associated with under-coordinate oxygen atoms[87] is also governed by the [O]/[M] ratio. For the three amorphous structures of indium oxide; that is, the perfectly stoichiometric In2O3 as well as In2O2.96 and In2O2.92 (Figure 3a), the localization of the tail states decreases with increased oxygen stoichiometryan opposite trend to the localization of the conduction band defects. Indeed, at larger [O]/[M] ratios, the increased number of fully coordinate metal atoms screens an under-coordinate oxygen defect more effectively, leading to a stronger localization of the corresponding tail states above the valence band edge.\n\nThus, the formation of both the valence and conduction band defects is intrinsically interconnected (Figure 4b); tuning the [O]/[M] ratio that governs the defect concentration as well as the degree of localization of the defects will ensure an optimal electrical and optical performance in AOSs.\n\n## 5. Role Of Cation Composition In Structure And Properties Of Aoss 5.1. Local Structure And Amorphization Efficiency\n\nIn multicomponent AOSs, two or more binary oxides are mixed during the deposition to facilitate the formation of an amorphous state at room temperature. As expected, structural disorder increases with the substitution level in ternary and quaternary AOSs; however, there is no clear understanding regarding the role played by the individual metal species in the formation of amorphous state and the AOSs properties. Most research has focused on quaternary oxides such as a-In-Ga-Zn-O or a-Zn-In-Sn-O given their technological appeal;[48,49,51–57,62–66,68,69,73,74,76] only a few studies addressed the properties of ternary AOSs systematically.[67,85,86] Moreover, a comparison of the results available in the literature is likely to be inconclusive because the crystallization temperature depends strongly not only on the metal composition but also on growth conditions (such as oxygen partial pressure, postdeposition temperatures and times) as well as film thickness.\n\nTo understand the underlying microscopic mechanisms that govern the amorphization process in post-transition metal oxides, the local and medium-range structural features of amorphous In–X–O with 20% fractional substitution of X = Ga, Zn, or Sn (labeled a-IGO, a-IZO, or a-ITO hereafter) are systematically compared to those in amorphous indium oxide (a-IO). All structures were obtained from ab initio MD simulations with the same quench rate of 200 K ps−1 and the same oxygen stoichiometry; namely, (In2O2.96)22(Ga2O3)5, (In2O2.96)22(ZnO)10, and (In2O2.96)22(SnO2)10, which was set in all structures prior to quenching. It is found that the addition of Ga2O3, ZnO, or SnO2 into the indium oxide host i) increases the local distortions of the InO polyhedra as signified by a larger variance for the first-shell In-O distances, 1.07 × 10−2 Å2, 1.05 × 10−2 Å2, or 1.24 × 10−2 Å2 in a-IGO, a-IZO, or a-ITO, respectively—as compared to σ2 = 8.42 × 10−3 Å2 in amorphous indium oxide; and ii) suppresses the number of high-coordinate In atoms (the effective coordination number 5.5 or above) from 44% in amorphous indium oxide to 23% in a-IGO and a-ITO and to 9% in a-IZO (note that a single amorphous structure from an MD simulation at 300 K or from a DFT-optimized solution at 0 K tend to overestimate the In–O coordination in a–In–X–O with X = Ga or Zn as compared to amorphous indium oxide[92,93]\nin contrast to the time average presented here). The smallest amount of the fully coordinate In atoms in a-IZO is in accord with the highest crystallization temperature measured experimentally in In-Zn-O with 10% of zinc; namely, 630 °C. For comparison, the crystallization temperature; that is, the temperature at which the bixbyite In2O3 fraction exceeds 80%, is measured to be 120 °C in undoped amorphous indium oxide, 450 °C for 20% of Ga substitution, and only 160 °C for 10% of Tin, all grown by PLD under the same oxygen pressure of 8 mTorr.\n\nThe experimental trend in the crystallization temperature \n(Tcryst(ITO) << Tcryst(IGO) < Tcryst(IZO)) cannot be explained by the aforementioned changes in the local first-shell In–O structure alone. One needs to look at the local structure of the XO \npolyhedra, although the Tcryst trend does not appear to directly correlate with the strength of the metal–oxygen bond of the added metal (Sn–O < Zn–O << Ga–O). The results of our MD simulations for amorphous In–X–O provide the following insights: i) In marked contrast to the under-coordinated In atoms, the majority of the X cations attain their natural coordination; that is, the coordination in the corresponding crystalline binary or ternary oxides; namely, 4 for Zn, 6 for Sn, and 4, 5 or 6 for Ga (**Figure** 5). ii) At room temperature, the oxygen coordination is \"frozen\" for most of the X cations: the coordination variance averaged over the MD time period of 6 ps is 0.07 for Ga atoms, 0.06 for Sn, and 0.11 for Zn at 300 K. These values are notably smaller than the average variance for the In coordination; namely, 0.14 in a-IGO or a-IZO and 0.15 in a-ITO, also calculated at 300 K. iii) Most importantly, the X cations behave differently once the temperature is increased (Figure 5b), in contrast to Tin atoms, where the calculated coordination variance remains small even at 500 K; namely ≤0.11, the average variance in the Zn–O coordination is almost two times larger, \n\n![8_image_1.png](8_image_1.png)\n\n0.19 at 500 K. For Ga atoms, the average coordination variance \n\n![8_image_0.png](8_image_0.png)\n\nis 0.16 at 500 K, making the trend in the calculated coordination variance (Sn–O in ITO < Ga–O in IGO < Zn–O in IZO) \nto be in accord with the observed crystallization temperature in In–X–O for X = Sn, Ga, and Zn. The large deviations in the coordination of particular Ga or Zn atoms at high temperature arise from the ability of these cations to adopt to several oxygen environments. Specifically, while Zn atoms are 4-coordinate in wurtzite ZnO and Ga atoms are 4 and 6-coordinate in monoclinic β-Ga2O3, both are 5-coordinate in crystalline InGaZnO4.\n\n[40] Thus, the large deviations in the Ga–O and Zn–O \ncoordination associated with the multi-coordinate nature of these cations, along with the ability of the host atoms to easily adjust to a changing oxygen environment, help maintain the disorder in these In-based AOSs at high temperatures.\n\nAnother important factor governing the amorphization process is the medium-range structural preferences of the added metal atoms; that is, sharing of the XO polyhedra and the resulting spatial distribution of differently coordinated InO \nand XO polyhedra. In accord with the observed low effectiveness of tin to amorphize indium oxide structure, the number and the distribution of edge- and corner-shared MO polyhedra obtained from MD simulations deviates insignificantly from those in undoped amorphous indium oxide (Figure 5c). This finding stems from the similarities in the electronic configuration, ionic size, and oxygen coordination preferences of Sn and In cations. Moreover, the majority (over 60%) of the introduced edge-shared connections with short M–M distances, 3.0–3.2 Å (Figure 5c) involve Sn atoms. This result signifies that tin has a tendency to promote clustering, especially at high concentration of Sn (that also limits the carrier mobility of a-ITO,[93] as discussed in Section 5.3 below). In marked contrast to Sn, the addition of both Ga and Zn not only suppresses the edge-sharing peak in the M–M distribution, but also leads to a much broader range of the corner-shared M–M pairs. As a result, the edge- and corner-sharing peaks overlap completely (Figure 5c), suggesting that the medium-range disorder in a-IZO and a-IGO increases as compared to that in a-IO and a-ITO. Experimentally, the second and third shells cannot be fitted in this case; the corresponding structures are often called EXAFS-free amorphous.[67] Last but not least, an internal strain introduced by the presence of additional cations may also affect amorphization. A systematic experimental and theoretical study of the amorphous indium oxide doped with group III metals, Sc, Y, and La, showed that the amorphization efficiency increases with the size of the ionic radius of the substituted cation.[67] The local structure comparison of the amorphous In–X–O with 20% substitution of X = Sc, Y, or La have revealed that scandium is too small to suppress the amount of InO6 polyhedra and to prevent their clustering, whereas lanthanum is large enough to make the In–La–O samples fully X-ray amorphous—even with only 5% La doping in films processed at 300 °C.[67]\nWhile a theoretical calculation of the crystallization temperature in a-In–X–O is beyond the scope of this work, the above results of the MD liquid-quench simulations clearly illustrate that complex interplay between the local and medium-range structural preferences of both the host and the substitution metals must be taken into account in the search for efficient amorphizers.\n\n![9_image_0.png](9_image_0.png)\n\n## 5.2. Carrier Generation In Multi-Cation Aoss\n\nOne of the major differences between the multi-cation crystalline and amorphous oxide semiconductors concerns carrier generation. In striking contrast to crystalline TCOs where external aliovalent doping is the most viable way to generate free carriers and to control the carrier concentration over a wide range (from 1017 to 1021 cm−3), additional cations in AOSs do not act as carrier donors or acceptors. This is evident from the following: i) for amorphous In–X–O with as much as 30% substitution of X = Ga, Zn, or Sn, grown by PLD \nusing a deposition temperature of Td = –25 °C and an oxygen partial pressure of 8 mTorr, the measured carrier concentration, n = 0.8 × 1020 cm−3, 1.2 × 1020 cm−3, or 1.6 × 1020 cm−3, respectively, is similar or, in the case of a-ITO, identical to that in undoped amorphous indium oxide grown under the same deposition conditions, n = 1.6 × 1020 cm−3;\n[93] and ii) our calculated electronic band structure of stoichiometric amorphous ternary In–X–O or quaternary In–Ga–Zn–O, Zn–In–Sn–O, etc, oxides corresponds to an insulator—independent of the level of fractional substitution and the valence of added cation(s) with respect to the valence of the host cation.\n\nThe fact that aliovalent cation(s) in In-based AOSs do not serve as free electron dopants stems from an ability of the cations to attain their preferred local oxygen environment—an advantage provided by the amorphous structure with many degrees of freedom. A structural analysis of amorphous In–X–O with 20% of X = Ga, Sn, or Zn obtained using ab initio MD simulations, shows that the XO polyhedra are highly distorted—as signified by the average variance of the first-shell X–O distances, namely, 1.89 × 10−2 Å2, 0.91 × 10−2 Å2, or 1.34 × 10−2 Å2 in a-IGO, a-ITO or a-IZO, respectively, being comparable to those for the In–O distances in these ternary structures, σ2 = 1.1 - 1.2 × 10−2 Å2. Despite the strong local distortions, the X cations tend to have high coordination with oxygen atoms: as mentioned in the previous section, most of the X atoms attain their natural coordination; that is, the one found in the corresponding crystalline binary (4 for Zn; 6 for Sn; and 4 or 6 for Ga, as in monoclinic β-Ga2O3) or multi-cation oxides (for example, both Ga and Zn have 5-fold coordination with oxygen in crystalline InGaZnO4). In a-In–X–O with 20% \nof X = Ga, Sn, or Zn, the majority of Zn and Sn atoms are four and six coordinated, respectively (Figure 5). In a-IGO, about two thirds of the Ga atoms are four coordinate, while the coordination of the rest of the Ga atoms is equally distributed between above 4.0 and below 5.0 (Figure 5). Similarly, it has been found that adding 20% of GeO2, Sc2O3, Y2O3, or La2O3 into indium oxide melt, resulted in Ge, Sc, Y, or La reaching their natural coordination upon the MD quenching of the amorphous oxides.[92] The fulfilled coordination with oxygen atoms is in accord with the stronger bonding between the oxygen and the added metal species with respect to that of the host metal; that is, the In–O bonds.\n\nIn contrast to the fully coordinate minority cations in the amorphous In–X–O, the average coordination of indium is reduced from 5.3 in a-IO to 5.1 in a-IGO and to 5.0 in a-ITO and a-IZO. The presence of X leads to an increased number of low-coordinate In atoms (with the coordination number 5.0 or below) as compared to that in amorphous indium oxide; moreover, for many of the indium atoms the coordination varies by as much as 2, for example, between 4 and 6, within a 6 ps time period at room temperature. The electronic structure calculations of non-stoichiometric amorphous In–X–O (with oxygen stoichiometry similar to that considered in a-In2O2.96; c.f., \nFigure 3a–f) confirm that indium remains to serve as the main source of donor defects upon fractional substitution with X. The calculated charge density distribution in the partially occupied conduction band reveals that among all possible metal–metal nearest neighbor pairs, the largest charge value belongs to two In atoms that are under-shared and have low-coordination with oxygen atoms: for all three compositions considered; that is, for In–X–O with X = Ga, Sn, or Zn, the coordination number for both In atoms is 4.6 - 4.8, the In–In distance is 3.2 - 3.4 Å, and the two indium atoms are corner shared; that is, missing the second oxygen atom the two are supposed to share at this separation typical of edge-shared polyhedra. These structural features of the oxygen-depleted region resulting in a notable conduction charge accumulation in amorphous In–X–O, are similar to those found in undoped amorphous indium oxide at the same oxygen stoichiometry (see Section 4 and Figure 3a–f).\n\nImportantly, our theoretical results support the weak dependence of the experimental carrier concentration on the composition in amorphous ternary In-based oxides.[93] The electronic structure calculations for the amorphous non-stoichiometric In–X–O with 20% of X show that the cation composition has little effect on the conduction states below the Fermi level and on the free carrier concentration: i) similar to a-IO (Figure 3), the defect state remains to be shallow as seen from the low value of the inverse participation ratio for the occupied states in the conduction band of amorphous In–X–O (**Figure** 6); and ii) the Burstein–Moss (BM) shift; that is, the Fermi level shift into the conduction band, is 1.40 eV in a-ITO, 1.46 eV in a-IGO, and 1.51 eV in a-IZO, that is only slightly smaller than the shift in a-IO, 1.61 eV, with the same oxygen stoichiometry. Moreover, additional calculations for an amorphous structure with larger Ga fraction, In1.2Ga0.8O2.96, where a BM shift of 1.55 eV \nand a shallow donor state are obtained, further illustrate the weak dependence of the number of free carriers on the cation composition in AOSs with high oxygen stoichiometry (> 2.96). Understanding the role of composition in the formation of deep defects in multi-cation In-based amorphous oxides with lower oxygen content (oxygen stoichiometry < 2.96) is a next step and will be discussed elsewhere.\n\n## 5.3. Electron Localization And Carrier Mobility\n\nAlthough the presence of additional cations in In-based AOSs does not govern the free carrier generation, compositioninduced differences in the oxygen-sharing and medium-range spatial distribution of the differently coordinate InO and XO polyhedra affect the carrier mobility. First of all, in contrast to the undoped indium oxide where a three-fold change in the Hall mobility is observed above and below the transition to a fully amorphous state, as described in Section 3 above, the mobility in In–X–O is expected to have a weaker dependence on the deposition temperature—owing to the suppressed amount of the InO6 polyhedra in the ternary oxides \n(Figure 5a) and, hence, a decreased probability of InO6 chain \n\n![10_image_1.png](10_image_1.png)\n\nformation (see Section 3 and Figure 2b). From experimental \n\n![10_image_0.png](10_image_0.png)\n\nobservations, for IZO with 15% ZnO grown at an oxygen partial pressure of 8 mTorr, the mobility stays at 60 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the deposition temperatures Td = 25 °C, 100 °C, and 200 °C. \n\nOnce the crystalline fraction starts to increase (above 200 °C), \nthe mobility gradually drops to 30 cm2 V−1 s−1 at Td = 400 °C. \n\nAn even weaker dependence of the carrier mobility on the deposition temperature is found in ITO with 15% SnO2: the mobility varies within 40 - 50 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the deposition temperatures –25 °C, 25 °C, 50 °C, 100 °C, and 200 °C; that is, well below and above the transition to fully amorphous state with no X-ray peaks observed at Td = 50 °C and below. From a technological point of view, a wider range of the deposition temperatures for which the mobility is maintained, makes the multi-cation AOSs more appealing as compared to undoped amorphous indium oxide.\n\nWhen the substitutional doping level in multicomponent AOSs increases, clustering of fully coordinate X cations leads to a non-uniform charge density distribution for the conduction states and, therefore, to a variable range hopping[94] through the states of different energy. Accurate DFT-based hybrid-functional calculations of amorphous In–X–O with 20% fractional substitution of X = Ga, Zn, or Sn, reveal that the localization above the Fermi level is strongest in In–Ga–O, followed by In–Sn–O, In–Zn–O, and then In–O—in excellent agreement with the observed trend of the Hall carrier mobility measured as a function of fractional substitution (0 - 30%) in amorphous In–X–O \n(Figure 6c). The calculated charge density distribution for the energy slice of 0.5 eV above the Fermi level (unoccupied states) illustrates (Figure 6b) that an extra free electron is likely to get trapped at the under-coordinate In atom surrounded by three Ga atoms, all of which have their coordination fully satisfied. Similar to the a-IO case where the electron density near the Fermi level avoids the six-coordinate InO6 (c.f., Figure 2d and e), \nthe empty states of the four-coordinate Ga atoms have a higher energy and, hence, are not available for the conduction electron to propagate.\n\nTo further understand the role of different cation species in carrier transport of amorphous In–X–O, the conduction charge density (for the unoccupied states within 0.5 eV above the Fermi level) is calculated along all metal–metal nearest neighbors and the results are compared for In–In, In–X, X–In and X–X pairs in each structure. It is found that, independent of doping, the average charge density values for the In–In neighbors are nearly identical for X = Ga, Sn, and Zn, whereas the contributions from X–In and X–X pairs are cation-specific: on average, the charge density is large near Sn atoms (slightly larger than that for In–In neighbors), almost two times smaller near Zn, and even smaller near Ga (Figure 6d). The non-uniform charge density distribution in the conduction states of multi-cation AOSs is associated with i) different strength of the metal–oxygen bonds; ii) different M–O coordination and the degree of local distortions in the MO polyhedra; as well as iii) spatial distribution of the MO polyhedra, e.g., clustering of GaOx vs. chain formation of InO6–SnO6 vs. random distribution of ZnO4.\n\n[93] All the above local and medium-range structural features ultimately determine the energy profile of the conduction states and are responsible for the complex nature of the carrier mobility in multicomponent AOSs.\n\n![11_image_0.png](11_image_0.png)\n\n## 5.4. Tail States And Optical Band Gap As A Function Of Composition\n\nFrom a technological point of view, the wide range of fractional compositions in ternary and quaternary AOSs is highly appealing for tuning the optical band gap and work function in these multifunctional materials.[95,96] First, the effect of cation composition on the tail states near the top of the valence band of AOSs is generalized.[73] As mentioned in Section 4, a strongly localized state is formed when an under-coordinate oxygen atom is surrounded by fully-coordinate metal atoms resulting in a charge imbalance. In amorphous In–X–O with 20% of X = Ga, Zn, or Sn, the number of under-coordinate oxygen atoms increases as compared to undoped amorphous indium oxide (c.f., Figure 3a)—and so does the electron localization at the defect states near the valence band maximum \n(Figure 6c). With over 30% of three-coordinate oxygen atoms in a-In–Sn–O, the localization of the tail states is the strongest in this case. As shown in Section 4, the tail states contribute to the optical absorption at 2–3 eV for stoichiometric a-IO (Figure 3c). \n\nWhen the [O]/[M] ratio is reduced, the number of fully coordinate metal atoms decreases and, consequently, both the concentration of such defects as well as the degree of the electron localization caused by the defects are suppressed.\n\nThe presence of valence band tail states becomes irrelevant for the optical transmission of under-stoichiometric AOSsowing to the pronounced Burstein–Moss shift upon the degenerate doping. From the accurate DFT-based hybrid-functional calculations of the real and imaginary dielectric function for amorphous In–X–O with 20% fractional substitution of X = Ga, Zn, or Sn, it is found that all three compositions demonstrate low optical absorption within the visible range; that is, for 1.8–3.0 eV (Figure 6e). Compared to amorphous indium oxide obtained with the same MD quench rate and the same oxygen stoichiometry as the In–X–O structures, addition of 20% of zinc reduces the optical band gap by 0.2 eV, whereas the same fraction of tin or gallium has no effect on the optical absorption edge and the gap remains equal to 3.2 eV (Figure 6e). \n\nAs expected, larger substitutional fraction of Ga opens up the transparency window: the optical band gap for amorphous In1.19Ga0.81O2.94 is 3.5 eV. Thus, cation composition is an indispensable tool to manipulate the crystallization, carrier transport, as well as optical band gap of multicomponent AOSs.\n\n## 6. Structure And Properties Of Aoss Under Strain\n\nAnother important technological advantage of AOSs is their mechanical flexibility: the amorphous oxides are bendable and maintain their excellent optical and electrical properties under the strain.[97] The superior mechanical properties of AOSs over their crystalline counterparts that are brittle make the amorphous oxide semiconductors an attractive candidate for flexible transparent electronics.\n\nTo understand how the structural, electronic, and optical properties of AOSs change under strain, amorphous In2O3 and Zn0.30In1.40Sn0.30O3.04 (a-ZITO) structures were simulated using MD liquid-quench approach with 200 K ps−1 rate. Once the amorphous structures were equilibrated at 300 K and optimized within DFT, the volume of the cells was changed to induce lattice strain and the atomic positions of all atoms in the cell were fully relaxed within DFT for each configuration. The structural analysis of the strained a-IO and a-ZITO reveals that the average M–O distances increase slower than expected from the volume expansion (Figure 7), suggesting that a structural reorganization has likely occurred.\n\nThe coordination of all metal species decreases with strain, albeit differently for each of the metal types (Figure 7d). Among In, 'Zn and Sn, indium atoms steadily loose oxygen atoms at a highest rate— in accord with its low coordination in amorphous In–Sn–O and In–Zn–O (see Section 4). The average coordination of tin is notably higher than that of indium but only up to the lattice increase of 1.9%; at that point, the Sn–O coordination drops from 5.3 to nearly 5.0 and the amorphous structure breaks— as signified by a discontinuity in the total energy\n(for comparison, the structure of undoped amorphous indium oxide withstands up to 3% lattice increase; Figure 7a). On the contrary, zinc, having the strongest metal–oxygen bonds in a-ZITO, maintains its coordination of four and even \"picks up\" the oxygen atoms lost by Sn at the break point.\n\nThe first-shell characteristics of the metal constituents—the metal-oxygen bond strength and the preference for specific MO coordination—determine the sharing between the MO polyhedra and, consequently, the response of the medium-range structure to the lattice expansion. As discussed in Section 2 above, the crystalline-to-amorphous transition in amorphous indium oxide suppresses the number of edge-shared InO polyhedra from 50% to 20% giving rise to predominantly cornershared polyhedra network in the amorphous state. Upon volume expansion, the corner-sharing fraction increases to 90% (Figure 7e). Because corner-shared MO polyhedra with only a single connecting oxygen atom have more degrees of freedom as compared to an edge-shared connection, the corner-shared polyhedral network is capable to respond to the induced volume expansion more efficiently, helping make the amorphous oxide materials fracture- resistant. The ability of the corner- shared M–M connections to absorb the internal lattice stress is likely to be the main reason for the slow increase of the MO distances upon the lattice strain (Figure 7b).\n\nSchematically, the local and medium-range structural changes upon the lattice strain in AOSs can be represented as follows (Figure 7f): i) Initially, two six- coordinated MO polyhedra are connected via two oxygen atoms; that is, are edgeshared. ii) The volume expansion causes one of the polyhedra loose an oxygen atom to become five- coordinate, making the oxygen environment around this under- coordinate metal atom uneven (the cation \"sticks out\" on one side of the polyhedra).\n\nii) Further volume expansion transforms the M–M connection from edge-shared to corner-shared; this transformation reduces the coordination of the other metal atom from six to five which allows both metal cation to achieve a uniform, charge-balanced oxygen coordination. Thus, strain- induced changes in sharing\n\n![12_image_0.png](12_image_0.png)\n\n![13_image_1.png](13_image_1.png)\n\nof the MO polyhedra play a crucial role in the mechanical properties of AOSs.\n\nAs expected from the longer M–O distances upon the volume expansion, the calculated band gap in strained a-ZITO steadily decreases up to the breaking point (Figure 7c). Above the 1.9% lattice increase, the band gap value remains to be 2.6 eV—consistent with the fact that the average In–O and Sn–O distances slightly shorten at the break point and do not increase further above the break point. The latter finding may be explained by a formation of a void in the amorphous structure upon break, whereas the first-shell M–O distances are maintained, on average. Based on a simple description of the electronic states of a semiconductor using k · p theory,[98] a smaller band gap value should lead to a smaller electron effective mass and a larger electron velocity due to an increased dispersion of the conduction band. In a-ZITO, however, the electron velocity calculated for the amorphous supercell at 0.5 eV above the conduction band minimum, is found to decrease with volume expansion (Figure 7c). The reduction of the electron velocity can be explained based on a comparison of the calculated inverse participation ratio values in the strained a-ZITO: upon the volume expansion, both the IPR value of some states in the conduction band as well as the number of such localized states increase. The formation of such electron-trapping defects is associated with the energy disparity between the differently-coordinated MO polyhedra \n(for example, fully-coordinate ZnO4 vs. under-coordinate InO and SnO) that increases with volume expansion. Despite the strain-induced electron localization, both the calculated band gap (2.6–2.9 eV) and the supercell electron velocity \n(6–7 × 105 m s−1) in the amorphous Zn–In–Sn–O remain to be comparable to the values of typical TCOs,[90] suggesting that AOSs retain their excellent optical and electrical properties under strain.\n\n## 7. Conclusions\n\n![13_Image_0.Png](13_Image_0.Png)\n\nThe results of systematic ab initio MD simulations, highly precise DFT-based electronic structure calculations, and detailed experimental observations for several In-based oxides are combined into a comprehensive framework to describe the complex microscopic behavior in the prototype AOSs. Four major components that comprise the parameter space of the AOSs (**Figure** 8), namely i) deposition temperature; ii) oxygen stoichiometry; iii) cation composition, and iv) lattice strain, were studied independently. Contingently, the primary role(s) played by each of the four parameters are categorized as follows:\nDeposition temperature (or theoretical quench rate) governs the structural and, consequently, the transport regimes during the amorphous to crystalline transition in the oxides. As the structure transforms from nanostructured amorphous to coexistence of crystalline and amorphous phases, and further to crystalline grains, the primary carrier transport mechanism changes from localization, to hopping, to multi-phase percolation and scattering, and further to bulk conductivity, respectively. The developed theoretical model of prototype In-based AOSs provides a fundamental basis for a versatile description of the structural archetypes in these non-periodic oxide systemsfrom distorted polyhedral network to nano- and microstructure.\n\nCation composition allows one to control the crystallization temperature and, hence, to fine-tune the degree of amorphization as well as the degree of electron localization governed by composition-dependent characteristics of variable range hopping. Both the substitutional doping level and the type of added metal species have a strong effect on the robustness of the MO chains and the AOSs nanostructure, and therefore, determine the limits of the carrier mobility in the amorphous regime and the range of deposition temperatures for high mobility.\n\nAnother great technological advantage of the multi-cation AOSs is tunable optical band gap and work function.\n\nOxygen stoichiometry proves to be the sole mechanism to generate free electrons in AOSs. Given the many degrees of freedom in the amorphous structure, the long-range structural characteristics and the electronic properties of the donor defects in AOSs differ fundamentally from those in their crystalline oxide counterparts. The oxygen/metal ratio controls the formation of structural defects near both band edges of the semiconductor: the concentration as well as the degree of localization of the conduction defects are interrelated to those of the valence tail states. Importantly, the results show that defects in AOSs require full MD simulation and cannot be modeled with simple post-quench oxygen vacancies.\n\nLattice strain associated with external or internal stress (e.g., \ndue to flexible organic substrate, thin film geometry, or mismatched cation size) affects the local distortions in the MO \npolyhedra as well as in the polyhedral network and may further enhance the effects of deposition temperature, oxygen stoichiometry, or cation composition on the defect formation[99] as well as on the transport and optical properties of AOSs.\n\nThe thorough microscopic understanding gained within the framework of this four-dimensional parameter space of the In-based AOSs, serves as a solid foundation for i) finding an optimal set of parameters to tailor the electrical, optical, thermal, and mechanical properties of AOSs for specific applications, enhancing the utility of these materials for practical devices; and ii) exploring possible ways to extend the phase space of known AOSs by including novel anion and cation compositions toward next-generation amorphous semiconductors.\n\n## 8. Experimental Section\n\nTheoretical calculations: The amorphous oxide structures were generated using first-principles molecular-dynamics (MD) liquidquench simulations as implemented in the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP).[100–103] The calculations are based on the density functional theory (DFT) with periodic boundary conditions and employ PBE functional[104] within the projector augmented-wave method.[105,106]\nA bixbyite cell of In2O3 with crystalline density of 7.12 g cm−3 and with 80 (or 134) atoms per cell was used as initial structure which was melted at 3000 K to eliminate any crystalline memory. To model nonstoichiometric indium oxide, oxygen atoms were randomly removed from the melt and the new structures were kept at 3000 K for additional 5–10 ps to randomize the configuration. Similarly, for doped indium oxide, random In atoms were substituted with a specific fraction of Ga, Sn, or Zn, and the cell density as well as the oxygen/metal ratio were adjusted prior to additional melting. Specifically, the density of In–X–O \nwith 20 at% X was 6.90 g cm−3, 6.99 g cm−3, and 6.75 g cm−3 for X =\nGa, Sn, and Zn, respectively. For each of the In-based oxide melt, liquid quench simulations were performed as follows. The structure was cooled to 1700 K at the MD rate of 100 K ps−1 and then rapidly quenched to 100 K with a desired rate (5–900 K ps−1). An energy cut-off of 260 eV \nand single Γ-point were used during melting and quenching processes. Finally, each structure was equilibrated at 300 K for 6–10 ps with a cut-off energy of 400 eV. All MD simulations were carried out in the NVT ensemble with the Nose–Hoover thermostat using an integration time step of 2 fs. For an accurate structural analysis of the theoretically modeled AOSs, the average pair correlation function and the average effective coordination number were calculated.[107,108] Note that in this work the coordination distribution is obtained as a time average; that is, as an average of the coordination distribution over at least 5000 MD \n\n![14_image_1.png](14_image_1.png)\n\nsteps at 300 K. The time averaging represents a more reliable approach \n\n![14_image_0.png](14_image_0.png) as compared to the structural analysis of a single amorphous structure by capturing the structural variations at given temperature.\n\nNext, the atomic configurations obtained from the ab initio MD \nsimulations were optimized using the PBE functional.[104] For the optimization, a cut-off energy of 500 eV and the 4 × 4 × 4 Γ-centered k-point mesh were used; the atomic positions were relaxed until the Hellmann–Feynman force on each atom was below 0.01 eV Å−1. \n\nThe electronic and optical properties of amorphous In-based oxides were calculated using the hybrid Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE06) \napproach[109,110] with a mixing parameter of 0.25 and a screening parameter μ of 0.2 Å−1. To characterize the localization of the electronic states within the band gap and near the band edges, the inverse participation ratio (IPR) was calculated. Optical absorption was derived from the frequency-dependent dielectric function, ε(ω) = ε1(ω) + iε2(ω), \ncalculated within independent particle approximation as implemented in VASP. The imaginary part, ε2(ω), is related to the optical absorption at a given frequency ω, and is determined based on the electronic transitions of the hybrid functional solution. The real part of the complex dielectric function is obtained using Kramers-Kronig relations.\n\nThe structural properties and charge density distribution in amorphous oxides were analyzed and plotted using VESTA.[111]\nExperimental procedure: Amorphous oxide thin films were grown by pulsed-laser deposition (PLD) from a dense hot-pressed indium oxide, zinc oxide, tin oxide, and gallium oxide targets (25 mm diameter). PLD was accomplished with a 248 nm KrF excimer laser with 25 ns pulse duration and operated at 2 Hz. The 200 mJ per pulse beam was focused onto a 1 mm × 3 mm spot size. Less than 1 monolayer is deposited during each In2O3/XO PLD cycle to ensure mixing at the atomiclayer level. The target was rotated at 5 rpm about its axis to prevent localized heating. The target–substrate separation was fixed at 10 cm. For multicomponent films the appropriate basis-oxide targets were employed. A computer controlled shuttle was used to alternate ablation between targets. Less than one monolayer of material was deposited in a typical cycle between the targets to help ensure uniformity of film composition; the ratio of the pulses for each metal oxide in each cycle was adjusted to obtain the desired film composition. The compositions reported are nominal compositions: the ratio of the number of dopant pulses to total pulses. The films were grown on silicon substrates in an O2 ambient varied from 1 mTorr to 16 mTorr. The substrates were attached to the substrate holder with silver paint and grown at a deposition temperature specified in the text or figure caption. Films grown above 25 °C were attached to a resistively heated substrate holder; films grown below 25 °C were attached to a liquid nitrogen cooled substrate holder. Sheet resistance (Rs: Ω □−1), carrier type, area carrierconcentration (na: 1 cm−2), and carrier mobility (μhall: cm2 V−1 s−1) were measured with a Ecopia 3000 Hall measurement system on samples in the van der Pauw geometry. Carrier density (nv: 1 cm−3) and resistivity \n(ρ: Ω cm) were calculated by dividing the area carrier concentration and sheet resistance, respectively, by the film thickness. Film thickness (d: nm) was measured using a spectral reflectometer (Filmetrics F20).\n\n## Supporting Information\n\nSupporting information is available from the Wiley Online Library or from the author.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThe authors are grateful to Thomas O.

Already, n-channel a-IGZO-TFT is widely employed as a TFT pixel switching backplane for several high-performance active-matrix flat-panel displays, and oxide-TFT\ntechnology to date is well acknowledged as the best TFT technology for future device applications in the wide range area of electronics such as sensors, Internet of things (IoT), energy-harvesting, medical/bio-interface device, etc. Therefore, the development of large-scale circuit beyond discrete TFT device level becomes increasingly important and is vital to advance the next stage of oxideTFT technology. In particular, developing oxide-TFT-based inverter device technology is the key for developing several digital and analog circuits. In this paper, the recent progress and challenges in oxide-TFT-based inverter technology, including unipolar NMOS, PMOS, CMOS, and CMOS-like inverters using ambipolar oxide-TFT, are reviewed.\n\nARTICLE HISTORY\n\n![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)\n\nReceived 22 June 2021 Accepted 24 August 2021 KEYWORDS\n\noxide; thin-film transistors (TFTs); inverter; CMOS;\np-channel TFT; ring oscillator\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nThin-film transistor (TFT) is the key technology for developing next-generation flexible/wearable electronics implemented on any low-cost substrates [1,2]. Among several TFT technologies including organic, amorphous Si, and low-temperature poly-Si (LTPS)-TFTs, oxide semiconductor-TFT (oxide-TFT) technology represented by amorphous-In–Ga–Zn–O (a-IGZO)-TFT is widely recognized as the most promising because the n-channel oxide-TFT meets the requirements for both the high device performance and high manufacturability for future electronics [3,4,5,6]. Since a-IGZO-TFT\nexhibiting excellent device characteristics such as high TFT mobility of >10 cm2/Vs, low-off current as low as <1 pA, low-voltage operation of ±3 V, steep subthreshold slope of ∼0.1 V/decade, etc. can be fabricated by conventional dc/rf/ac sputtering on a large-size glass substrate (for example, 2840 mm × 3370 mm (Gen 10+)) at the low-temperature process (<300oC), the aIGZO-TFT have been already commercialized as a TFT\npixel switching backplane for several high-performance active-matrix flat-panel displays (AM-FPDs) such as lowpower consumption liquid crystal display (AMLCD)\nmobile display and high-resolution (3840 × 2160 (4K\nUHD))-PC monitor and high-resolution and large-size\n(4K-83 class) organic light-emitting diode (AMOLED)\nTV panels and so on [7,8]. Moreover, the high oncurrent capability originating from high TFT mobility in n-channel oxide-TFT enable a peripheral integration of gate driver circuits, which is composed of several types of logic inverter gates, with a pixel circuit for AM-FPDs\n[9]. The gate driver monolithic circuit (GDM) technology offers the compactness and mechanical reliability, and overall cost reduction by eliminating the external driver ICs and is critical for mobile display applications with narrow bezels.\n\nFor next-generation ubiquitous network society, moreover, flexible/wearable electronic devices become more increasing important and are highly required with the low-power operation, low-cost manufacturing process, and higher-level integrations of various functions including high-resolution display, high-density information storage, high-speed information processing/transfer, several sensors such as position-sensitive pressure sensors, temperature sensor, health sensing devices, etc., which is known as system-on-glass (SOG) and systemon-panel (SOP) technology [10–13].\n\nCONTACT Kenji Nomura kenomura@eng.ucsd.edu Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92092, USA ISSN (print): 1598-0316; ISSN (online): 2158-1606 Therefore, developing TFT-based inverter technology, which is a fundamental building block for digital logic gate circuits and several analog circuits in the current modern electronics, is critical for GDM and SOG technology [14]. However, traditional silicon semiconductors device technology cannot meet the requirements to develop such fundamental devices onto a wide variety of large size and soft substrates such as plastic, paper, and fabric. Developing oxide-TFT-based inverter and the related logic gate are indispensable for highperformance, cost-effective future ubiquitous devices\n[15–17].\n\nHence, this paper reviews the recent progress and challenges in oxide-TFT-based inverter technology developments. The oxide-TFT-based inverters such as (1)\nunipolar n-type metal–oxide-semiconductor (NMOS),\n(2) p-type MOS (PMOS), (3) complementary metal– oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) inverters including (1)\np-organic/n-oxide-TFT hybrid CMOS and (2) all-oxideTFT-based CMOS are discussed with the recent progress of p-channel oxide-TFT development. (4) CMOS-like inverter using two identical ambipolar-TFT using (1) bi-layered channel structure composed of organic/oxide semiconductors and (2) Tin monoxide (SnO) channel are also discussed. Finally, we briefly reviewed ring oscillator (RO) circuit development using oxide-TFT inverters for large-scale circuit applications.\n\n## 2. Oxide-Tft-Based Nmos Inverter\n\nSo far, numerous efforts have been demonstrated for developing oxide-TFT-based inverters and the related circuit applications such as flip-flop, RO, shift register, logic gates (NAND and NOR gate), radio-frequency identification (RFID) tag, etc. Due to the absence of highperformance p-channel oxide-TFTs originating from the intrinsic electronic structure nature, in which the valence band maximum (VBM) is composed of a localized Oxygen 2p orbital [3,18], the most reported oxide-TFT\ninverter is currently NMOS inverter implemented only by n-channel oxide-TFTs.\n\nFigure 1(a,b) shows the schematic of equivalent circuit diagrams for NMOS inverters with saturated enhancement (E)-mode and depletion (D)-mode TFTs as an active load (*i.e.* pull-up device) [19]. The enhancementtype inverter consists of two E-mode TFTs with positive threshold voltage (Vth) for both load and drive-TFT\ndevices. The gate terminal connects to the drain terminal, also known as diode-connect or diode-load, for the load-TFT, which works as non-linear resistor, and always operates in the saturation regime (Figure 1(a)). When the input voltage (VIN) is zero or low level, the drive-TFT\nis in the cut-off. Consequently, no steady-state current flows in the circuit, and the load-TFT pulls the output up toward the power supply (Vdd). The enhancementload-type NMOS inverter can be fabricated by a simple fabrication process but cannot be operated with rail-torail signal swing due to the limitation of high output voltage (VOH), which is determined by Vdd– Vth. On the other hand, depletion-load-type inverter is constructed using D-mode TFT with negative Vth as a load device, in which the gate and source terminals are tied, also called as 'zero-VGS' (Figure 1 (b)). In this case, the Dmode load-TFT is always 'ON' because of the gate bias\n(Vgs(load)) = 0 V regardless of the VIN. The depletionload inverter exhibits better inverter characteristics such as sharp inverter transition, large noise margin, lowpower consumption, and smaller overall layout area than the enhancement-load-type device.\n\nFigure 1(c) also illustrates the typical voltage transfer characteristics (VTC) of an inverter. At VIN = 0 V,\nthe output voltage (VOUT) is close to Vdd. As VIN\nincreases and the drive-TFT turns on, VOUT reaches to zero beyond the inverter threshold voltage (VT), which is defined by Vdd/2, due to steady-state current flow.\n\nThe VTC provides the important fundamental device parameters such as VT, voltage gain, noise margin (NM),\npower dissipation (P), and so on. The voltage gain, which is defined as dVOUT /dVIN, is often used as a benchmark to indicate the device quality of TFT-based inverters, especially oxide-TFT-based inverter. Noise margins at high and low levels (NMH and NML) and transition width (-VIN) are also defined by NMH = VOH - VIH, NML = VIL - VOL and -VIN = VIH - VIL, where VIH,\nVIL, VOH, and VOL are input and output voltages at high and low levels, respectively. In addition to the TFT device performances, the VTC is largely affected by TFT\ndevice parameters such as the Vth of drive/load-TFTs and the drive-to-load ratio (kR), defining kR = (W/L)\ndrive/(W/L) load-TFTs. Here, the W and L are the channel width and length of the drive and the loadTFTs. In general, TFT should be designed with small kR to achieve good VTC such as high voltage gain and large NM.\n\nFigure 2 shows the n-channel oxide materials and the progress of output voltage gain of the reported oxideTFT-based NMOS-inverters. Table 1 also summarizes the details of device structure parameters and device performances of the reported oxide-TFT-NMOS inverters including enhancement and depletion-load types. Since several good n-type oxide semiconductor materials are currently available for n-channel oxide-TFT, the reports regarding NMOS inverter over 30 papers are easily found. The major n-channel oxide material is a-IGZO (several composition ratios of In:Ga:Zn are available for a-IGZO) and ZnO. Since the first report of oxide-NMOS inverter\n\n![3_image_0.png](3_image_0.png)\n\n![3_image_1.png](3_image_1.png)\n\nwith a voltage gain of 1.5 using the staggered bottomgated In–Ga–O (IGO)-TFT by Presley*et al.* in 2006 [20],\nthe gain is significantly improving last decade, and the maximum gain currently reaches >380 for ZnO-TFT\ninverter with depletion-load-type inverter [21]. Since the depletion-load-type inverter is highly preferable in terms of device performances, most of the reported device is depletion-load-type inverter.\n\nRemarkable progress on the device performances of oxide-NMOS inverter can be seen in ZnO-TFT-basedNMOS inverters with the voltage gain of 248 [37] and a-IGZO-TFT-NMOS inverter with 220 [39], respectively. Lee *et al.* developed a Schottky-barrier a-IGZOTFT operating in the deep subthreshold regime by using the high-resistive a-IGZO channel and Mo electrode. The depletion-load-type NMOS inverter exhibited good VTC performances such as high voltage gain >220 (Vdd = 2V) and low output-power consumption of <150 pW, which demonstrated a high potential of oxide-NMOS inverter for a low-power device that can be driven by a nanowatt power source. In 2017, Alshammari *et al*. [21] achieved a high voltage gain of 382 (Vdd = 25 V) in a depletion-loadtype NMOS inverter using ALD-fabricated ZnO-TFTs.\n\nThey concluded the high-performance inverter were originated from the excellent ZnO-TFT characteristics such as high TFT mobility of ∼15 cm2/Vs and small s-value of ∼130 mV/dec by using high-k HfO2 gate oxide and SnO2 gate electrodes. Moreover, the low propagation delay of 150 ns/stage and high operation frequency of 303 kHz was also demonstrated in the RO circuit using the ZnO-TFT-based depletion-type NMOS inverter.\n\nFor the depletion-load NMOS inverter, fabricating two stable E-mode and D-mode oxide-TFTs on a single chip, is required. In general, two E-mode devices are firstly fabricated on a substrate, and then one device converts to D-mode TFT by extra post-process steps. Since the donor density in the n-channel is a dominant\n\n| W and L are the channel width and length of load/drive-TFTs, respectively.

for fabricating Dmode TFT. It is well known that oxygen deficiency and impurity hydrogen work as an electron donor in many n-type oxides [52,53]. Thus, the primal technique is the controlling of such defects and impurity levels. The oxygen deficiency can be easily controlled by the channel fabrication process conditions such as oxygen partial pressure during deposition/postannealing process, but these conventional techniques are difficult to selectively fabricate D-mode TFT next to E-mode device. To electively fabricate D-mode TFTs, several approaches have been proposed, including the control of channel compositions [31,35], the channel layer thickness control [25], local laser annealing [34],\nthe use of different gate electrode materials, the formation of capping layer [33,40], low-k/high-k double gate oxide, top-gated structure, dual-gated structure [32] etc. Moreover, the fabrication of D-mode TFT by utilizing device degradation processes such as bias stress [30], light-irradiation [47], etc. was also proposed.\n\nSeveral circuit-level demonstrations by using solution printing/inkjet-processed oxide-TFTs have been also reported. Recently, Shao *et al.* [51] developed 64 × 64 TFT array on glass substrate using In2O3/IGZO-bilayer TFTs (Mobility ∼ 18.80 / 28.44 cm2/Vs) fabricated by a self-confined inkjet printing technology and demonstrated good inverter characteristics with a voltage gain of 112.\n\n## 3. Oxide–Tft-Based Pmos Inverter\n\nPMOS inverter is composed of p-channel-TFTs for drive and load-TFT devices. Since n-channel device usually shows higher carrier mobility, NMOS inverter exhibits several advantages such as higher density, and higher speed operations. Therefore, NMOS inverter is generally preferable in most circuit applications, but the advantages of PMOS inverter for some specific applications can be found. As an example, LTPS-TFT-based PMOS inverter have been proposed for reducing the manufacturing cost and improving the yield of LTPS-TFT for largesized AM-FPDs [54]. Instead of the CMOS driver circuit, the fabrication process can be also simplified, and the cost can be reduced by using unipolar p-channel TFT technology. Since n-type LTPS-TFTs show poor stability due to hot carrier stress degradation; moreover, PMOS inverter are expected greatly to develop more stable circuits than LTPS-CMOS circuits. It is also well known that several good p-channel-TFTs are available in inkjet/printable-organic semiconductors [55,56]. Owing to the high potential of the cost-effective manufacturing process for flexible display and microelectronics, many organic-TFT-based PMOS inverter have been demonstrated. In contrast, only one demonstration for both enhancement/depletion-load-type PMOS inverter using SnO-TFTs (Mobility of ∼1.6 cm2/Vs, Vth = −0.3 V\nand the on/off current ratio of 103–104) can be found in oxide-TFT technology [57]. Oxide-TFT-based PMOS inverter is largely behind form NMOS inverter due to a low number of device quality p-type oxides.\n\nAlthough unipolar NMOS and PMOS inverters can be fabricated by relatively simple fabrication process with a less number of process steps, Complementary metal–oxide -semiconductor (CMOS) inverter technology, configured by both n-channel and p-channelTFTs, are highly demanded because CMOS device exhibits significant advantages for most digital and analog circuit applications owing to the better device performances such as low noise immunity, low-power consumption, low heat dissipation, small device footprint area, etc. These features allow the development of more simple circuit architectures with high packing density on integration circuit applications. Therefore, TFT-based CMOS is a critical technology for SOP,\nwhich requires to highly integration of various functional devices with display.\n\nFigure 3(a) shows the equivalent circuit diagram of the CMOS inverter with p-channel and n-channel-TFTs as pull-up and pull-down devices, respectively. In CMOS, both the input gate and output (*i.e.* drain) terminals are tied together, and the source terminal in n-channel and p-channel-TFT connect to a ground and supply voltage (i.e.Vdd), respectively. p-channel and n-channel TFTs operate complimentary in drive and load-devices by the input signals. When the VIN is low, n-channelTFT is 'off', while p-channel TFT stays 'on'. Thus, pchannel-TFT pulls the output up toward the Vdd, and the VOUT appears at high. When the VIN moves toward high, n-channel-TFT turns on at the VIN >Vth(n), the VOUT transits to low state. Figure 3(b) also illustrates the cross-sectional view of a typical CMOS inverter consisting of inverted staggered-type, *i.e.* bottom-gate and top-contact structure, n-channel and p-channel-TFTs on a substrate. The bottom-gate structure is the most common for oxide-TFTs because the top-gate fabrication process often causes the generation of extra defects in the channel layer and serious degradations of TFT device performances.\n\n## 4.1. Oxide/Organic-Tft-Based Hybrid Cmos Inverter\n\nAs already explained, currently good oxide-TFT are almost n-channel, while good organic-TFT vice versa.\n\nThus, these materials do not have adequate complementary counterparts to each other. To address this, a hybridCMOS inverter comprised of n-channel oxide-TFT and p-channel organic-TFT has been proposed. Figure 4 shows these channel materials and the progress of output voltage gain of hybrid-CMOS-inverters using n-oxide/porganic-TFT. Table 2 also lists the details of device performances of the reported hybrid-CMOS inverters.\n\nSeveral TFT material combinations for oxide/organicTFT-hybrid-CMOS have been reported so far. In the early stage, the major combination was n-ZnO and n-a-IGZO\nwith p-pentacene, which is known as an organic semiconductor with a relatively high hole mobility of ∼1 cm2/Vs, and the high voltage gain of ∼100 was achieved by using these oxide and organic-TFTs and proper device dimensional design. The current popular hybrid structure is composed of n-a-IGZO and p-carbon nanotube\n(CNT)-TFTs with high hole mobility.\n\nIn 2008, Oh *et al.* [60] demonstrated a flexible hybridCMOS exhibiting a high voltage gain of 94 (Vdd = 7 V) with n-ZnO-TFT (Mobility ∼0.9 cm2/Vs, Vth ∼\n0.1 V, s-values of ∼0.44 V/decade, and the on/off current ratio of ∼6.5×105) and p-pentacene-TFT (∼0.4 cm2/Vs, −1.8 V, ∼0.91 V/decade, and ∼2.5×104) fabricated at the low temperature as low as 100°C on flexible polyethersulfone substrate. Na *et al.* also fabricated hybrid-CMOS with the gain of ∼56 (Vdd = 7 V) by using n-a-IGZO-TFT (Mobility ∼17.1 cm2/Vs, Vth ∼2.4 V, s-values ∼0.1 V/decade, and the on/off ratio ∼107) with p-channel pentacene-TFTs, and also developed complementary 5-stage ring oscillator with the operating frequency of 200 Hz (Vdd = 10 V) and the propagation delays of 0.3–0.7 ms/stage [61]. Poly (9,9-dioctylfluorene-alt-bithiophene) (F8T2), which is also a well-known inkjet printable-organic semiconductor having a hole mobility of ∼0.1 cm2/Vs and good stability against environmental oxygen and residual impurities, is also widely used for the counterpart of n-channel oxide-TFTs in the oxide/organic-TFT-based hybrid-CMOS inverter [62].\n\n![6_image_0.png](6_image_0.png)\n\n![6_image_1.png](6_image_1.png)\n\nBy taking the advantages of low-temperature processability and printing/inkjet process compatibility for both oxide and organic-TFT technologies, three-dimensional (3D) CMOS structure, which enable to develop the highly integrated device, have been also proposed.\n\nFigure 5 shows 3D-vertically stacked flexible hybridCMOS inverters that made up of n-a-IGZO and pF8T2-TFTs, where all the fabrication processes were performed at temperatures <120°C on plastics. Since the n-a-IGZO-TFT (Mobility of ∼ 3.2 cm2/Vs) and pF8T2-TFTs (∼1.7×10−3 cm2/Vs) are constructed by inverted-staggered and top-gate structure, respectively, the gate terminals are shared in these TFTs. (Figure 5(b)). The maximum voltage gain is ∼67, and the NMH and NML were ∼10.4 and ∼18.3V (Vdd = 30V),\nshowing that the inverter guarantees a large allowance for logic operation (>20% of Vdd). Moreover, the flexible NAND logic circuit was also demonstrated by using the 3D-stacked hybrid-CMOS inverter [69].\n\nOwing to excellent material properties such as high carrier mobility, high current density capability, excellent mechanical flexibility/stretchability, and good process compatibility with low-cost solution processes of CNT, p-cannel CNT-TFT is the highly promising counterpart for the n-channel oxide-TFT for oxide/organic hybrid-CMOS inverter. Already, several n-oxide-TFT/pCNT-TFT-based hybrid-CMOS exhibiting high voltage gain over 100 have been demonstrated. Very recently, Lee et al. developed high-performance hybrid-CMOS with a high gain of 123 (Vdd = 10 V) and low-power consumption of 9.8 μW by using solution-processed p-channel CNT-TFTs (Mobility ∼45.2 cm2/Vs, Vth ∼ −1.1 V, and the on/off current ratio ∼105) and sputter-fabricated n-channel a-IGZO-TFT. (∼20.7 cm2/V s, ∼1.2 V, and\n\n| Power consumption                                             | Ref.                  |                                              |                                   |                                  |             |                                       |          |           |       |    |\n|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------|----------|-----------|-------|----|\n| Year                                        | n-channel material    | p-channel material                           | W/L (um) for p and n channel-TFTs | Gain                             | Vdd (V)     | NMH / NML(V)                          |          |           |       |    |\n| 2007                                        | ZnO                   | Pentacene                                    | 500/90, 500/90                    | 26                               | 2           | -

The achievement is considered mainly by originating from the use of high-performance of pchannel TFT and the well-balanced electrical performances of CNT-TFTs and a-IGZO-TFTs.\n\n## 4.2. All-Oxide-Tft-Based Cmos Inverter\n\nIntensive research for all-oxide-TFT-based CMOS inverter, which is composed of both n-channel and p-channel oxide-TFTs, is currently ongoing. However, due to the absence of oxide semiconductors that can control p/n polarity at device-quality level, a single oxide material-based CMOS has not been developed yet. Therefore, all the current oxide-CMOS is constructed by different channel materials for n and p-channel oxideTFTs. Figure 6(a) shows the channel materials of p and n-channel oxide-TFTs for all-oxide-TFT CMOS\ninverters. Several material choices are available for nchannel oxide-TFTs, including ZnO, a-IGZO, SnO2, In2O3, etc. In contrast, only material, SnO, Cu2O and NiO channels, which intrinsically exhibit p-type nature, are available for p-channel oxide-TFT, although several p-type oxides have been discovered so far [91–93]. The current main combination is n-a-IGZO and p-SnO-TFTs, which mainly comes from relatively better TFT device performance of SnO-TFT than other p-channel oxideTFT, in addition to the low-temperature device processability as low as 300°C [94].\n\nFigure 6(b) also shows the progress of voltage gain in the reported all-oxide-TFT-based CMOS inverters.\n\nTable 3 summarizes the details of device structure parameters and device performances for the reported alloxide-CMOS inverters. Since the first demonstration of oxide-TFT-based CMOS inverter using n-In2O3 (Mobility of ∼0.054 cm2/Vs and Vth ∼10 V) and p-SnOx\n(0.0047 cm2/Vs and ∼30 V) with the voltage gain of 11\n[95], several efforts to improving inverter performances accompanied by p-channel oxide-TFT development have been intensively devoted. For p-channel Cu2O-TFTs, vertical geometric flexible CMOS inverter composed of vertically stacked n-a-IGZO (Mobility of 1.58 cm2/Vs and Vth ∼5.77 V) / p-Cu2O-TFTs (0.0022 cm2/Vs and\n\n![8_image_0.png](8_image_0.png)\n\n![8_image_1.png](8_image_1.png)\n\n~ —4.75 V) was demonstrated with a relatively high gain value of 120 (V dd = 20 V) and the NM H / NM L values of 11.68 and 6.01 V, respectively [ 96 ].\n\nHigh-performance all-oxide-TFT-CMOS inverters exhibiting high voltage gain have been also developed with the combination of n -a-IGZO and p -SnO-TFTs. In 2018, Yuan et al. demonstrated a high voltage gain of 26 (V dd = 3.0 V) with a maximum power consumption of 241.2 nW by using high- k Al 2 O 3 gate insulator with 7.5 nm thickness [ 107 ]. The CMOS was built up by a- IGZO-TFT and SnO-TFT with the device mobility of 12.08, 0.60 cm 2 /Vs, s-values of 0.24, 0.75 V/dec., the V th of 1.87 V, − 1.61 V and on/off current ratio of 2.15 × 10 6 and 1.50 × 10 4 , respectively. By using the CMOS-inverter, 5-stages RO circuit also successfully operated with the operation frequency of 1.04 kHz ( V dd  =  1.5 V), the stage delay of 12–66 µ s/stage (Vdd = 1.5–4.5V), and the whole circuit power current of 24.63–0.74 µ A. Very recently, flexible all-oxide-CMOS inverter exhibiting a high gain of 370 ( V dd = 10 V) have been made by monolithically integrating a top-gated n -a-IGZO-TFT and a bottomgated ρ -SnO-TFT with ALD-HfO 2 capping layer [ 116 ].\n\nThe recent progress of all-oxide-CMOS inverter is remarkable, but the device performances are still not\n\n| Table 3.

This is mainly due to the unbalanced device performances of n and p-channel oxide-TFTs and is attributed to the poor TFT performance of p-channel oxide-TFTs. The main reason for the poor device performances for p-channel-TFTs is due to the presence of high-density subgap defects including bulk channel and front-interface/back-channel surfaces. Therefore, several attempts to eliminate subgap defects for p-channel oxide materials have been made.\n\nFor p-SnO channels, oxygen vacancy (Vo) that forms hole trap above the VBM is the root causes for degrading the TFT performances [113,117,118]. Post-thermal annealing is widely used not only to crystallize p-type oxide channels but also to reduce carrier trap states. However, the annealing condition for p-channel oxides is quite limited due to the existence of undesired oxide with higher valence state of metal cations, e.g. Sn(IV)O2 in Tin oxide [119,120]. So far, several approaches including hydrogen annealing, passivation formation, hightemperature deposition have been proposed to reduce subgap defects for SnO. Although the TFT device has not been demonstrated yet, epitaxial SnO films with remarkable high Hall mobility of ∼10 cm2/Vs with a low hole density of ∼1016 cm−3 have been successfully grown by high-temperature PLD deposition [121]. The achievement brings high expectations to furthermore improve TFT characteristics in the p-channel SnO-TFTs.\n\nOn the other hand, Vo is also energetically stable point defect but electrically inactive defect for Cu2O channel\n[122,123]. Therefore, amphoteric Cu interstitial defect\n(Cui) is considered to have a large responsibility for the poor device performance of Cu2O-TFT [115,124].\n\nAlthough the Cu2O has high hole mobility, moreover, the TFT mobility is quite low. Recent studies clarified that the back-channel defect degraded the TFT performances and found eliminating back-channel Cui was the key to improve the device performances.\n\nFigure 7(a) shows the improvement of TFT performances of Cu2O-TFT by back-channel defect termination by using sulfur ion generated from Thiourea solution. By reducing the back-channel Cui defect originating from the formation of CuSO4 back-channel layer\n(Figure 7(b)), significant improvements of the off-current down to as low as ∼1 pA and s-value are observed. The simple back-channel defect termination using Thiourea solution offers the improved Cu2O-TFTs exhibiting the mobility of ∼1.81 cm2/Vs, s-values of ∼1.3 V/dec., and the on/off current ratio of ∼6.0 × 106.1 [115]. Min et al. [111] also demonstrated the improvement of Cu2OTFT performances by forming CuO back-channel layer and obtained field-effect mobility of ∼ 0.75 cm2/Vs, svalues of ∼ 0.11 V/decade, and the on/off current ratio of ∼2.81 × 108.\n\nFigure 7(c,d) also shows the VTC and the output voltage gains for oxide-CMOS inverter using the backchannel defect terminated p-channel Cu2O-TFT with nchannel a-IGZO-TFTs. The inverters exhibited a sharp and full signal switching with rail-to-rail output swings, and the maximum gain of 232 (Vdd = 70 V) (Figure 7 (d)). The improvement of the inverter characteristics was attrubuted to the improved device performances of p-Cu2O-TFT by back-channel defect termination, especially, the improvements of the s-value and the offcurrent. Therefore, improving the device performance\n\n![10_image_0.png](10_image_0.png)\n\n![10_image_1.png](10_image_1.png)\n\nof p-channel oxide-TFT is essential to develop highperformance all-oxide-TFT-based CMOS technology.\n\n## 4.3. Ambipolar Oxide-Tft-Based Cmos-Like Inverter\n\nBesides these oxide-TFT inverters above, the development progress of oxide-TFT-based CMOS inverter can be also confirmed in CMOS-like inverter using two identical ambipolar-TFTs, in which both electron and hole contribute the carrier conductions [125]. Therefore, ambipolar CMOS-like inverter is only one device that can be fabricated by a single material in the current oxide-TFT technology because there is no oxide semiconductor that can control the carrier types in electronic device quality level. The type of device is expected greatly to develop extremely cost-effective simple fabrication steps without any additional process steps such as the channel polarity control, the adjustment of Vth of TFTs, and advanced patterning of p and n-channelTFTs in separate regions. The process advantages also offer the development of high-density integrated device architectures for both planar and vertical geometric configurations. In addition, the unique electrical behavior operated in both the first and third quadrants is also promising to reduce complexity of circuit design and to develop novel logic circuits. Therefore, ambipolar-basedCMOS-like inverter has received much attention in these recent years [126,127].\n\nFigure 8 shows the equivalent circuit diagram for CMOS-like inverter and the schematic of the corresponding carrier flows before and after the output voltage inversion for the first (right) and third quadrants (left),\nwhich correspond to positive and negative inputs, respectively. The device can operate in both the positive and negative inputs and exhibits inverter actions in both the first and third quadrant regions by transiting p- and nchannel modes in both the TFTs. At 0 < VIN <VT for the first quadrant, the pull-up-TFT works as p-channel mode and only holes contribute to the current flow.While the pull-down-TFT operates in n-channel mode and is\n'off', but exhibits hole current flow. Therefore, the VOUT\ncannot fully swing to the supply voltage. AtVIN = Vdd/2, i.e. inverter threshold, only electrons and holes contribute the current in n-channel and p-channel modes, respectively. At VIN >VT, both devices behave as a unipolar device with only electrons contributing to the current flow, and the VOUT also cannot reach 0 V. Therefore, the VTC for ambipolar CMOS-like inverter shows a unique 'Z-shape'.\n\nSeveral organic ambipolar-TFTs such as CNT,\ngraphene, several organic semiconductor channels, have been fabricated. Since many oxide semiconductors have a wide-bandgap over 3.0 eV due to the nature of strong ionicity of chemical bonding, ambipolar behavior have been only currently observed in SnO\nwith a narrow bandgap of 0.7–0.8 eV [128]. Therefore, a bi-layered channel structure consisted of ntype oxide and p-type organic have been proposed for ambipolar-TFT, including n-channel such as aIGZO, ZnO, In2O3 with organic semiconductor channels. Note that the inverter is constructed by two identical single TFT with ambipolar channel using a bi-layered structure of n-oxide/p-organic semiconductors and distinguished from hybrid CMOS-inverter composed of p-channel organic-TFT and n-channel oxide-TFT as discussed in Section 4.1.\n\nTable 4 summarizes the details of device structure parameters and device performances for the reported CMOS-like inverter using ambipolar-TFT with oxide/\norganic-bi-layered channel. Liu *et al.* fabricated an ambipolar-TFTs with bi-layered channel made up of vertically stacked n-a-IGZO and p-pentacene and attained a high voltage gain as high as 60 in both the first and third quadrants of VTCs [129]. The ambipolar-TFT\nexhibited good performances such as electron mobility of 23.8 cm2/Vs and hole mobility of 0.15 cm2/Vs, respectively. Kim *et al.* [130] also fabricated ambipolarTFT using bi-layered channel comprised of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and amorphous Zinc–Tin oxide (ZTO) and demonstrated well-balanced electron and hole transport exhibiting electron mobility of 11.5 cm2/Vs and hole mobility of 4.2 cm2/Vs. The ambipolarTFT-based CMOS-like inverter exhibited a gain of >20.\n\nRecently, high voltage gain of 88 and 124 for the first and third quadrants in the VTC were achieved in ambipolar-TFT with bi-layered structured channel of aIGZO/C8-BTBT, which is semiconducting polymer with dioctylbenzothieno[2,3-b]benzothiophene [131].\n\nFigure 9 summarizes the TFT operation modes for the reported SnO-TFTs. Although the most reported SnO device is p-channel TFT, two types of operation modes, i.e. p-channel and ambipolar modes, are identified in the reported SnO-TFTs. A recent study clarified the origin of the different operation modes in the reported SnOTFTs, and back-channel surface defect density had a large responsibility of the TFT operation mode [138]. Figure 10(a) shows the variation of the transfer characteristics of SnO-TFTs with different back-channel defect density, which controlled by surface wet-etching with diluted Tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) and ALDAl2O3 passivation. The corresponding output characteristics are also shown in Figure 10(b). The pristine-TFTs without back-channel treatment show weak ambipolarity. Since the back-channel wet-etching induces extra back-channel defect over ∼1014 /cm2eV, the extra defect completely removes n-channel mode and produces\n\n| composed of bi-layered of n-channel oxide and p-channel organic. n-channel p-channel Mobility for n/p                                                                                                              | Gain for 1st/3rd   | NHH/NML for   |           |                  |         |         |                    |       |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|---------------|-----------|------------------|---------|---------|--------------------|-------|\n| Year                                                                                                                                                                                                               | material           | material      | (cm2/Vs)  | Vth for n/p (V)  | quads.  | Vdd (V) | 1st/3rd quads.

Therefore, the absence of ambipolarity in the reported p-channel SnO-TFTs is due to the presence of high-density back-channels defect. In contrast, the ALD-Al2O3 back-channel passivation improves n-channel transport, and makes the device exhibiting good symmetric ambipolar behavior. This is originated from the back-channel defect termination that can reduce to ∼1013 cm−2 eV−1.\n\nTable 5 summarizes the development progress of CMOS-like inverter using ambipolar SnO-TFTs. The obtained voltage gain of the first ambipolar SnO-TFTbased CMOS-like inverters was only ∼2.7 due to the unbalanced device performances for n- and p-channel modes [139]; specifically, the low mobility of n-channel mode. Significant improvement of the VTC by achieving the balanced performances of n- and p-channel mode was made by device passivation and remarkably high gain of 100 was attained by Luo et al. [140]. Figure 10(c,d) shows typical VTC and the corresponding voltage gain of ambipolar SnO-TFT-based CMOS-like inverters in first and third quadrants. Inverter actions are clearly observed in both first and third quadrant regions with the voltage gain of 64.1 ± 12.0 and 48.8 ± 6.8, respectively.\n\n## 5. Ring Oscillator Circuit Using Oxide-Tft Inverters\n\nNumerous demonstrations have been made in oxide-TFT\nand several inverter circuits such as flip-flop, ring oscillator (RO), shift register, logic gates (NAND and NOR\ngate), etc. These circuit-level demonstrations are also recognized as a benchmark for device quality of oxide-TFT\nand inverter. RO, which is constructed by odd numbers of inverting stage connected in series with the output feedback to the input, are fundamental building blocks used for clock oscillators, phase-locked loops, carrier frequency generator in a wide area of device applications such as computers and wireless communication devices.\n\nIt is also widely used as a fundamental circuit for evaluating the intrinsic speed of inverter logic process.\n\nTable 6 summarizes the device performances of RO\ncircuits using several types of oxide-TFT-based inverters. Several high-performance ROs using ZnO-TFT-based NMOS inverter were reported. Sun *et al.* fabricated 7stage RO with high operation frequency of >1 MHz with signal propagation delay <75 nsec/stage (Vdd = 32 V)\nby using ZnO-TFT (Mobility >15 cm2/Vs, Vth ∼ 14 V,\ns-value 0.5 V/dec., and on/off current ratio >108) [145].\n\nThe oscillation frequency (f) is inversely proportional to the number of stages (n), is strongly affected by the propagation delay (t) in each stage. Therefore, the f is giving by f = 1/2tn. Since the t directly links to the device performances of TFT elements, improving the TFT performances is significant for RO characteristics. Several approaches to improving the dynamic characteristics of TFT have been proposed. Fabricating short-channel devices to increase channel conductance is a primary strategy to improve the TFT operation speed. Zhao et al. developed the 1 μm-channel-length ZnO-TFT with the mobility of ∼20 cm2/Vs, Vth of ∼2 V, s-value of\n\n![13_image_0.png](13_image_0.png)\n\n| s-value for n/p   | NH / NM L for     |         |            |                  |                                   |                    |                   |       |\n|-------------------|-------------------|---------|------------|------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------|-------|\n| Mobility for n/p  | V th (Von) for    |         |            |                  |                                   |                    |                   |       |\n| Year              | (cm 2 /Vs)        | n/p (V) | (V/dec.)   | /on//off for n/p | Gain for 1st/3rd quads.

Since the overlapping of gate and source/drain electrodes is often the main source of parasitic capacitance, in general, a self-aligned coplanar TFT structure is promising to reduce parasitic capacitance. Rahaman et al. improved the gate/SD offset regions by fluorine doping in the coplanar-structure a-IGZO-TFTs ( W/L = 12\n/4 and 96/4 for load and drive-TFTs) and demonstrated 23-stages RO with a high f of 2.27 MHz ( V dd = 20 V) with a small t of 9.5 ns/stage [ 172 ].\n\n| inverters.

p-pentacene/n-ZnO-TFTs and p-CNT/n-a-IGZO-TFTs were also demonstrated. The 5-stage ROs using pCNT/n-a-IGZO-TFT hybrid-CMOS achieved good performances such as high f of 714 kHz and small t of 140 ns/stage [163]. Chen *et al.* also fabricated hybrid CMOS inverter composed of p-CNT (mobility of 8–15 cm2/Vs, and on/off current ratio of 105–106) and n-aIGZO (7–8 cm2/Vs, and 106–107) and developed a largescale microelectronic circuit (41,000 TFTs for 501-stage RO circuit) on the flexible substrate. They also successfully demonstrated various logic gates (inverter, NAND,\nand NOR gates), RO (from 51 to 501 stages), and dynamic logic circuits (dynamic inverter, NAND, and NOR gates) [161].\n\nLi *et al.* [173] also fabricated 51-satgae RO by using all-oxide-TFT-CMOS with the voltage gain of ∼120 made up of p-SnO-TFT (Mobility ∼0.87 cm2/Vs, Vth of −1.54 V, s-value of 1.55 V/dec., and on/off current ratio of 1.88 × 104)/a-IGZO-TFTs (10.23 cm2/Vs, 3.51 V, 0.66 V/dec, and 3 × 1.107) and successfully demonstrated the high f of 10 kHz and t of 1 μs/stage\n(Vdd = 10 V).\n\n## 6. Conclusions\n\nA review for the current oxide-TFT-based inverter technology, including unipolar NMOS, PMOS, CMOS, and ambipolar-TFT-based-CMOS-like inverters, was presented. Remarkable progress was clearly seen in all the types of oxide-TFT-based inverters, especially NMOS inverter using a-IGZO-TFT and all-oxide-TFT CMOS\ninverter composed of p-SnO/n-a-IGZO-TFTs and pCu2O/n-a-IGZO-TFTs. Moreover, a large-scale logic circuits beyond discrete device level and the cost-effective inkjet/print-processed logic circuit were also developed, and the high potentials of oxide-TFT-based inverter for broad fields of next-generation electronics such as flexible, wearable, transparent, low-power, low-cost, etc. were clearly demonstrated.\n\nThe comparison of inverter performances of several types of oxide-TFT-based inverters was summarized in Table 7. Since excellent n-channel oxide-TFT is available, the oxide-NMOS inverter is the most advanced among these oxide-TFT inverter technologies and move forward to the next stages such as large-scale circuit and device reliability test. Even though the TFT performance of pchannel oxide-TFT is not satisfactory yet, oxide-CMOS\n\n| Table 7. Comparison of device characteristics for several oxide-TFT-based inverter technology.

Relatively high voltage gain over 100 is also obtained in CMOS-like inverter using ambipolar-TFT, but it still requires a better understanding of ambipolar inverter operation and improve the fabrication process stability. PMOS inverter is largely behind other types.\n\nThe presented review shows that oxide-TFT technology is surely progressing to the next development level, but still several issues that should be addressed to advance to the next level remain. For the oxide-TFT NMOS inverter, effective doping methods to precisely control the donor level for the adjustment of Vth is highly demanded at the manufacturing levels. Since a rigid technology such as substitutional doping is not successful in a-IGZO channel yet, a furthermore understanding of material property including doping mechanism for oxide, particularly amorphous oxide, is vital, in addition to doping process development. Moreover, it clearly shows that the absence of high-performance pchannel oxide-TFTs hinders the high potential of oxideTFT technology for a broad field of next-generation electronic device applications. The development of pchannel oxide-TFT that exhibits comparable device performances with n-channel oxide-TFTs is indispensable for high-performance all-oxide-TFT-based CMOS technology. Several significant innovations to improve the device performances have been made so far. However, it still highly requires significant breakthroughs at the levels of material and device-level developments for p-channel oxide-TFTs to realize high-level integrated circuits using oxide-TFTs.\n\n## Disclosure Statement\n\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\n\n## Notes On Contributor\n\n![15_Image_0.Png](15_Image_0.Png)\n\nKenji Nomura received his PhD degree in Material science engineering from the Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo Tech), Japan in 2004.

        "text": "# Reliability Enhancement Of An Indium-Gallium-Zinc Oxide Thin-Film Transistor By Pre-Fluorination Non-Oxidizing Annealing\n\n## Sisi Wang, And Man Wong Department Of Electronic And Computer Engineering, The Hong Kong University Of Science And Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong Abstract\n\nTechniques of overcoming issues of device instability and negative turn-on voltage of an fluorinated indium-gallium-zinc oxide (IGZO) thin-film transistor have been investigated. Such improvement correlates with the annihilation of oxygen-related defects in the fluorinated channels. However, further extension of the fluorination time has been found to lead to degradation of some device characteristics. An alternative process has been proposed, involving the addition of a non-oxidizing anneal before the fluorination treatment. Consistenet with the higher fluorine content in the IGZO \nlayer revealed using secondary ion-mass spectrometry, more positive shift of the turn-on voltage and improvement in reliability have been obtained, without the TFT suffering from degradation in other device characteristics. \n\n## Author Keywords\n\nreliability, indium-gallium-zinc oxide; fluorination; annealing; positive bias temperature stress; thin-film transistors.\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nMetal-oxide thin-film transistors (TFTs), such as amorphous indiumgallium-zinc oxide (IGZO) TFTs are deployed in some flexible electronic systems and advanced flat-panel displays (1)(2). Techniques of overcoming instability issues and the negative turn-on voltage (on) \nof the IGZO TFT have been investigated to obtain higher performance and lower power consumption in these applications. Much work has been done on these issues of amorphous IGZO TFTs, especially on the influence of the annealing atmosphere and defect-passivation techniques (3)(4)(5). It has been reported that an IGZO TFT when fluorinated by exposure to a fluorine (F)-containing plasma resulted in the formation of fluorinated IGZO, i.e. IGZO:F. TFTs fabricated with IGZO:F have been shown to exhibit significantly a more positive on, higher resilience against hydrogen-induced degradation and improved reliability against electrical, thermal, and illumination stress (6)(7)(8). Motivated by the passivation of oxygen-related defects through plasma fluorination treatment (5)(7), and the benefits of the fluorin-containing plasma treatment reflected by a better reliability, IGZO:F TFTs subjected to longer plasma treatment have been studied. A processinduced limitation is revealed, putting a cap on the fluorination time . \n\nAn alternative fluorination process is presently proposed, demonstrating TFTs involving the addition of a non-oxidizing anneal (N2 at 400°C for 2 hrs) prior to the fluorination treatment. Correlates with the higher fluorine content in the channel region, the results exhibit with higher fluorine dose distributed in the active layer, further enhanced performance and improved stability. \n\n## 2. Experimental\n\nBottom-gate IGZO TFTs were fabricated on oxidized silicon wafers. 150-nm-thick molybdenum (Mo) layer was sputtered and patterned as the bottom gate electrode. The gate dielectric stack, consisting of 50nm SiNy and 75-nm SiOx, was deposited at 300°C in a plasmaenhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) reactor. A 25-nm-thick IGZO active layer was subsequently deposited at room temperature by radio-frequency magnetron sputtering using an IGZO target (Composition: In2O3:Ga2O3:ZnO = 1:1:1) in an atmosphere of 10% \noxygen (O2) and 90% argon at a total pressure of 3 mTorr. A group of the samples was then fluorinated in a tetrafluorocarbon (CF4) plasma at a power of 30 W in the same PECVD chamber, thus forming thin films of IGZO:F (IGZO+F); some samples of this group were annealed in nitrogen (N2) at 400°C for 2 hrs before the fluorination treatment (IGZO+N2+F); the rest of the samples was not fluorinated. All samples were subsequently covered with a layer of 50-nm-thick PECVD SiOx. After patterning of this SiOx cover layer in an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) etcher running a sulfur hexafluoride chemistry followed by etching of the IGZO in dilute hydrofluoric acid, the active islands of SiOx on IGZO were covered with a passivation layer of 250-nm SiOx deposited using the same PECVD process as that used for forming the gate dielectric. Subsequent to a thermal annealing at 400°C in O2 for 2 hrs, contacts to the source/drain (S/D) regions were opened in the same ICP etcher. A sputtered stack of gasimpermeable 50-nm Mo under 300-nm aluminum (Al) bilayer was patterned to form the S/D electrodes. Finally, elevated-metal metaloxide (EMMO) TFTs were realized by annealing at 400 °C in O2 for 4 hrs. In an EMMO TFT, the portion of the IGZO exposed to the oxidizing atmosphere through the gas-permeable SiOx forms the intrinsic active channel region, resulting from the passivation of the donor-defects (9). The portions of the IGZO covered under the gasimpermeable Al/Mo electrodes are converted to conductive, annealing-induced S/D regions. Consequently, the electrical channel length () of an EMMO TFT is defined by the separation between the metal electrodes (6)(9)(10). The electrical characteristics of the TFTs were measured using an Agilent 4156C Semiconductor Parameter Analyzer. The S/D electrodes were grounded during a PBTS measurement. SIMS depth profiles were obtained to determine the spatial distribution of the elements of interest.\n\n## 3. Results And Discussion\n\nMotivated by the better passivationof oxygen-related defects, which reflected by a better reliability, through a plasma fluorination treatment with an increasing of time (7), IGZO:F TFTs subjected to a plasma treatment time of a 15 mins has been studied. However, gate-control of the resulting TFTs was lost. The transfer characteristics of the resulting TFTs, i.e. the dependence of the drain current (d) on g were measured, with the source grounded and the drain biased at d=0.1 V. An g higher than 10 nA (even higher if not clamped by 4165C) was measured, as shown in Figure 1a and 1b. It was suspected that the degradation was induced by the penetration of excess F into the gate insulator layer underneath the active layer during the extended fluorination treatment, as illustrated in Figure 1c. Since non-oxidizing thermal annealing was proposed to result in the generation of an oxygen-deficient IGZO film (4)(9), its application prior to a fluorination process might help the film retain more of the F during a subsequent fluorination process, thus preventing F from penetrating to the underlying gate dielectrics. This possibility has been investigated in the present alternative process by the incorporation of a 400 °C, 2 hrs annealing in N2 prior to a 5-min fluorination process. The experimental design and the cross-section of the fabricated EMMO TFTs are illustrated in Figure 2. After the deposition of the IGZO active layer, a group of the samples was fluorinated in a CF4 squil most bobookrworl ' TS ' IZOE ' 65 plasma for 5 minutes, thus forming the reference IGZO+F; some samples of this group were annealed in N 2 at 400°C for 2 hrs before the same fluorination process (IGZO+N 2 +F); the rest of the samples was not fluorinated.\n\n![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)\n\n![1_image_2.png](1_image_2.png)\n\nShown in Figure 3 are the secondary ion-mass spectrometry (SIMS)\ndepth profiles of Si, In, Ga Zn, and F across the film stacks of SiOs/IGZO:F. The top and bottom boundaries of the IGZO:F are taken to be the locations where the intensities of Ga drop to 50% of its peak value. After normalizing the F density by the average In density across in the IGZO:F film (Fig. 3c), the alternative fluorination process\n(IGZO+N 2 +F) leads to higher F content in the resulting IGZO:F film.\n\nThe Von extracted from the resulting TFTs are shown in Figure 4.\n\nConsistent with previous studies, a more negative Von was observed for un-fluorinated TFTs with shorter L , such TFT with the shortest L =\n2 µ m has a Von of − 1.2 V, more negative than the near-zero Von for the long-channel TFTs with L = 10 and 100 µ m, where Von is defined as the Vg needed to induce an I d of 1 pA during a forward Vg -sweep. The negative shift of Von for short- L TFTs has been attributed to a higher carrier concentration induced by donor-defects spilling into the channel region from the S/D regions (10). After a 5-min fluorination treatment, the Von of a L = 2 µ m TFT was positively shifted to − 0.5 V; with the addition of a non-oxidizing anneal before the 5-min fluorination treatment, the Von was further positively shifted to 0.2 V. It can be seen clearly that the proposed process of IGZO:F TFT\n(IGZO+N 2+F) lead to the realization of enhancement-mode TFTs with a positive Von even for a short-channel TFT with L = 2 µ m.\n\n![1_image_1.png](1_image_1.png)\n\n![1_image_3.png](1_image_3.png)\n\ngide ou .

Compared with un-fluorinated IGZO (Fig. 5a) and the reference IGZO+F (Fig. 5b) obtained using a conventional fluorination schedule, the addition of a non-oxidizing pre-anneal to the fluorination process in a IGZO+N2+F TFT (Fig. 5c) \nled to the smallest negative shift in on after a 3000-s PBTS test: the corresponding on shifts were −3.4 V (Fig. 5a), −2.2 V (Fig. 5b), and \n−1.0 V (Fig. 5c) for these three types of TFTs. The improved stability is realized in the proposed process without the TFTs suffering from a loss of gate-control. \n\n## 4. Conclusion\n\nDifferent processes for the fluorination of IGZO TFTs have been investigated. While the degradation resulting from a positive bias thermal stress on an IGZO TFT can be significantly suppressed by increasing the fluorination treatment time, furether extension of the fluorination time resulted in loss of gate-control and higher gate leakage current, thus putting a cap on the fluorination time. Proposed presently is an alternative process of performing a non-oxidizing annealing of the IGZO film prior to the fluorination process. \n\nConsistenet with the higher fluorine content in the IGZO layer revealed using secondary ion-mass spectrometry, more positive shift of the turnon voltage and improvement in reliability have been obtained, without the TFT suffering from degradation in other device characteristics.\n\n## 5.

        "text": "# Remarkable Improvement Of **Electro-Mechanical Stabilities In** Flexible Oxide Tfts Under Bulk-Accumulation Operation\n\nMohammad Masum Billah, and Jin Jang\n\n![0_image_0.png](0_image_0.png)\n\nDepartment of Information Display and Advanced Display **Research Center,**\nKyung Hee University, Seoul, South Korea\n\n## Abstract\n\nWe demonstrate highly-robust flexible dual-gate (DG) a-IGZO TFTs on polyimide (PI) substrate. DG-driving TFTs exhibit robust mechanical stability as compared to SG-driving, which might be originated from the strain-limiting top-gate (TG) that efficiently modulates neutral-plane (NP). TCAD simulation confirms the improved stability of DG-TFTs due to smaller strain and increased electron concentration in a-IGZO channel *than* SG-driving TFTs. \n\n## Keywords\n\nAmorphous-indium-gallium-zinc-oxide (a-IGZO), thin-film transistor (TFT), dual gate driving (DG), Technology computeraided design (TCAD).\n\n## 1. **Introduction**\n\nThe studies on oxide thin-film transistors (TFTs) on a flexible substrate have been extensively carried out for the applications in transparent flat-panel displays because of many advantages over other commercially available semiconductor technologies such as low temperature process, high field effect mobility (, 2/ ∙\n), and large area deposition with low fabrication cost [1-2]. As a fundamental component of a flexible electronics system, the TFT with robust operation under mechanical bending is required, but there are many fundamental issues in LTPS TFTs because of their high process temperature, and the presence of grain boundaries \n(GB) that hinders the application of flexible large size panels [3-4].\n\nMoreover, the conventional flexible single gate (SG) a-IGZO TFTs have issues under electro-optical stress (NBIS) and also under mechanical bending strain due to the presence of intrinsic defects at unstressed state and generation of defects and physical cracks under electro-mechanical stress [5-7]. Especially, to achieve state of art robust flexible display, we need to overcome such important landmarks by the TFT architecture with dual gate (DG) under bulk accumulation (BA) mode [8].\n\nIn this work, we fabricated flexible SG and DG a-IGZO TFTs onto polyimide (PI) substrate (~15 μm). We performed a prolonged negative bias illumination stress (NBIS) (for 104s) and found that the DG-driving TFTs are less sensitive to NBIS having a threshold voltage shift (∆) of ~ − 2.5 V as compared to SG-driving TFTs \n(∆ ~ − 6.5 V). We introduced tensile mechanical bending strain (ε) on flexible devices by varying the bending radius (R) of 1~5 mm, measured the electrical performance and compared with the pristine TFT performance (Flat state, R = ∞ and ε = 0 %). \n\nSimilar to NBIS, DG-driving TFTs exhibit robust mechanical bending stability under an extreme bending strain (R = 1 mm, ε =\n0.8 %). We performed TCAD based strain distribution simulation for the flexible TFT devices and found significantly reduced strain on the a-IGZO layer for DG-driving TFTs, and the relationship between the TG electrode thickness and strain distribution has been found.\n\n## 2. **Device Fabrication And Experiment**\n\nFig. 1(a) and (b) represents the cross-sectional views of flexible a-IGZO TFTs with SG and DG structures on 15 μm polyimide (PI) substrate, respectively. The detailed TFT fabrication process on PI substrate appears elsewhere [9]. The PI was spin-coated on carrier glass, followed by curing at ∼450 °C for 1 h. The fabricated TFT\narray on the flexible PI substrate was mechanically detached from the carrier glass using a mechanical roller [9]. Finally, we performed vacuum annealing for the TFTs at 250 °C for 2 h. Fig. 1(c)-(e) shows the optical images of TFT arrays after mechanical detachment, for electrical measurements at flat and under tensile strain on cylinders with various radii.\n\nequil mort bobaolerwocl. 1 , 610E , 6510E9\n(sequi) emitted) but attroT arts soE (42026661) no yandLi shifto railW , gierovid nant rd 26821 aphr6001.01/int/mco.gailw , gand a vates.

I sail nO valiW no (enoblico-bino-ann For the TFT simulation, Silvaco's process simulator, Athena and Devedit were used to create flat and bendable TFT structures, respectively. An arbitrary radius (R) was chosen to create bendable TFT structure. For mechanical strain (ε) distribution, we performed 3-D victory stress distribution module of Silvaco TCAD( TM ) and the mechanical properties of PI substrate and the TFT layers are listed in TABLE-I. We demonstrated Silvaco's Atlas simulating module to achieve I-V characteristics fitting and carrier concentration (n)\ndistribution of a-IGZO layer on flat or bendable TFT. The density of state (DOS) model was taken for a-IGZO material reported before [10]. The TFT channel width (W) and channel length (L) are 20 µ m and 6 µ m, respectively.\n\nElectrical characteristics of the fabricated TFTs were measured in dark at room temperature, using an Agilent 4156C semiconductor analyzer at a drain voltage (V,) = 0.1 V. We define V,,, as the gate voltage ( V G ) corresponding to drain current ( I D ) of W/L×10 pA at a VD = 0.1 V. The subthreshold swing, SS (V/dec) was obtained as\n( ˆ θ logI D /ˆ θV G ) − 1 over the range of 10 pA ≤ I D ≤ 100 pA, with V D =\n0.1 V.\n\nTFT field-effect mobility ( μ FE ) was retrieved from transconductance ( ∂ I D /∂V G ), and plotted as a function of gate voltage ( V G ).\n\n## 3. Results And Discussions\n\nFig. 2(a)-(b) shows the comparison of NBIS measurement results between SG-driving and DG-driving TFTs. NBIS was performed under prolonged light irradiation (for 10 4 s) using ultraviolate (UV) light emitting diode (LED) with a wavelength of ~365 nm and intensity of 0.7 mW/cm 2 in addition to the gate voltage\n(V G = − 20 V). We periodically interrupted NBIS to measure the I-\nV characteristics. Consistent with the previous reports, NBIS results in a negative shift of Δ V TH ( V ). It can be seen in Fig. 2(a)-(b) that compared to TFTs with single gates (SG-driving), DG TFTs under\n\n![1_image_1.png](1_image_1.png)\n\nDG-driving exhibit less negative AVTH(V) shift after the application of NBIS (SG TFT: AVTH = -6.5 V, DG TFT: AVTH =\n−2.5 V) as shown in Fig. 3(a). The better NBIS stability that is achieved by DG-diving has been previously attributed to a high gate drive, resulting in turn-on voltages close to zero volts, regardless of small changes in DOS [8].\n\nFig. 2(c)-(d) represents the TFT transfer characteristics at different bending radius (R (mm)) at V D = 0.1 V for SG and DG-driving TFTs, respectively. The change in mechanical bending radius (R)\nleads to vary the tensile mechanical strain ( ε ). The pristine TFT\nperformance is checked in flat geometry after detaching the TFT\narray on PI substrate using a mechanical roller [9]. Then, the flexible TFTs were wound around the cylinders of various radii\n(R = 5 mm to R = 1 mm). It is clearly observed from I-V curves that DG-driving TFTs exhibit robust electrical stability as compared to SG TFTs (SG TFT: AVTH = − 1.4 V, DG TFT: AVTH = − 0.5 V)\nas shown in Fig. 3(b). Moreover, we did not observe any noticeable change in device ON/off ratio and any visible cracks from optical microscopic images (not shown here). In addition, DG-driving TFTs exhibit robust p FF under NBIS and also under mechanical strain experiments as compared to SG TFTs in Fig. 3(c)-(d),\nsuggesting that DG-driving method excellent respectively, candidate for next generation display applications.\n\nThe concept of \"neutral plane (NP)\" is very crucial in flexible TFT\nanalysis under mechanical deformation. From the physical point of view, NP is the plane inside a flexible TFT on which, the external applied mechanical strain ( ɛ ) effect is analytically zero [11]. When the flexible TFTs are subjected to external mechanical strain, our best design goal is to keep the NP closer to a semiconducting layer in a TFT to achieve robust TFT performance. We adopted DG TFT structure to modulate the NP without adding thicker encapsulation layer [9, 12].\n\n![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)\n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)\n\n 21680159, 2019, 1, Downloaded from https://sid.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sdtp.12892 by Jinan University, Wiley Online Library on [16/06/2024].

This important finding might lead us to achieve less strain distribution on a-IGZO layer inside flexible DG-TFTs in Fig. 4(d). Moreover, Fig. 4(c) represents the influence of material properties (especially young's Modulus) to modulate neutral plane (NP) of flexible dual gate (DG) TFTs. We considered the same layer by layer DG TFT dimension except the metal electrodes (gates, source and drain). We adopted young's modulus of Au, from previously reported publications and using eq. (1) and (2), we calculated the NP position. It has been observed from NP calculation that CNT electrode based TFTs might have a NP very close to the TFT film (although we need experimental investigation to confirm). Therefore, a metal electrodes higher Young's modulus might be beneficial for the absorption of the applied strain by modulating the neutral plane (NP) position.\n\nFig. 5 shows the changes in simulated carrier concentration (n) \nalong the 20 nm a-IGZO channel layer at ′ depth line. We simulated and compared the changes in carrier concentration bent structures between SG and DG TFTs for  = 20 V and  = 0.1 V. \n\nIt has been found that the carrier concentrations in both bent SG and DG TFTs are higher than the flat geometry which might be the origin of increased  after bending [18]. We did not observe any physical damage after measuring the TFTs under bending strain with a bending radius down to 1 mm. Moreover, the maximum strain distribution at the center of the channel might lead to generate more ionized oxygen vacancy states (VOVO\n+/VO\n2+) from neutral oxygen vacancies [18, 19] and thus, SG TFTs might exhibit more instabilities upon bending.\n\n4. **Conclusion**\nIn conclusion, we demonstrate highly-robust flexible dual-gate \n(DG) a-IGZO TFTs on 15 μm thick polyimide (PI) substrate. DGdriving TFTs exhibit robust electro-optical stress (NBIS) and mechanical bending stability as compared to SG-driving, which might be originated from the strain-limiting top-gate (TG) electrode that efficiently modulates neutral-plane (NP) near to TFT film. Numerical simulation using TCAD confirms the improved stability of DG-TFTs due to remarkably increased electron concentration at the bulk and also near the interfaces than SG-driving TFTs.\n\n![3_image_0.png](3_image_0.png)\n\n## 5. **Acknowledgments**\n\nThis work was supported by the Technology Innovation Program \n(or Industrial Strategic Technology Development Program\n(10080454, Development of High-resolutions OLED MicroDisplay and Controller SoC for AR/VR Device) funded By the Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy (MOTIE, Korea).\n\n## 6. **References**\n\n[1].

Therefore, we have every reason to believe that top-gate will be more potential than bottom gate. \n\nIn this paper, we have studied the effects of different doping methods on Top-Gate IGZO TFT , and so far, there have no paper which have given the system description and summary about it . \n\n## 2. Experiment\n\nFigure1 shows the staggered structure of Top-Gate IGZO TFT. \n\nGlass with sizes of 730mm x 920mm x 0.5mm was used as the substrate material in Gen 4.5 system. Firstly, molybdenum(Mo) deposited and patterned on substrate as light shield layer ,SiOx buffer layer deposited,IGZO active layer deposited and patterned upper the buffer layer ,which was composed of In2O3:Ga2O3:ZnO =1:1:1 mol%,then ,doped the activelayer of IGZO with N2O、N2 or O2 , and deposited SiOx as gate insulating layer (GI), Al/ Mo as gate layer , patterned gate electrode, fabricated the low resistance contact area of S/D by AL \n、Ar、SiNx、He or No doping ,deposited SiOx intermediate layer, and patterned the Via hole, finally , Mo/ Al/ Mo deposited and etched to form source and drain electrode. Before the \n\n![0_image_0.png](0_image_0.png) experiment, we carried out the single pass process adjustment, and obtained the IGZO'S RS to reach E+3 (Ω/sq) level with He/Ar/Al/SiNx doping .All the experimental data was measured at Agilent B1505A, TFT's W/L=6/12. this work \n\n## 3. Result\n\nFigure2 and Table1 show doping the active layer of Top-Gate IGZO TFT with N2O,which can improve the uniformity of the electrical properties of the whole substrate obviously from 13.5V to 2.9V, The main reason is N* in N2O supplemented the dangling bond in IGZO,and O* in N2O improved the uneven concentration of O* in IGZO. At the same time, The TFT's mobility reduced and Vth appered a certain degree of positive drift , The main reason is excessive doping leads to decrease of free electrons in IGZO .and doping IGZO active layer with N2 and O2 have not so good results as N2O.\n\n![0_image_1.png](0_image_1.png) \nFig.2 The electrical uniformity befor and after N2O treating IGZO activelayer(Vd=10V) (a)Before Treatment \n(b)After Treatment \n\n| Mobility                                                | SS        |        |         |      |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------|--------|---------|------|\n| Item                                                    | (V/dec) | Vth(V) | ΔVth(V) |      |\n| (cm2/VS)                                              |           |        |         |      |\n| Before                                                  |           |        |         |      |\n| Treatment                                               | 12.13     | 0.34   | 2.55    | 13.5 |\n| After                                                   |           |        |         |      |\n| Treatment                                               | 6.5       | 0.33   | 6.80    | 2.9  |\n| Tab.1 The electrical data befor and after N2O doped the |           |        |         |      |\n\nFigure3 and Table2 show the IdVg electrical property obtained by different S/D doping methods after N2O doped IGZO active layer, Al doped and SiNx doped Top-Gate devices have the best IdVg properties, and the mobilty is higher one magnitude than undoped devices, The main reason is Al captured oxygen in IGZO and generated stable V-O at S/D of TFTs [3], leading decrease of contact resistance of S/D. The latter is mainly due to the diffusion of H* in SiNx, ( H0(from outside)+O2-(in IGZO)->-OH-(in IGZO)+e-),leading decrease of contact resistance of S/D. However, doping with He and Ar has not obvious improvement to the device's IdVg properties, the main reason is that the V-O of S/D by bombardment emerged a certain extent thermal recovery.\n\nIn addition ,S/D doped Al have obviously improvement to the Vth of devices, the main reason is that Al consumed part of oxygen in IGZO overly doped in IGZO by N2O Plasma treatment ,which makes the oxygen concentration and ratio in IGZO more reasonable . The SS of doped and undoped S/D's devices is basically consistent, because the SS mainly depends on the device structure. \n\nFig.3 The IdVg electrical curves obtained by different S/D \n\n![1_image_1.png](1_image_1.png)\n\n![1_image_2.png](1_image_2.png)\n\ndoping methods(Vd=10V)\n\n| Doping Methods                                             | Mobility    |        |       |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|--------|-------|\n| (cm2/VS)                                                 | SS(V/dec) | Vth(V) |       |\n| of S/D Al                                                  | 8.60        | 0.26   | 2.90  |\n| He                                                         | 3.2         | 0.33   | 10.37 |\n| No Doping                                                  | 1.73        | 0.32   | 8.95  |\n| Ar                                                         | 2.74        | 0.22   | 10.02 |\n| SiNx                                                       | 6.5         | 0.23   | 8.84  |\n| Tab.2 The electrical data obtained by different S/D doping |             |        |       |\n\nobtained by different S/D doping methods (Bias=±30V,\nT=80℃, Backlight=4500Nit,2000S,W/L=6/12), Al doped Top-gate device shows good device stability (a), ΔVthNBTIS in 2000S=1.54V and ΔVth**PBTIS in 2000S** =5.28V , the main reason is that Al doping can generate not only stable oxygen vacancies, but also less defects of S/D . Doping S/D with Ar or He, plasma will causes defects in the surface of S/D \nof IGZO ,Resulting in a decrease in device's stability (b/d).

Firstly, an introduction to n-type oxide TFTs is provided with a focus on the development of active-layer material combinations from binary oxide active layers, like zinc oxide and indium oxide, to ternary and quaternary oxide active layers formed by doping with elements such as gallium or tin to achieve high mobility and high device stability for TFTs.

Introduction\n\nAtomic layer deposition (ALD) is a process that was developed to enable thin film deposition over a large area with good uniformity. This is achieved due to its basic selflimiting characteristics; in other words, unlike other deposition techniques, ALD proceeds via self-limiting reactions between precursor chemicals and the substrate (as shown in Fig. 1).1 Basically, ALD consists of four essential steps: (1)\nprecursor exposure to the substrate, (2) evacuation or purging of the precursors as well as byproducts from the chamber, (3) reactant species exposure, typically oxidants or other reagents, and (4) evacuation or purging of the reactants and byproduct molecules from the chamber.2 During these surface reactions and the layer by layer growth cycle, the ALD process exhibits some important properties for nanofabrication: excellent conformality, atomic scale thickness control, and low growth temperature. Despite the similarities between conventionally used chemical vapor deposition and ALD, the distinctive and clear feature of ALD lies in the self-limiting nature of precursor adsorption and reaction. The sequential, alternating exposure of precursors and reactants results in the unique characteristics of the ALD process.3 In the early stage of ALD development, applications of ALD were limited to the deposition of epitaxial layers of II–VI or III–V semiconductors, since the inherently low growth rate was considered to be a major hurdle for other applications.4 On the other hand, ALD grown aluminum oxide, hafnium oxide, and titanium oxide as well as mixtures of those were also used as the dielectric layers of a doubleinsulator electroluminescent device.4,5 However, because of the required down-scaling of semiconductor device dimensions, ALD grown nanoscale thin films have found new applications in metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs), solar cells, and high-density memory devices. Furthermore, because it can meet the requirements of small pixel size and large panel area growth as well as low deposition temperature, the ALD method will be considered as an important deposition technique for next generation display technologies including mobile terminals, large sheetshaped televisions, and flexible products. It remains a significant challenge to produce such devices with higher resolution, lighter weight, lower power consumption, lower thickness, and a free design form.6 Regarding display operation, many researchers have paid attention to thin film transistor (TFT) fabrication processes, for which high mobility, on-off current modulation, low contact resistance, and even mechanical flexibility are important considerations.7,8 Hydrogenated amorphous silicon\n(a-Si:H) TFTs have been extensively investigated; however, device performance is limited by their low mobility (<1 cm2/\nV s).9–11 Low-temperature polycrystalline silicon (LTPS)\nTFTs have also attracted attention due to their high electrical mobility values close to 100 cm2/V s. However, the nonuniform spatial distribution of the poly-Si grain structure in LTPS films, which results in non-uniform device performance,12–14 as well as high production costs limit their application in next generation displays.15,16 Besides, interest in Si-based devices for transparent circuits has been waning due to their small bandgap. In contrast, degenerate band conduction and large mobility (>10 cm2/V s) are possible in amorphous oxide semiconductors (AOS) containing post-transition-metal cations, which are completely different from those of the covalent semiconductors.17,18 Previous research on oxide TFTs has usually been based on sputter or solution phase deposition methods. Such methods have some shortcomings in contrast to ALD, such as unavoidable high-temperature annealing, infeasibility of a)Electronic mail: jsparklime@hanyang.ac.kr\n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)\n\naccurate composition adjustment and thickness control, and also difficulties with large area thin film deposition, which may result in device performance degradation.19 On the other hand, n-type oxide TFTs fabricated using ALD show a performance comparable to that of sputtered TFTs in previous reports, such as zinc oxide (ZnO) TFTs with a mobility of 30 cm2/V s,20 indium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO) TFTs with a mobility of 10 cm2/V s,21 and indium zinc oxide (IZO) TFTs with a mobility of 42.1 cm2/V s.22 In addition to the great success of ALD n-type oxide semiconducting materials in TFT applications, p-type oxide semiconducting materials grown by ALD have also attracted much attention. Complementary metal oxide semiconductor inverters, which comprise both p- and n-type TFTs as the basic building blocks for complex integrated circuits for system-on-chip devices, can be realized only if superior p-type materials are found.\n\nIn this paper, we provide an introduction to recent developments in ALD oxide TFT research, including n-type oxide semiconductor combinations and p-type active layers. It should be noted that the oxide semiconductor active layer of TFT that deposited by sputtering, solution, or other processes will not include in this paper, while there are several excellent review papers on such content in terms of the device fabrication process by Park's group23 and Jeong's group.24\n\n## Ii. N-Type Oxide Material Combinations For Active Layers\n\nSince the demonstration of flexible amorphous IGZO\nTFTs by Nomura et al.,18 tremendous efforts have been made in the research of n-type AOS TFT devices, especially for next generation flat panel display applications. The sputtering technique is the most commonly used method for preparing TFT oxide semiconductor films because of its higher performance and superior electrical or photo stability compared to the counterpart of the solution-based processing.25,26 Besides, multicomponent AOS materials, like IGZO\n(Ref. 27) and indium tin zinc oxide (ITZO) (Ref. 28), can be easily deposited via sputtering process once the target ratio is modified, which are its merits as well as demerits as the composition of the sputtered active layer cannot be adjusted freely. In addition, research into 3D vertical TFT fabrication on polymer films using ALD has been conducted for future non-glass 3D displays as well as flexible displays, where extremely small pixel sizes and low deposition temperatures with large area deposition are necessary.29 Unlike Si-based semiconductors that use ion doping to control charge carrier concentrations in a thin film, for n-type AOS materials, the bottom of the conduction band that is highly ionized is primarily composed of spatially spread metal ns orbitals with isotropic shapes, where n is the principal quantum number, and direct overlap among the neighboring metal ns orbitals is possible. The magnitude of this overlap is insensitive to the distorted metal-oxygen-metal (M-O-M) chemical bonds that intrinsically exist in amorphous materials, which leads to a similar Hall Effect mobility to that of the corresponding crystalline phase.18,30,31 In this section, we review the development of n-type AOS\nTFTs fabricated by ALD. Recent reports of n-type AOS TFTs are summarized in Table I.\n\n## A. Zno-Based Active-Layer Materials 1.

reactant. As ALD ZnO thin films usually have a high carrier concentration as well as defect states, research has generally focused on the thickness,37 growth temperature,40,54,92 and post treatment methods, including UV exposure,85 post annealing processes,89,91 and O2 plasma treatment.36 The electrical properties of ZnO thin films depend on the ALD growth temperature,54 as shown in Fig. 2(a), where the measured carrier concentration and Hall mobility increased and resistivity decreased with increasing deposition temperature. Generally, the appropriate carrier concentration for the channel layer of an oxide TFT is 1014–1017 cm−3, 109 which implies as-grown ZnO thin films deposited at >150 °\nC are not appropriate for TFT applications. Generally, the higher carrier concentrations obtained at higher growth temperatures of n-type oxide semiconductors are attributed to the oxygen vacancies (Vo). The Vo is widely reported to be created through the reaction: Oo → 1/2 O2 + Vo + e−,\nwhich is supposed to happen at higher growth temperatures.\n\nIt should be noted that the local density approximation calculations showed an oxygen defect works as an electron\n\n![4_image_0.png](4_image_0.png)\n\ntrap as well as a shallow donor depending on its local structure, explained by singly ionized state (VO\n+) by VO ↔ VO\n+ +\ne\n− or doubly ionized state (VO\n2+) by VO\n+ ↔ VO\n2+ + e−. Thus, the shallow donorlike oxygen vacancy helps carrier concentration generation and mobility development. On the other side, the deep oxygen defects have essential influence on device stability performance. When a bias is applied to the device, electron capture is favored because the induced positive vertical field raises EF closer to EC. This case can be explained by VO\n+ + e− ↔ VO, where transit VO\n+ or VO\n2+ back to VO.\n\n110–112 Thus, many researchers choose a post annealing treatment in air or oxygen-rich atmosphere to reduce the carrier concentration by reversing the reaction mentioned above. As shown in Fig. 2(b), even though the dependence of carrier concentration and resistivity of ZnO thin films on growth temperature after post annealing (250 °C) follows the same trend as the as-deposited thin films, their values were significantly decreased from 1019 to 1017 cm−3 (150 °C). The post annealed ZnO thin films grown at different temperature were used to fabricate TFTs and the related device transfer curves and performance parameters are shown in Figs. 2(c) and 2(d), respectively. The transfer curves display on/off switching operation and appropriate performance\n(mobility up to 7 cm2/V s above a growth temperature of 150 °C) owing to the O2 annealing process. However, the impurities existing in the ZnO thin film grown at low temperature, and crystallization and high carrier concentration at high temperature result in device performance degradation, including mobility dropping, subthreshold slope rising, and\n\n## 2. Al/Hf-Doped Zno\n\nThe first typical doping material used in ZnO is Al, which is a donor material. It is reported that doping Al into ZnO can result in a transparent conducting oxide material with high carrier concentrations at normal deposition temperatures. Maeng et al. studied Al-doped ZnO thin films using ALD and confirmed that the lower deposition temperature could not supply enough activation energy for carrier generation based on analysis of Arrhenius plots of the dependence of carrier concentration on deposition temperature, and finally fabricated Al-doped ZnO TFTs with a mobility of 1.95 cm2/V s deposited at 100 °C.40 Better performing ALD Al-doped ZnO TFTs were fabricated by Ahnand Kim,38 where an Al-doped ZnO thin film was deposited at 110 °C and the device was annealed at 200 °C for 30 min. They performed a combinatorial study of doping concentration using Al and reported that the highest mobility can be obtained by 1% Al doping and the best reliability can be obtained using 5% Al doping. As shown in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b), the mobility decreased and threshold voltage was shifted positively when the Al doping concentration was raised, which was explained by carrier concentration suppression. On the other hand, the improved electrical stability was attributed to the coarsening of the crystal size and the preferred orientation along the nonpolar direction afforded by the addition of Al.\n\n![5_image_0.png](5_image_0.png)\n\nSpecifically, the instability of ZnO-based TFTs is still a difficult problem to solve which is generally attributed to the defects contained in the bulk active layer as well as in the interface of the active layer and the insulator layer. 113 as reviewed by Conley 114 To obtain highly stable ZnO-based TFTs, some papers have reported using Hf as a doping mate-\nAs shown in Figs. 3 (c)\nrial for ALD ZnO TFTs. 48 , 61 , 79 , 97 and 3(d) , HfZnO TFTs can be fabricated by ALD using DEZ\nand tetrakisethylmethylaminohafnium as Zn and Hf sources and DI water as an oxygen source at a deposition temperature\n\n![5_image_1.png](5_image_1.png)\n\n![6_image_0.png](6_image_0.png)\n\nof 150 °C.79 Although the field effect mobility slightly decreased from 11.3 to 9.4 cm2/V s as Hf content was increased due to the higher oxygen binding energy of Hf ions compared to Zn ions, which suppressed the generation of oxygen-vacancy-related defects, the stability under gate bias with temperature stress was significantly improved. This is attributed to the reduced density of states (DOS) calculated based on the experimentally obtained activation energy (Ea).\n\n## B. Inox-Based Active-Layer Materials 1. Inox\n\nIndium oxide (InOx) has also been reported to be a potential candidate active-layer material in TFT devices because of its high mobility n-type character originating from the single free electronlike band of the In 5s state.115–117 The electrical characteristics of InOx thin films, grown by an ALD method using [1,1,1-trimethyl-N-(trimethylsilyl) silanaminato]-indium (InCA-1) as the indium source and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as an oxidant, also exhibit a strong dependence on the growth temperature.118 As shown in Fig. 4, it has been reported that InOx films act like TCO\nfilms at growth temperatures higher than 200 °C due to their relatively low electrical resistivity (∼10−4 Ω cm) and high optical transparency (>85%). Low resistivity at high growth temperature is supposed to be attributed to the high carrier concentration resulting from its crystallinity and molecular orbital ordering. On the other hand, at relatively low growth temperatures below 150 °C, indium oxide behaves as a transparent semiconducting oxide so that the related TFT devices exhibit reasonably high performance with a saturation mobility exceeding 15 cm2/V s and a threshold voltage near 0 V.\n\nAs the as-deposited InOx generally exhibits metal-like conduction, the total carrier concentration can be reduced not only by decreasing growth temperature but also by some other methods, such as annealing in an oxygen-rich environment,104 exposure to N2O plasma,74 or doping with high oxygen affinity metal cations.80\n\n## 2. Zn/Ga-Doped Inox\n\nA homogeneous laminated IZO active layer was reported by Park's group, as shown in Fig. 5, which was grown using the concept of an IZO supercycle, containing one ZnO cycle and one In2O3 cycle, using InCA-1 and DEZ as metal sources and H2O2 as an oxidant. The electrical performance of IZO TFTs deposited at different temperatures (150–200 °\nC) were evaluated.22 The higher mobility and stability of IZO TFTs deposited at a higher temperature are supposed to be due to the larger amount of shallow donor states,\n\n| spectroscopic ellipsometry and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES)].

It was reported that a discrepancy appeared between the actual growth of IZO and the sum of the respective binary oxides, which increased at higher deposition temperatures. 22 Two surface reaction cases were proposed for the In 2 O 3 cycle, where higher temperature may cause the InCA-1 precursor to release an additional CH 3 ligand so that In bonds to two -OH sites. During the following ZnO cycle, the number\n\n![7_image_1.png](7_image_1.png)\n\n![8_image_0.png](8_image_0.png)\n\nof -OH sites on the surface is reduced, resulting in a suppressed ZnO growth rate at high growth temperatures despite the increased reactivity.\n\nThe growth mechanism was further examined in a study of ALD indium gallium oxide (IGO) TFTs. 8 Table II displays the growth rate and chemical composition of ALD grown IGO thin films using trimethylgallium\n(TMGa) and InCA-1 as the gallium and indium sources. No growth of gallium oxide was detected when the GaO sequence was applied, while varying Ga compositions were observed when an InCA-1 pulse was included in the sequence and a reactant pulse was launched before and after the sequential metal precursor pulses. The mechanism behind these different reactivities was explained by density functional theory, showing that adsorption of TMGa on the hydroxylated InOx surface would be spontaneous and irreversible.\n\nThe IGO TFTs were fabricated in a top-gate bottomcontact structure, as shown in Fig. 6 , using different supercycles composed of InO x and GaO subcycles to control the atomic composition as well as electrical characteristics, such as carrier concentration and resistivity. The ALD IGO\nTFT achieved an optimum mobility of 9.45 cm 2 /V s with a in previous reports of sputter deposited IGO TFTs.\n\n## C. Multicomposition Active-Layer Materials\n\nAOS, which are based on ternary and quaternary zinc compounds (e.g., InGaZnO and InZnSnO), can have their electrical properties fine-tuned by varying the composition ratio of metal ions. Basically, amorphous indium gallium zinc oxide (a-InGaZnO) is the most widely utilized AOS for the active channel in TFTs due to its reasonably large\n\n![8_image_1.png](8_image_1.png)\n\n![9_image_1.png](9_image_1.png)\n\nmobility (μ > 10 cm2/V s), low off-currents due to good controllability of the carrier concentration over a wide range\n(1015–1019 cm−3), and long-term stability.18,119 Recently, several papers reported on thermal ALD IGZO\nTFTs81,120 as well as spatial ALD IGZO TFTs.21,82 The nucleation and growth of InGaZnO thin films by spatial atmospheric ALD were investigated by Illiberi's group, using DEZ, trimethyl indium (TMIn), triethyl gallium\n(TEGa), and water as metal precursors and oxygen precursors.21 The morphology of the films changes from polycrystalline, for ZnO and In-doped ZnO, to amorphous for In-rich IZO and InGaZnO. As the XRD spectra shown in Fig. 7(a), ZnO has a polycrystalline structure with (002) and (100) main orientations and the incorporation of In-atoms into the ZnO lattice induces a decrease in the intensity of the crystalline peaks and a shift of the (100) peak positions toward lower angles and finally results in an anamorphous thin film structure as the In-content is further increased. These changes are generally reported121–124 and can be explained by the creation of crystallographic defects by In-atoms. On the other hand, the use of these films as the active channel in TFTs has been demonstrated and the influence of In and Ga\n\n![9_image_0.png](9_image_0.png)\n\ncations on the electrical characteristics of the TFTs has been studied, as shown in Fig. 7(b).\n\nThe influence of growth temperature on thermal ALD\nIGZO TFTs also has been investigated. The IGZO film composition was analyzed after deposition using an indium–\ngallium single precursor, DEZ, and ozone. The results are exhibited in Fig. 7(c) where the atomic ratio of In:Ga:Zn was kept at 1:1:3 for all temperature conditions (from 130 to 170 °C). The amounts of oxygen-related defects such as oxygen vacancies increased with increasing ALD temperature, which explains the carrier mobility in the saturation regions (μsat's)\nfor the fabricated TFTs using the IGZO channel layers, which were estimated to be 6.1–14.8 cm2/V s with increasing ALD temperature [Fig. 7(d)]. It should be noted that the obtained device characteristics were sufficiently comparable to those of the conventional sputter-deposited IGZO TFTs.\n\nTraditional InGaZnO is now facing a crisis as the mobility is generally limited to approximately 10 cm2/V s, which is insufficient for the increasing requirements of high resolution, high response speed displays.125,126 Physically, doping of SnOx to InZnO is expected to increase the mobility due to the increased orbital overlap and conduction band dispersion by the large 5s orbital of Sn4+ and, at the same time, improve the physical and chemical stability of the devices, thanks to the larger bond-dissociation energy (528 kJ/mol).28,127 Thus, indium zinc tin oxide (IZTO) as a typical n-type semiconductor material has been suggested as a promising candidate due to its relatively high field effect mobility values close to 30 cm2/V s and superior stability compared to IGZO TFTs.\n\nInOx and ZnO were grown one cycle at a time in alternating sequences throughout the entire IZO thin film, while\n\n| TABLE III.

The amorphous IZTO thin films deposited by ALD were found to contain large amounts of carriers and fewer deep oxygen defect sites compared to the ALD IZO\nthin films. The electronic structures were examined and simulated, attributing the superior electrical properties to the increased electron activity (value of EC − EF from 0.73 to 0.53 eV) and decreased number of oxygen related defect sites. Such superior properties contribute to device performance resulting in the improvement of the mobility and stability of IZTO TFTs from 19.2 to 26.8 cm2/V s and from ΔVth of 1.8 V to 0.7 V compared to IZO TFTs, as shown in Fig. 8(b).\n\n## Iii. P-Type Materials For Active Layers\n\nFor the n-type oxide materials, oxygen vacancies could easily generate electron carriers. Also, the electronic configuration of the conduction-band minimum mainly consists of metal s orbitals, which means electrons are delocalized so that n-type oxide materials could have high electron concentrations and mobilities.18,128 On the other hand, for p-type oxide materials, the situation is quite different. The high formation energy of metal cation vacancies and low anion formation energy limits the generation of hole carriers.129 Also, the main pathway for the hole carriers, the valence-band minimum (VBM), consists of anisotropic, localized oxygen p orbitals. Owing to these properties, the mobility of hole carriers is low.130,131 Although it is difficult to fabricate p-type oxide materials with good performance, there are a few candidates such as Cu-based oxides (binary and ternary Cu oxides) and tin monoxide. When the ALD method is applied to deposit p-type materials, owing to the characteristics of ALD, the composition of the thin films can easily be controlled by combining different ALD cycles to fabricate binary, ternary, or even quaternary compounds. Furthermore, phase engineering could be easily achieved via adapting different ALD\nprocess.132 Besides, due to the size scaling requirement of electronic device, the precise thickness control and highly uniform growth of thin films are needed, ALD process will certainly become the strongest candidate for p-type oxide semiconductor deposition. Recent reports of ALD p-type oxide are summarized in Table III.\n\n## A. Copper Oxide\n\nCuprous oxide (Cu2O) with a cubic crystal structure\n[Fig. 9(a)] has p-type characteristics with a high Hall mobility exceeding 100 cm2/V s.133,134 The p-type characteristics of Cu2O come from Cu vacancies (VCu) and interstitial oxygen (Oi).135 As shown in Fig. 9(b), the valence band of Cu2O consists of fully occupied Cu 3d and O 2p hybrid orbitals, which are less localized than the O 2p orbitals of most oxide materials.135 These hybridized orbitals act as a hole conducting pathway, so that Cu2O can exhibit a high Hall mobility.\n\nIn a previous report,136 CuOx thin films were deposited using a thermal ALD process at 100 °C. The TFT devices were fabricated using as-deposited Cu2O and thermally annealed CuOx and the transfer curves of the TFTs are shown in Fig. 10. The device annealed at 300 °C showed the highest field effect mobility of about 5.64 cm2/V s with a high on-off ratio (∼105), whereas CuOx annealed at a different temperature exhibited low mobility. This might be explained by competition between the Cu2O phase and CuO\nphase. Depending on the annealing temperature, the ratio of Cu2O and CuO could be changed, thus changing the charge transfer characteristics owing to their different electrical properties. As a result, Cu2O is a promising candidate for p-type oxide active layers, which can also be deposited even at low temperatures, which means that it could be applied to flexible devices.\n\n## B. Tin Monoxide\n\nThe other candidate p-type oxide material is tin monoxide. Tin oxide has two well-known stoichiometric forms: tin dioxide (SnO2) and tin monoxide (SnO). Tin dioxide is an n-type material with a high Hall mobility and high carrier concentration,137 while on the other hand, SnO is a p-type material with a layered structure,131 as shown in Fig. 11(a).\n\nThe p-type nature of SnO comes from its low formation energy, VSn, and dispersed VBM electronic structure with hybridized Sn 5s and O 2p orbitals [Fig. 11(b)].131 Kim's group143 reported a TFT application using SnO as an active layer, deposited at 210 °C. Also, two different processes were employed to condition the TFTs: (1) thermal annealing at 250 °C under an Ar atmosphere for 1 h and (2)\npassivation of the SnO surface with ALD grown Al2O3.\n\nFigures 12(a)–12(c) show the transfer characteristics of the as-grown, annealed, and Al2O3-passivated SnO TFTs with active-layer thicknesses ranging from 6.4 to 14 nm. All of the TFTs are p-type TFTs, and the current value decreased with decreasing channel thickness. The post-annealing at 250 °C under an Ar atmosphere was beneficial in effectively suppressing Ioff, as can be observed in Fig. 12(b). The passivated TFT's Ioff also decreased, owing to the decrease in excess oxygen content near the SnO surface. From these results, SnO could easily change to SnO2, so surface passivation or finding a way to prevent oxidation is important.\n\nSnO has only recently been studied as a p-type material, which can be deposited using an ALD process; therefore, further investigation and optimization are required for its application as a high-performance p-type material.\n\n## Iv. Summary And Conclusions\n\nIn this review, recent progress in oxide TFTs has been discussed with a focus on n-type and p-type active layers grown by ALD, anticipating the development of device performance. An n-type active layer can be improved by oxide semiconductor combinations from binary (ZnO) to ternary (IGZO, ITZO) compounds, since the ALD method allows for easy control over the atomic composition of nanostructured layers that can result in decreased bulk active defect states and improved device mobility as well as increased carrier concentration. However, the mechanisms of ALD growth for multicomponent oxides are often more complex than a simple sum of the growth metrics for constituent binary oxides.22,145,146 Therefore, current lack of understanding regarding multicomponent ALD growth for oxide semiconductor materials is limiting their applicability as the active layer of TFTs. In terms of p-type oxide semiconductor material, till now, there have been only a few reports investigating p-type oxide materials via ALD, and their electrical properties are inadequate for TFT device applications. However, since previous results have shown in ALD p-type TFT with great potential, further study should be conducted focusing on material and precursor optimization as well as device fabrication process development to show a grander prospect.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThis research was supported by the MOTIE (Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy) (Project Nos. 10051403, 10052020, and 10052027) and the KDRC (Korea Display Research Corporation).

First, an overview is provided on how electrical performance may be enhanced by the adoption of specific device structures and process schemes, the combination of various oxide semiconductor materials, and the appropriate selection of gate dielectrics and electrode metals in contact with the semiconductor. As metal oxide TFT devices are excellent candidates for switching or driving transistors in next generation active matrix liquid crystal displays (AMLCD) or active matrix organic light emitting diode (AMOLED) displays, the major parameters of interest in the electrical characteristics involve the field effect mobility (μFE), threshold voltage (Vth), and subthreshold swing (SS). A\nstudy of the stability of amorphous oxide TFT devices is presented next. Switching or driving transistors in AMLCD or AMOLED displays inevitably involves voltage bias or constant current stress upon prolonged operation, and in this regard many research groups have examined and proposed device degradation mechanisms under various stress conditions. The most recent studies involve stress experiments in the presence of visible light irradiating the semiconductor, and different degradation mechanisms have been proposed with respect to photon radiation. The last part of this review consists of a description of methods other than conventional vacuum deposition techniques regarding the formation of oxide semiconductor films, along with some potential application fields including flexible displays and information storage.\n\n© 2011 Elsevier B.V.

All rights reserved.\n\ndoi:10.1016/j.tsf.2011.07.018 amorphous oxide semiconductor (AOS) TFT device research, especially for next generation flat panel display (FPD) applications.\n\nCompared to amorphous silicon (a-Si), TFT devices that act as switching transistors in active matrix liquid crystal displays\n(AMLCD), which typically exhibit field effect mobility values lower than 1 cm2/Vs [2–4], much higher electrical performance can be achieved using n-type oxide semiconductors, with practical field effect mobility values exceeding 5 cm2/Vs.\n\nThe major advantage of oxide semiconductor materials is that they can be deposited using conventional semiconductor process methods such as sputtering at room temperature, and their amorphous structure enables the realization of uniform device properties over large areas. Because of such remarkable characteristics, oxide semiconductor TFTs are excellent candidate switching elements for large area (N70 in.), ultra definition (UD, 4000× 2000), and fast frame rate (N240 Hz) AMLCD panels. By properly implementing IGZO TFT arrays, Samsung Electronics successfully developed a 70-inch 240 Hz 3D UD TV prototype that was presented at FPD International 2010 in November [5].\n\nIn addition to AMLCDs, oxide semiconductor TFTs are also promising alternatives to low temperature poly-silicon (LTPS) TFTs that are used as driving elements in active matrix organic lightemitting diode (AMOLED) displays. Despite the high electrical performance of LTPS TFTs that exhibit typical field effect mobility values close to 100 cm2/Vs, the non-uniform spatial distribution of poly-Si grain structure in LTPS films results in non-uniform device properties over large areas, which is the reason why current AMOLED displays are limited to relatively small size applications such as mobile cell phones. Accordingly, several companies have demonstrated working prototype AMOLED panels driven by AOS TFTs [6–8].\n\nAmorphous oxide semiconductor devices have thus been drawing worldwide attention during the past few years, and display companies are now very close to achieving mass production of commercial products that integrate AOS TFT backplanes. In that regard, the present article aims at providing a review on the recent development of AOS TFT devices and the major issues that need to be addressed in order to succeed in the transition from basic research to product generation. The first section consists of an overview on the enhancement of device performance. The electrical characteristics of TFT devices are represented by the field effect mobility (μFE),\nthreshold voltage (Vth), and subthreshold swing (S). Such parameters strongly depend on the device structure and fabrication process, the AOS materials, and the gate dielectrics or interconnect metals in contact with the semiconductor. Because fast switching is the key role of TFT devices in electronic applications, one would in general target high μFE values, Vth close to zero, and SS values as small as possible.\n\nThe next section discusses reliability issues concerning AOS TFT\ndevices. As the pixel TFTs in AMLCD or AMOLED panels in operation constantly undergo either gate bias stress or constant current stress, it is important to understand the behavior of the devices under such stress conditions. The associated device degradation usually occurs in the form of Vth shifts, which are occasionally accompanied by severe losses in field effect mobility. In order to promote reasonable product lifetime in display panels, it is thus imperative to minimize the susceptibility of AOS TFTs with respect to voltage or current stress.\n\nThe last section presents methods other than conventional vacuum deposition techniques for the formation of AOS thin films.\n\nSolution-based processes are reviewed, and some potential applications where the integration of AOS TFTs may be effective are discussed, including flexible electronics and information storage.\n\n## 2. Optimization Of Aos Tft Device Performance\n\nThe electrical characteristics which determine device performance are evaluated in terms of several parameters such as field effect mobility (μFE), threshold voltage (Vth), and subthreshold swing (S).\n\nThese parameters are in general extracted in compliance with the gradual channel approximation. By measuring the drain current (IDS) with respect to gate voltage (VG), the mobility can be obtained from Eq. (1),\n\n$$I_{\\mathrm{DS}}={\\frac{W}{L}}\\mu C_{i}\\left[(V_{C}-V_{t h})V_{D S}-{\\frac{V_{D S}^{2}}{2}},\\right.$$\n$$(1)$$\n\nwhere μ denotes the mobility in the channel, Vth the threshold voltage, and VG the applied gate voltage. VDS is the source-drain voltage, and Ci is the capacitance of the gate insulator per unit area.\n\nThe saturation mobility (μsat) is obtained from IDS in the saturation regime under the condition VDS≫(VG–Vth) using the following equation:\n\nI\n2\nDS =ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n$${\\sqrt{\\frac{W}{2L}\\mu C_{i}}}(V_{C}-V_{t h}).$$\n$$(2)$$\nrVG−Vth ð Þ: ð2Þ\nIn the small VG regime (linear region), the mobility is defined as the linear field-effect mobility. Generally, IDS–VG curves are nonlinear, so the maximum value of μFE is often reported. The apparent fieldeffect mobility induced by the transconductance gm at a low drain voltage is determined by\n\nμFE = Lgm\n$${\\frac{L_{\\mathrm{{gsm}}}^{\\mathrm{{m}}}}{r_{\\mathrm{{C}}_{i}}V_{D S}}}\\,.$$\n$\\left(3\\right)$. \n: ð3Þ\nAnother important TFT parameter is the subthreshold swing (S),\nwhich reflects the amount of VG change required to increase IDS by an order of magnitude in the subthreshold region. From the transfer characteristics, S can be extracted using the equation:\n\n$$1\\ {\\frac{d V_{S}}{d(\\ {\\log}_{10}I_{D S})}}.$$\n$$(4)$$\nS = dVS\nd log10 IDS ð Þ: ð4Þ\nThe S value also provides important information about the quality of a TFT. It is related to the total trap density Nt near the semiconductor/gate dielectric interface by:\n\n$$N_{\\rm t}=\\left[\\frac{S\\log(e)}{kT/q}-1\\right]\\frac{C_{i}}{q}.\\tag{5}$$  Here, k is the Boltzmann constant and q is the charge of an \nelectron.\n\n## 2.1. Device Structure\n\nFig. 1 illustrates typical device structures that are adopted in the fabrication of amorphous oxide semiconductor TFTs. The TFT\nstructure can be specified by the stacking order of the gate, oxide semiconductor, and source/drain electrodes. They can be classified more precisely into combinations of top/bottom gate and top/bottom contact. The top-gate structure was employed to fabricate devices with epitaxial semiconductor layers, for which it is difficult to form bottom electrodes [9]. This structure has another advantage in that the upper gate insulator and electrodes may act as a passivation, which protects the channel layer from external damage. The top gate structure was studied in the early stage of oxide semiconductor research owing to simple fabrication methods that involve as few as two patterning mask steps [1,10]. Top gate structures were then studied to enhance the device performance by reducing the parasitic capacitance [11] and the photosensitivity with respect to light emanating from the upper OLED [12].\n\nMeanwhile, inverted staggered structures, which are the structures generally adopted in the fabrication of conventional a-Si:H\nTFTs, have been employed in most prototype displays. However, this\n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)\n\nFig. 1. Typical device structures used to fabricate amorphous oxide semiconductor TFTs.\n\nstructure has several disadvantages. For example, (i) the back channel surface is exposed to the atmosphere, and therefore the TFT\ncharacteristics can be affected by atmospheric gasses and (ii) the back channel surfaces can suffer damage from subsequent source/drain patterning or back channel etch processes. To overcome these problems, either an etch stopper or an appropriate passivation may be applied to the TFTs, and these in turn can be classified into etch stopper (ES) type and back channel etch (BCE) type devices. These structures employ bottom-gate and top-contact configurations. Both structures have been employed for the mass production of a-Si:H TFTs and are also widely used for AOS TFTs. Early AMOLED display panels involving IGZO TFTs employed the inverted staggered structure, especially the BCE structure. [13] Such devices can be strongly affected by the atmosphere due to the exposure of the back channel layer. This disadvantage induces motivation for the development of suitable passivation layers. Previously, Jeong et al. showed that passivated BCE\nAl–Zn–Sn–O TFTs had much better stability characteristics than devices without a protective layer. [14] However, permanent degradation in TFT characteristics occurring from damage during the back channel etch process cannot be avoided. To overcome this disadvantage, it is necessary to protect the back channel area during top source-drain formation.\n\nThe ES (etch-stopper) structure involves a protective layer on top of the active layer prior to forming the source and drain electrodes\n[15]. The etch-stopper structure is free from back channel damage, however it requires an extra patterning mask. The ES structure shows characteristics superior to the BCE structure, especially under bias stress [13]. Also, Park et al. showed that better TFTs characteristics can be obtained by applying a double etch-stopper structure using a consecutive stack of 150 °C and 350 °C PE-CVD SiO2 films [16]. Since the etch stopper layer does not completely isolate the underlying semiconductor from external contamination such as moisture diffusion, the application of a passivation top layer is as important in the ES structure as in the BCE structure. Park et al. showed that the use of SiNx passivation may result in high mobility, however an SiO2 passivation is more advantageous regarding device degradation, as hydrogen diffusion from the SiNx passivation layer down to the active layer results in more severe device degradation upon bias stress [17].\n\nThere is another structure called co-planar in which the source/\ndrain contacts are formed in the same plane as the channel layer (for example, bottom gate and bottom contact). This structure has some advantages such as low contact resistance with source/drain contacts, and its use has also recently been proposed for a-IGZO TFTs [18,19].\n\nIn addition to these conventional structures, double gate TFTs have been studied to improve the electrical characteristics. In such structures, an additional gate can effectively control a larger portion in the vertical direction of the semiconductor bulk. Previously, Lim et al. obtained field effect mobility values about twice as high as single gate TFTs, and subthreshold swing values lower by approximately half that of a single gate structure [20]. Also, double gate TFTs are reported to exhibit excellent device stability [21].\n\n## 2.2. Active Layer\n\nIn the active matrix liquid crystal display (AMLCD) industry, the use of high-performance transistors with high field-effect mobility above 5 cm2/Vs is necessary [22] in order to achieve high-resolution such as ultra-definition (4000× 2000), large size (N70 in.), and high frame rate operation (N240 Hz). In this regard, ZnO-based TFTs have been intensively studied as promising alternatives to conventional aSi TFTs. The applications of polycrystalline ZnO (poly-ZnO) to TFTs have been studied because the use of poly-ZnO is known to result in reasonable switching capability even when fabricated at low temperatures below 300 °C. The first report on TFTs using single crystal ZnO was published in 1968 [23]. After a long incubation period, ZnO TFT research was revisited with many papers appearing after 2003 [24–26]. Then, Elvira et al. developed fully transparent ZnO TFTs, with a room temperature process, exhibiting high mobility near 20 cm2/Vs [27]. However, such devices required relatively high gate voltages to turn-on, as they operated well into the enhancement mode. Lim et al. were able to control Vth by nitrogen (N) doping during the deposition of ZnO [28,29]. They used NH4OH injection for N\ndoping during atomic layer deposition and the N doping was shown to enhance device mobility as well as stability.\n\nZnO TFTs in former studies exhibited field effect mobility values ranging from 0.2 to 40 cm2/Vs by the optimization of the semiconductor microstructure, post annealing, and selection of gate insulator\n[30]. However, it is recognized that the formation of amorphous or single crystalline ZnO thin films is very difficult, and in general a polycrystalline structure is obtained, which leads to the formation of grain boundary defects. The existence of grain boundaries induces non-uniform TFT performance at different locations across a single flat panel display. Another problem is the difficulty of fabrication, which originates from the low chemical durability of pure ZnO against acidic etchants. Because of such problems, intensive research has been carried out on the development of amorphous metal oxide semiconductors with comparable or better device properties than those of ZnO TFTs.\n\nIn 2004, Nomura et al. used a new class of amorphous oxide semiconductors based on IGZO deposited at room temperature, and demonstrated high-performance transistors (μ≈8.3 cm2/Vs). [1]\nDespite the amorphous state, the origin of the high mobility was attributed to the electronic orbital structure of the material. As shown in Fig. 2, direct overlap between neighboring metal s orbitals can occur, and form a conducting path for free electrons which is not significantly affected even in a distorted amorphous structure. The conduction band in IGZO is mainly formed by the overlap of the In 5s orbitals, which exhibit isotropic properties. From Fig. 2, the spherical symmetry of the 5s orbitals renders the IGZO material insensitive to structural deformation, and the semiconductor maintains high mobility in the amorphous state. In comparison with Si that undergoes significant reduction in mobility from 1000 (single crystal)\nto 1 (amorphous) cm2/Vs, a-IGZO is thus a very promising material for switching or driving elements in future display products. Another important design concept of IGZO is that the incorporated Ga ions act as a carrier suppressor and network stabilizer in the conductive IZO\nhost [31]. This report drew significant attention worldwide, both from industry and academia, because of its potential in achieving high mobility, excellent spatial uniformity of the device parameters, and good scalability to large substrate sizes.\n\nFor the enhancement of device performance, optimization of the cation composition in IGZO TFTs has been actively studied. With increasing Ga content, the optical gap energy of IGZO films increases, and the turn-on voltage of the TFT shifts to positive values [32]. As the\n\n![3_image_0.png](3_image_0.png)\n\npotential barrier height increases at high Ga contents, the injection of carriers from the metal electrode to the IGZO becomes more difficult.\n\nIwasaki et al. developed optimum performance IGZO TFTs by combinatorial studies of In, Ga, and Zn compositions [33]. The corresponding devices exhibited high mobility and low Ion/Ioff ratios at high In concentrations. Also, composition variations and their effects on TFT\ncharacteristics were studied with respect to sputtering power [34].\n\nAlternative oxide semiconductor compounds have also been the subject of research. In four-component systems, Zn–In–Sn–O showed high field effect mobility (N10 cm2/Vs) [35,36]. However, In is a rare and expensive element, so it is not a material of preference for mass production in terms of cost-effectiveness. In this regard, Sn-doped ZnO TFTs have proven to be suitable as a replacement for In.\n\nPreviously, field effect mobility values of 10–15 cm2/Vs were obtained for Zn–Sn–O TFTs [37,38], and Al-doped SnO TFTs were fabricated as well [39]. Also, Ga–Zn–Sn–O devices were studied as four-component In-free oxide TFTs [40,41]. By using Zn as an alternative carrier suppressor, Zr–In–Zn–O TFTs showed comparable mobility and stability to IGZO TFTs under electrical stress; however, they exhibit a polycrystalline phase [42]. In comparison with Zr–In–Zn–O, an amorphous phase was obtained by using Hf–In–Zn–O (HIZO) [43].\n\nFig. 3 shows a cross-section of a polycrystalline IZO film (Fig. 3 (a),\nand (b)) and an amorphous thin film that results from Hf addition\n(Fig. 3 (c), and (d)). The Zr or Hf replacing Ga in the IGZO matrix was shown to act as a strong oxygen binder and carrier suppressor, leading to an improvement in the bias stability of the resulting TFTs.\n\nThe oxygen concentration is one of the key parameters that influences TFT characteristics, as oxygen vacancies are the major source of free carriers. By optimizing oxygen content, very high mobility (46 cm2/Vs), high performance (subthreshold swing=\n0.54 V/decade, Vth≈0 V), devices can be obtained [44]. In addition, undesired subthreshold photocurrent in the presence of visible light can be significantly reduced by properly optimizing the sputtering power and O2/Ar gas flow ratio during deposition [45]. Because the TFTs are exposed to visible light from the underlying backlight unit in a working AMLCD or AMOLED panel, the susceptibility of oxide TFTs with respect to illumination should be minimized. After device fabrication, annealing in an oxygen ambient can affect the oxygen concentration within the active layer. Especially, wet O2 annealing is more effective in reducing the density of electron traps, which helps to enhance TFT performance [46].\n\nFor the enhancement of field effect mobility and stability with respect to photon radiation, double active layer structures have been studied as well. By using an ITO/IGZO double active stack, excellent TFT properties with a high mobility of 104 cm2/Vs, suitable Vth of 0.5 V, and a subthreshold swing of 0.25 V/decade were demonstrated [47]. The control of a thin layer in the back channel region by using a high resistivity top layer resulted in the enhancement of the subthreshold properties. For instance, a Cu-doped IGZO back channel exhibited high on/off ratio and reduced subthreshold swing [48]. Also, Maeng et al. effectively reduced the subthreshold photocurrent by modulating the cation composition of the back channel layer [49].\n\nFig. 4 (a) and (b) shows the transfer curves of TFTs with In-rich (low resistive) and In-poor (high resistive) back channels, measured in the dark and under illumination. Relatively large amounts of photocurrent in the subthreshold region of the In-rich back channel device are observed, while in the In-poor back channel device, negligible photocurrent was obtained. This is indicative that while the front channel modulation is effective at enhancing the field effect mobility, back channel modulation controls the subthreshold properties of the device.\n\n2.3. Source/drain electrode and gate dielectric materials The effects of electrode material and gate dielectric in contact with the semiconductor are also important. Low power consumption is one of the key issues for mobile display applications, due to the limited capacity of the battery used as a power source. An effective approach to reducing power consumption is the application of high-k gate dielectrics to diminish the driving voltage range. Various high-k materials have been studied for TFT applications such as Al2O3 [28],\nY2O3 [10], BaSrTiO [50] and Ta2O5 [30]. Among the conventional high-\n\n![4_image_0.png](4_image_0.png)\n\nk materials, ZrO2 and HfLaO gate dielectrics showed high mobility\n(≈25 cm2/Vs) with comparable subthreshold swing [51,52]. The highest dielectric constant material that was employed in oxide semiconductor TFTs is BiZnNbO (k= 51) [53]. However, the mobility was not as high as expected (1.52 cm2/Vs). Such a low performance was also observed in the case of a TiO2 gate dielectric, comparable to the case with BiZnNbO. By systematic studies, it was suggested that a Coulomb scattering mechanism by phonon scattering from the large\n\n![4_image_1.png](4_image_1.png)\n\npolarization of a high-k gate dielectric can limit the channel mobility [54]. Also, for the application of the high-k gate dielectric, further investigation on high leakage currents, low band gap, interfacial reaction, and interface traps have to be performed.\n\nTo enhance the characteristics of oxide TFTs such as field effect mobility and Vth, control of the contact resistance between the source/drain and semiconductor is also a key issue. In CMOS Si technologies, doping by ion implantation or diffusion, which require high temperature annealing, are performed to lower the contact resistance. However, in the display industry, such high temperature treatments are practically impossible to carry out, due to the warping of large size glass or plastic substrates for flexible displays. Thus, plasma treatment or post process doping are generally used to lower the contact resistance. For example, field effect mobility was observed to increase by approximately three times by performing Ar plasma treatment on the active layer [55]. With Ar plasma treatment, the contact resistance of the IGZO TFT was reduced from 1550 to 330 Ω\ncm and the carrier concentration of IGZO films dramatically increased from 1014 cm−3 to 1020 cm−3.AH2 plasma treatment shows better mobility and lower contact resistance than Ar plasma treatment, since hydrogen can act as a shallow donor in the oxide semiconductor [18]. Hydrogen doping effects leading to the formation of Ohmic junctions were also observed in the case of hydrogen diffusion during SiN:H chemical vapor deposition (CVD) for the deposition of a passivation layer [19]. However, the plasma treatment or dry etch processes must be carefully controlled. The damage occurring from the plasma treatment or dry etch can induce conductor-like behavior due to a contact resistance that is too low and large back channel currents that may result from the segregation of In [56–58]. In such cases, highly negative gate voltages must be applied to deplete the conductive\n\n![5_image_0.png](5_image_0.png)\n\nactive layer. To reduce such deleterious effects, a N2O anneal process for re-oxidation of the IGZO surface can be effective [56,57]. Thus, reducing the conductivity of the active layer by treatments such as reoxidation, especially at the source/drain contact regions, may help to decrease the turn-on voltage to values near 0 V. A similar effect was observed by using a Ti/Cu bilayer electrode instead of Mo, with a single SiNx film employed as the passivation. Fig. 5 shows crosssectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of HIZO/Mo and HIZO/TiCu contact regions and shows the presence of an amorphous TiOx layer at the interface between the Ti adhesion layer and the underlying HIZO. This TiOx layer can induce almost 0 V turnon voltage by the suppression of carrier injection [59].\n\n## 3. Reliability Of Aos Tft Devices 3.1. The Origin Of Device Instability\n\nRecent efforts in AOS TFT research have been concentrating on improving the long-term stability of the devices in order to successfully implement them into AMLCD and/or AMOLED displays.\n\nA highly stable device would consist of a transistor that does not exhibit significant variations in Vth (ΔVth) upon prolonged operation, and no significant degradation in field effect mobility. For example, the driving current-induced threshold voltage shift should be considered in AMOLED driving transistors (T1 in Fig. 6 (a)) [60]. It has been reported that a Vth shift of the driving transistor by 0.1 V\ninduces variations in the resulting luminance of the OLED pixels by approximately 20%, which reflects the fact that the brightness of each pixel depends strongly on the drain current [61,62]. However, for switching TFTs in AMLCD backplanes (T2 in Fig. 6 (b)) and/or AMOLEDs (T2 in Fig. 6 (a)), the voltage stress-induced ΔVth is a very critical issue that must be taken into account in pixel circuit design.\n\nPreferably, maintaining a small ΔVth comparable to that of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) TFTs as well as preserving high field-effect mobility (μFE) values are necessary in order to successfully promote a reasonable lifetime for AOS TFT-based large-area highresolution AMLCD and AMOLED displays [63,64].\n\nCross et al. investigated the stability of TFTs incorporating sputtered ZnO as the channel layer under gate bias stress [65]. They found that positive gate-bias (VG) stress results in a positive shift in the transfer characteristics, while negative VG stress results in a negative shift. In Fig. 7, the effect of applying a 30 V bias on the gate contact of a ZnO TFT for a period of 104 s is shown. The TFT exhibits a positive Vth shift of approximately 30 V with unchanged subthreshold characteristics. This positive Vth shift upon application of a positive VG\nstress may be interpreted to occur by either negative charge trapping at the channel/gate insulator interface or negative charge injection into the gate dielectric bulk. The difference between these two mechanisms is that the charge injection model requires a larger detrapping energy barrier compared to the charge trapping model. It was observed that the devices spontaneously recover their initial state after a relaxation period of ~1 h without any thermal annealing, which suggests that the Vth shift may be attributed to charge trapping rather than charge injection. Similar charge trapping phenomena were also reported in oxide TFTs using amorphous a-IGZO as the channel material [66,67]. The charge trapping and subsequent redistribution of the trap charge in a deeper state can be described by the following stretched-exponential equation:\n\n$$V_0\\bigg\\{1-\\exp\\bigg[-\\bigg(\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\bigg)^\\beta\\bigg]\\bigg\\}$$\nΔVth = V0 1− exp − tτ\n β     ; ð6Þ\nwith V0=Vg−Vth,0, where t is the stress time, τ is the relaxation time\n\n![5_image_1.png](5_image_1.png)\n\nconstant, β is the stretched-exponential exponent, and Vth,0 is Vth\n\n![6_image_0.png](6_image_0.png)\n\nbefore applying the stress [68]. Fig. 8 shows the time dependence of ΔVth for IGZO TFTs under the application of a constant VGS of 15 V for 5× 104 s at room temperature [67]. The time dependence of ΔVth can be well fit by a stretched-exponential equation with a characteristic trapping time τ of 2 × 104 s and a stretched-exponential exponent β of 0.42.\n\nSuresh et al. reported that the charge injection mechanism is responsible for the positive Vth shift under positive VGS stress conditions [69]. By assuming a uniform distribution of trapping sites in the gate insulator, the total amount of injected charge can be obtained from the following equation, by integrating over time and the thickness of the gate insulator in which trapping sites are present:\n\nQ tð Þ = ∫ t\n$ \\int_0^t dt'\\int_0^x dt'$\n0 dx0Ntrϖ x\n0 \t  exp −ϖ x\n0  \f; ð7Þ\n$$x^{\\prime}]t^{\\prime}],$$\n\n![6_image_1.png](6_image_1.png)\n\nwhere Ntr is the density of traps in the gate insulator and ϖ(x)=\n\n![6_image_2.png](6_image_2.png)\n\nϖ0exp(−x/λ) is the time-independent tunneling probability. The tunneling constant λ is the product of the applied gate voltage and dielectric material parameters. By solving Eq. (2), charge injection via tunneling results in the following logarithmic dependence of the Vth shift:\n\n$$\\Delta V_{t h}=r_{0}\\,\\log\\Bigl({\\frac{t}{\\tau_{0}}}\\Bigr),$$\n$$({\\mathfrak{s}})$$\n ; ð8Þ\nwhere r0 is the decay rate constant, which is proportional to the product of Ntr and λ. Fig. 9 shows that the Vth change is linearly proportional to the logarithmic stress time, hence the degradation of IGZO TFTs may be attributed to charge injection involving tunneling of the channel carriers.\n\nHowever, because the TFTs are exposed to visible light originating from the underlying backlight unit in a working AMLCD panel or selfemitting radiation in AMOLED products, the susceptibility of oxide TFTs with respect to illumination should also be minimized in order to implement them into operating displays. A typical undesired phenomenon that occurs upon light exposure is non-zero subthreshold currents in the normally \"off\" region of the transfer curve, which is well known to be induced by excess photo-generated carriers within the semiconductor layer [21,70]. Under such adverse conditions, the pixels do not turn off when they should, and hence blurred images will be shown on the display. In addition, the switching TFTs in working AMLCD pixels are most of time experiencing a negative gate bias, maintaining the \"OFF\" state of the n-type transistor, which in general lasts more than 1000 times longer than the \"ON\" state [71]. Therefore, the device stability under negative bias illumination stress\n(NBIS) should be guaranteed in order to realize large-size and highresolution AMLCD and AMOLED displays incorporating AOS switching TFTs.\n\nShin et al. reported for the first time the bias stability characteristics of ZnO TFTs under visible light illumination [72]. The transfer curves exhibited almost no change under positive VG stress with illumination, while large negative shifts in Vth were observed under negative VG stress. The most plausible degradation mechanism of the ZnO TFTs under NBIS conditions was suspected to consist of photogenerated holes being trapped at the gate insulator and/or insulator/\nchannel interface. Lee et al. examined the impact of moisture on the photon-enhanced negative bias instability in IGZO TFTs [71]. It was observed that the negative Vth shift was accelerated by increasing the relative humidity under negative bias illumination stress conditions (see Fig. 10). Based on a hole trapping model, water related molecules\n\n![7_image_0.png](7_image_0.png)\n\nwere suggested to act as electron traps, resulting in the enhancement of electron–hole pair generation by photon excitation. Thus, the increase in hole carrier concentration trapped near the gate insulator/channel interface was suggested to be responsible for the acceleration of the negative V th shift.\n\nAn alternative instability mechanism under negative bias illumination has recently been proposed by Ghaffarzadeh et al. [73,74]. Passivated HIZO TFTs were observed to undergo negative Vth shifts uder NBIS conditions due to persistent photoconductivity, which leads to a long recovery time of the negatively shifted Vth. The origin of the persistent photoconductivity was attributed to the ionization of oxygen vacancy (Vo) sites, based on temperature and wavelengthdependent photoluminescence (PL) emission from the HIZO semiconductor. It was then suggested that photo-generated hole carriers may be physically localized at V O sites, of which the energy level is at approximately~2.3 eV above the valence band maximum of HIZO\n(see Fig. 11). As a result, the Vo sites become singly (V t ) or doubly\n\n![7_image_1.png](7_image_1.png)\n\nionized (V 2 + ) under illumination, and these in turn contribute free electrons which are responsible for the persistent photoconductivity. Therefore, it may be anticipated that light-induced instability of AOS TFTs can be improved by decreasing the concentration of V O sites within the channel and at interfaces.\n\nOh et al. also investigated possible origins of device degradation upon NBIS in a-IGZO TFTs [75,76]. Parallel shifts in the transfer curves were observed without significant changes in µ re and SS values, however substantial changes in capacitance-voltage characteristics suggested that the creation of subgap defect states in the channel layer dominate at sufficiently large gate bias voltages. Such defect levels were again suggested to occur from ionized oxygen vacancy sites ( V ổ + ) formed by the combination of visible light and negative gate bias. The V ô + states act as deep hole traps and provide free electron carriers in the IGZO TFT, which in turn result in negative shifts in Vth-\n\n## 3.2. Optimization Of Device Structure And Process\n\nIn order to improve the negative bias illumination stability of AOS\nTFTs, efforts have been made including adopting stable TFT structures [ 77 , 13 ], suitable gate insulator materials [ 78 , 79 ], impermeable passivation layers [ 17 , 80 ], robust semiconductors [45 , 81 ], and post annealing treatments [ 82 ]. Kwon et al. reported on the effect of device structure, by comparing bottom-gate TFTs with a backchannel-etch (BCE) structure or an etch-stopper (ES) configuration [ 13 ]. The stability of the BCE-type device was shown to be inferior to that of the ES-type device, which may be attributed to the formation of defective interfacial layers, containing, for example, MoO x Cl x complexes that remain after etching the Mo source/drain electrode on top of the IGZO\nlayer in the BCE type device. Kwon et al. also examined the effect of gate dielectric materials on the light-induced bias instability of HIZO TFTs [79] . They observed that the HfO x and SiN x dielectrics lead to poor device stability, while the stability is significantly improved by adopting SiO x as the gate dielectric. The superior stability of the SiO x gated devices was attributed to the suppression of hole injection or trapping in the gate dielectric, owing to a relatively large valence band offset with respect to the semiconductor, and lower hole trap density.\n\nPark et al. reported the influence of SiO x and SiN x passivations on the negative bias stability of HIZO TFTs under illumination [ 17 ]. The SiN x passivated devices exhibited higher µ FE , but more severe degradation under NBIS conditions. It was suggested that the incorporation of hydrogen during the SiN x deposition generates donor-like levels in the HIZO bulk and defects in the vincinity of the HIZO/gate insulator interface which act as hole trap centers. Kim et al. investigated the influence of sputtering deposition conditions of the HIZO channel layer on the negative bias illumination stability of HIZO\nTFTs [45]. Highly stable devices were fabricated by optimizing the deposition conditions (i.e., high sputtering power and high O2/Ar gas flow ratio), which may lead to fewer subgap defects states related to oxygen vacancies in the HIZO layer. Ji et al. studied the effect of highpressure oxygen annealing on negative bias illumination-induced instability of IGZO TFTs [82]. They found that the Vth shift can be significantly suppressed by high-pressure annealing under a 10 atm O2 ambient. The improved photo-stability was suggested to be associated with a decreased VO concentration in the annealed IGZO\nbased on x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results. This work also supports the instability mechanism involving the transition of VO to VO\n2+ by capturing photo-induced hole carriers under light illumination. Recently, theoretical first principles calculations have been performed to investigate the origin of the light-induced negative bias instability [83]. Ryu et al. suggested that oxygen vacancies (VO) act as hole traps and play an important role in the photo-excited Vth instability of oxide TFTs under negative bias stress. This is consistent with the hole trapping model proposed above, in that a net accumulation of positive charge at the channel/dielectric interface is the major cause of device degradation under negative bias illumination stress [83].\n\n## 4. Present And Future Issues In Oxide Semiconductor Applications\n\nAs described in previous sections, the major issues concerning oxide semiconductor TFT devices involve the improvement in electrical performance (such as achieving high mobility) and stability upon bias stress [84,85]. Since amorphous oxide semiconductors are very attractive in realizing large area displays (LCD and OLED), the deposition methods have been confined to the use of conventional semiconductor process equipment, compatible with amorphous silicon (a-Si) and/or low temperature poly-silicon (LTPS) technology\n[86–88]. However, alternative forms of electronic modules such as flexible and printable display, novel memory devices, and circuits are quickly emerging nowadays and it is anticipated that by implementing oxide semiconductors into these applications a new electronic paradigm will dominate the market in the near future [89–93]. In this regard, the current section focuses on two issues to provide an overview of the current trends in oxide semiconductor research: solutionprocessed metal oxide TFTs and novel electronic applications.\n\n## 4.1. Solution-Processed Metal Oxide Thin Film Transistors\n\nSolution process methods are attractive methods of fabricating TFTs in order to achieve low-cost production and cover large-areas.\n\nHere, the oxide semiconductor is in general formed either by coating or printing an aqueous solution, and subsequent annealing in air or in an inert atmosphere. Conventional methods used in the fabrication of oxide semiconductor devices are generally based on multiple photolithographic steps and vacuum-deposition processes. However, solution-processes may offer an innovative cost-down scheme while increasing the substrate size, reducing the number of mask steps, and eventually improving the production yield [90,94].\n\nFig. 12 (a) and (b) shows a simple chart that classifies the types of solution-processes and a schematic illustration of an oxide formation mechanism, respectively. As depicted in Fig. 12 (a), depending on the active material, coating, and solution type, solution-processed oxide semiconductors can be fabricated by various methods. The active materials are divided into organic, inorganic, and hybrid semiconductors. Although the solution process has been intensively explored in the field of organic (small molecule and polymer) semiconductors\n[95,96] and organic–inorganic hybrid materials [97], inorganic semiconductors are recently attracting much interest because of their high electrical performance (high mobility and on/off current ratio\n(Ion/off)). There are three types of materials in inorganic semiconb)\n\n![8_image_0.png](8_image_0.png)\n\n![8_image_1.png](8_image_1.png)\n\n![8_image_2.png](8_image_2.png)\n\nductors for solution process, including silicon, chalcogenides, and oxide semiconductors. The coating method for a solution process may be selected among spin-coating, printing (ink-jet, micro-contact, etc.),\nand chemical bath deposition (CBD). The solution for coating films can be prepared with soluble precursors or nanoparticles dispersed in a solvent. As shown in Fig. 12 (b), the metal oxide solution can result in uniform and continuous thin films on substrates after spin-coating and/or ink-jet printing. Aprotic solvents are highly volatile and do not dissociate the metal ligand precursor. The liquid thin film formed by the precursor readily loses the solvent and forms a uniform film, which then absorbs moisture from the ambient air. Finally, a solid metal oxide thin film is formed by a substitution reaction between water and metal ligands.\n\nSolution-processed oxide TFTs were initially fabricated with a CBD\nZnO film using Zn-acetate [Zn(CH3COO)2–2H2O, ZnAcc] dissolved in 2-methyoxyethanol [98], or spin-coated ZnO using Zn-nitrate [Zn\n(NO3)2–6H2O] in DI water [99].

In terms of\n\n![10_image_2.png](10_image_2.png)\n\nmobility, Ong et al. [100] were able to further increase the mobility of spin-coated ZnO-TFTs by controlled annealing at 500 °C to enhance the (002) preferred orientation of ZnO. Then, the mobility of the TFT\nincreased to a value as high as 5.25 cm2/V.s.\n\nThe process temperature is also an important factor that is critical in determining whether solution-processing is advantageous compared to other semiconductor and/or conventional vacuum processes.\n\nCheng et al. [101] grew a ZnO film using CBD with subsequent annealing at 100 °C. They obtained a mobility of 0.25 cm2/V.s with a bottom gate TFT. Lia et al. [102] reported low temperature growth of ZnO at 60 °C for flexible electronics, resulting in a mobility of 0.56 cm2/V.s. In addition, ZnO TFTs, fabricated with ZnO nanorods, also exhibit potential at low temperatures, below 230 °C, and even down to room temperature [103,104].\n\nMulti-component oxide TFTs have also been intensively investigated to achieve an amorphous structure, high mobility (over 10 cm2/V.s), and low process temperatures (below 250 °C) since amorphous In–Ga–Zn–O (a-IGZO), grown by conventional vacuum processes, exhibit excellent physical and chemical properties and electrical performance. Results of solution processed oxide TFTs are summarized in Table 1. Lee et al. [93] explored a general route to realize printable high-mobility-oxide semiconductors at 600 °C, using ZnCl2, InCl2, and SnCl2 precursors dissolved in acetonitrile. The mobility values of bottom-gated TFTs with In–Zn–O (spin-coating)\nand In–Zn–Sn–O (ink-jet printing) were 16 and 7.4 cm2/V.s, respectively. Subsequently, many multi-component oxide TFTs fabricated by spin coating and ink-jet printing methods have been reported. Although many researchers have studied different precursors, oxide materials, and device structures, the performance of the resulting TFTs were not sufficient, and mobility values were far too low, to compete with conventional vacuum processes.\n\nVery recently, K. K Banger et al. [115] reported the formation of amorphous metal oxide semiconducting thin films (IZO and IGZO)\nusing a 'sol–gel on chip' hydrolysis approach from soluble metal alkoxide precursors, which resulted in an unprecedented high mobility of 10 cm2/V.s, reproducible and stable turn-on voltages Von ~ 0 V, and high operational stability at maximum process temperatures as low as 230 °C. Representative transfer curves of hydrolysed and dry-annealed IZO TFTs are shown in Fig. 13 (a)–(h). At lower temperatures, non-hydrolysed IZO samples such as in Fig. 13 (g)\nexhibit very poor TFT performance with low mobility N0.1 cm2/V.s and large hysteresis (35 V), indicative of significant charge trapping at\n\n![11_image_0.png](11_image_0.png)\n\nthe semiconductor/dielectric interface. In contrast, devices fabricated using the hydrolysed process (Fig. 13 (a)–(f)) exhibit high mobility, small hysteresis (<1.2 V) and small subthreshold slopes (< 0.5 V/\ndecade) at annealing temperatures as low as 230 °C. Therefore, it can be expected that this process may provide new opportunities for integrating amorphous oxide materials into functional electronic and optoelectronic devices.\n\nIn terms of practical industrial applications, Samsung Electronics have intensively studied solution processes and reported the first solution-processed oxide TFT panels in the form of a 2,2-inch mono-\nQQVGA (Quarter Quarter Video Graphic, 128 × 160) AMOLED with a bottom-emission structure [116]. Fig. 14 (a) shows an optical microscope image of a pixel array in which each pixel consists of two TFTs for switching and driving and one storage capacitor (2 transistor + 1 capacitor). The maximum process temperature was elevated to 350 °C\nin order to obtain proper TFT performance. Fig. 14 (b) clearly demonstrates that solution-processed oxide TFTs can successfully operate at display gray levels. After the successful fabrication of a 2.2-inch AMOLED panel, they demonstrated a 4-inch color QVGA (Quarter Video Graphic Array, 320 × 240 pixels) AMLCD panel and a monochrome 4-inch QVGA AMOLED panel [90]. Taiwan TFT LCD Association\n(TTLA)/Inpria Corp./Oregon State University also reported a 4.1-inch QVGA AM-LCD panel [117]. Toppan succeeded in fabricating high mobility (5.4 cm²/V.s) devices at a low temperature of 270 °C from a solution supplied by Evonik Industries and also fabricated 400 ppi\n(pixel per inch) VGA e-paper [ 118 ]. The development and selection of new precursors and the improvement of the semiconductor microstructure are important issues in solution-processed metal oxide thin film transistors; the ultimate goal is to achieve a combination of lowprocess temperature and high device performance (mobility and device stability) which is already available in microcrystalline silicon technology.\n\n## 4.2. Novel Electronic Applications\n\nSince the demonstration of an amorphous IGZO thin film transistor on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates [ 1 ], significant interest was ignited in high-end AMLCD and AMOLED technology because such devices are promising for high mobility, excellent uniformity in device parameters, and good scalability to large substrate areas. Particularly, several display companies have plunged into the development of oxide TFTs for demonstrating flexible and transparent flat panel displays. Toppan Printing Inc. reported 2-inch mono-color (80 × 60 pixels) and 4-inch full-color (QVGA) e-papers driven by a-IGZO TFTs on polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) plastic substrates as shown in Fig. 4 (a) and (b), respectively [ 119 ]. Sputterdeposited SiOxN, film was utilized as the gate insulator and passivation layer for bottom-gate InGaZnO TFTs. The µ FE , V th , and lon/off ratio values are 6 cm 2 /V.s, 1.6 V and >10 4 , respectively. This suggests a flexible electronic solution for the combination of an e-ink imaging film and a-IGZO TFTs. Samsung SDI Co. presented a 4.1-inch transparent Quarter Common Intermediate Format (QCIF) (176 ×\nRGB×220 pixels; 69 ppi) AMOLED display driven by a-IGZO TFTs as shown in Fig. 15: (c) mono-color and (d) full-color. In order to\n\n![11_image_1.png](11_image_1.png)\n\nemphasize the transparency of a-IGZO TFTs, both top and bottom emitting transparent OLED structures were adopted, indicating that the semi-transparent cathode and transparent anode were used in order to emit light in both directions. The transmittance of the AMOLED panel was higher than 20%. The μfe, Vth, subthreshold gate swing (S), and Ion/off ratio values are 14.8 cm2/V.s, 5.9 V, 0.59 V/\ndecade, and 5 × 106, respectively. Additionally, Park also reported a prototype transparent 2.5 inch AMOLED on a glass substrate, driven by ALD-deposited ZnO TFTs exhibiting reasonable device performance with a μfe of 4 cm2/V.s and Ion/off= 107 [12].\n\nLG Electronics Inc. realized a prototype of a 3.5 inch QCIF+\n(176 × 220 pixels) AMOLED display driven by a-IGZO TFTs, with pixels involving two transistors plus one capacitor on a stainless steel foil (panel thickness ~ 1 mm). Amorphous IGZO TFTs with top gate configuration and top emission OLED were employed and the fabricated TFTs exhibit a μFE= 6.7 cm2/V.s, S= 0.61 V/decade, and Ion/off ratio= 3.5 × 105 [120]. Although there are many ongoing efforts to realize flexible AMOLEDs, it still involves the use of thin glass and metal foil substrates, excluding polymer substrates. Indeed, the major limitation of polymer substrates comes from their poor surface quality, oxygen and moisture permeability, low glass transition temperature (Tg), and large coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE:\nSS (Stainless Steel) 304 (~17 ppm/K), non-alkali glass (~3 ppm/K), PET (~10 ppm/K, Tg ~78 °C)). However, as shown in Fig. 16 (a), Samsung Mobile Display [89] demonstrated a reasonable solution to realize flexible AMOLED on novel polyimide (PI) substrate, having a low CTE (3.4 ppm/K) and a high glass transition temperature (Tg\n~360 °C). They fabricated a 6.5-inch flexible full-color top-emission AMOLED on a PI substrate driven by a-IGZO TFTs. The a-IGZO TFTs exhibited a μFE of 15.1 cm2/V.s, S= 0.25 V/decade, and Vth= 0.9 V.\n\nRemarkably, they proved that the key issue of mechanical deformation with TFT backplanes is the fact that inorganic films and TFTs on flexible substrates undergo mechanical stress damage upon continuous deformation. As depicted in Fig. 16 (b), TFT samples on a 10 μm thick PI substrate withstood bending down to R (radius of curvature)= 3 mm under tension and compression without performance degradation. This indicated that TFT backplanes on sufficiently thin flexible substrates can be safely bent to smaller curvatures.\n\nRecently, the electrical information storage ability of devices with wide band gap ZnO-based materials has been intensively explored in view of nonvolatile memory (NVM) applications [121–124]. A NVM device that can be embedded into next generation large-area electronic systems is a promising component for the realization of low-cost and high-functionality consumer electronics. Several types of NVM structures, such as ferroelectronic films, resistive films, or a conventional sandwich gate insulator structure of the floating gate type or charge trap type, have been introduced in various forms of TFT devices that use different methods for information storage [125–127]. Fig. 17 (a) and (b) are representative NVM results that adopt a conventional sandwich gate insulator structure and ferroelectronic film, respectively. H. Yin et al.\n\n[125] reported a fully transparent NVM structure, operated by a-IGZO TFTs while being combined with various metal-oxide materials such as Al2O3, IGZO, and Al2O3 as the electron charge's tunneling, storage, and blocking layers, respectively. Typical transfer curves of the a-IGZO\nTFT NVM in program and erase modes without post-annealing are shown in Fig. 17 (a). Clear positive and negative shifting of the transfer curves due to channel hot electron injection in the program mode and one type of band-to-band tunneling-induced hot hole injection erase mode are observed. B. H. Kim et al. [126] reported a new ferroelectric memory array, driven by a-IGZO TFTs on a glass substrate, composed of two normal a-IGZO TFTs and a ferroelectric TFT (FeTFT). Poly\n(vinylidenefluoride–trifluoroethylene) [P(VDF–TrFE)] was employed as the gate dielectric layer of the FeTFT. Fig. 17 (b) shows the transfer characteristics of the fabricated FeTFT, measured by sweeping VG from negative to positive values and then from positive to negative values\n(double-sweep mode). In fact, dynamic properties of oxide TFTs are as important as static properties for applications of TFTs in active matrix electronics.\n\nThere are many reports on dynamic circuits based on a-IGZO\nTFTs on glass substrates [89,128,129]. Interestingly, a few circuits, fabricated with a-IGZO TFTs, were also demonstrated on flexible\n\n![12_image_0.png](12_image_0.png)\n\ncircuits implemented with a-IGZO TFTs were fabricated on PI/PET\nplastic substrates. The representative transfer curves on plastic exhibit a saturation mobility of 19 cm2/V.s and an S value of ~0.14 V/decade in Fig. 18 (a). Fig. 18 (b), (c), and (d) are a schematic diagram, an optical image, and an output waveform of a fabricated ring oscillator, respectively. For an input signal of 20 V, an 11-stage ring oscillator operates at 94.8 KHz with a propagation delay time of 0.48 μs, only two times slower than the fastest oxide TFT-based ring oscillators on glass substrates.\n\n## 5. Summary\n\nTo summarize, oxide semiconductor TFTs have progressed marvelously as promising electronic devices within an extremely short time. Several companies such as Samsung Electronics, Samsung Mobile Display, and LG Display have already demonstrated many prototypes of AMLCD and AMOLED panels that integrate oxide TFT\nbackplanes; this shows that such products are not far from being part of our daily life. In addition, novel applications such as transparent and flexible electronics are being explored intensively by several research groups. The field of oxide TFT research will remain a subject of intensive studies, as their superior device properties and relatively low fabrication cost are attractive for application in high-end electronics and/or large-scale ubiquitous markets.\n\nHowever, further issues must be considered and/or solved to step forward toward mass-production. Fundamental research involves the understanding of the density of states and defect levels in ionic semiconductor compounds, which will lead to a more thorough understanding on the mechanisms that govern device stability.\n\nAnother issue concerns the development of standard process schemes for mass-production. The electrical performance and stability of the oxide TFT devices have to be reproducible, meeting very rigorous criteria. The present review has thus provided much information on how the device structure, selection of materials, and process conditions may influence the oxide semiconductor TFT device properties. Although many researchers have contributed to the improvement of electrical performance and device stability based on different structures, process methods, and materials to date, several restrictions exist with regard to mass production; thus a meticulous selection of materials and process is necessary.\n\nSolution-based processes and novel applications will also be seriously considered in future research. The achievement of a lowtemperature process and reasonable device reliability will be critical to whether this technology survives or not.\n\nDespite the above issues, oxide semiconductor TFTs are anticipated to provide solutions to overcome many obstacles and limitations of conventional Si technology, and will without doubt become the leading technology in the near future.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThe present research was conducted under the research funding of Dankook University in 2010.\n\n## References\n\n[1] K.

This review first provides a brief history **and current status of AOS technology,** and then introduces electronic defects in AOSs reported to date that are critically important for understanding and controlling the instability of TFTs that is the most serious issue in the development of the AOS\ntechnology. In particular, it is important to know that many AOS defects are related to oxygen and hydrogen impurities, though oxygen is the major constituent of AOS and hydrogen is not intentionally incorporated. Instability issues and their underlying mechanisms are also discussed in relation to these defects.\n\n## 1. Introduction: History Of Amorphous Oxide Semiconductors (Aoss) And Why They Are Employed In State-Of-The-Art Displays\n\nAOS is a rather new semiconductor material system for largearea semiconductor devices that came into prominence following hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H), hightemperature annealed polycrystalline silicon (HTPS), laserannealed low-temperature polycrystalline silicon (LTPS), and organic semiconductors. The first practical device made with AOS was reported in 2004 as a channel material of high mobility, transparent, and flexible TFT fabricated at room temperature (RT) on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates without post-deposition annealing.[1] AOS TFT was commercialized in 2012.

Finally, we discuss our understanding of TFT stability issues and propose a fabrication condition for producing good AOS TFTs in relation to the above knowledge of defects. There have been a number of review papers on the subject of AOS TFT. To minimize the references due to page limitation, kindly refer to refs. [2–6] for details and their respective references where details were not provided. Refs. [7–15] are also recommended for further understanding.\n\nRef. [16] is suitable for flexible applications and for solutions and printed electronics.\n\nAOS has a rather short history as its concept was first proposed in 1996.[17] Conversely, research into oxide TFTs dates back to the mid-1960s, starting from crystalline ZnO, In2O3, and SnO2 field-effect transistors (FETs) and TFTs.[18,19] However, after that, few reports about the topic are published in accessible literatures until 1990's probably due to their instability issues.\n\nThe next oxide TFT reappeared in 1996 as a ferroelectric memory FET that uses an epitaxial SnO2 channel.[20] Intensive research on oxide TFT was revisited due to expectations that polycrystalline ZnO (poly-ZnO) would produce practical TFTs even at low temperatures on large glass substrates with much higher fieldeffect (FE) mobilities ((μFE) >10 cm2V1 s 1) than those of a-Si:\nH TFTs (<1 cm2V1 s 1). However, the initial poly-ZnO TFTs suffered from low μFE up to 3 cm2V1 s 1, normally-on characteristics, non-uniformity, and instability issues due to high-density residual electron carriers, grain boundary (GB) issues, etc. (see ref. [2]).\n\nBefore the first AOS was proposed in 1996,[17] it was believed that amorphous semiconductors have very low mobilities <<1 cm2 V1 s 1, as seen in a-Si:H and amorphous chalcogenides. Conversely, the AOS concept proposed indicates that amorphous oxide composed of heavy metal cations (HMC) with electronic configurations (n–1)d10ns 0\n(n  4) are promising candidates for high-mobility amorphous semiconductors because the lowest unoccupied states (conduction band minimum, CBM) is composed mainly of largely spread spherical metal ns0 orbitals and is expected to have a small electron effective mass and a high electron mobility even in amorphous disordered structures. The first demonstrations of AOS were Hþ-implanted Cd2GeO4, AgSbO3, and Cd2PbO4 that showed high electron mobilities for amorphous materials 5–12 cm2 V1 s 1.\n\n[21] Thereafter, high mobility, heavily doped a-IGZO thin films were reported in\n\n## Www.Advancedsciencenews.Com Www.Pss-A.Com\n\n2000.[22,23] Then, a-IGZO was chosen as channel material for TFT because it does not contain toxic elements (such as Cd, Sb, and Pb) and does not require Hþ-implantation to increase its free electron density, Ne. By reducing Ne and defect density in a-IGZO thin films, the first AOS TFT was reported in 2004 with good operating characteristics that can even be fabricated by an RT process on flexible PET sheets.[1]\nAOSs have attracted significant attention in FPD industries and the academia. This is due to its favorable features such as high mobility, high uniformity,low processtemperature, a wideflexibility of chemical composition, good controllability of carrier density, and transparency.[4,11–13,24]Interms ofmobility,μFE>10 cm2V1 s 1 are easily obtained. In addition, higher mobilities >30 cm2V1 s 1 are available for In-rich AOSs and other AOSs such as a-In-Sn-Zn-O\n(ITZO)[25] and a-In-Al-Zn-O (IAZO) TFTs[26] (note that the constituent elements in the IAZO are not described in the paper[27]\nbut presented at the corresponding SID2014 conference). Very high μFE 100 cm2V1 s 1 have been reported for amorphous Zn-O-N\nTFTs[28,29] (note that up to 240 cm2V1 s 1 of Hall mobility was also reported[30]).\n\nFigure 1 compares the typical operating characteristics of an aIGZO TFT and an a-Si:H TFT.[4] It can be seen that the a-Si:H\nTFT provides a source-to-drain current (IDS) up to only 3 μA\neven if high gate-to-source voltage (VGS) and source-to-drain voltage (VDS) of 20 V are applied. However, it is said that a typical organic light-emitting diode (OLED) pixel requires several μA to emit light that is strong enough. In contrast, the a-IGZO TFT provides almost a hundred times higher current than the a-Si:H\nTFT does, and only 5 V of VGS and VDS are required to drive an OLED pixel. This is the most important reason why a-IGZO TFT is considered a necessary semiconductor for state-of-the-art FPDs like large-sized OLED displays.\n\nAfter the first AOS TFT reported in 2004,[1] several manufacturers have demonstrated prototype displays including transparent, flexible, and OLED displays, as summarized in previous review articles.[2,4,5] As at May 2018, only a-IGZO TFTs with nominal chemical composition of InGaZnO4 (so-called 111 composition) have been employed in commercial displays. This is probably because the 111 composition of a-IGZO is the most intensively studied and well understood, and also has a process window wide enough for large-area production of TFT backplanes.\n\nThe first commercialization was achieved by Sharp Corporation in 2012 and then extended to Sharp's mobile phones and tablets, and further extended to many other companies' note PCs, PC displays, etc. As a related material, Sharp and Semiconductor Energy Laboratory (SEL) employ partially crystalized IGZO TFTs for some small-sized high-resolution FPDs but they are not applied to large production lines generation 8.5 (G8.5) as at September 2018. A remarkable commercial a-IGZO TFT product is the large-size OLED\ntelevisions. LG commercialized FHD (resolution 1920  1080) 55 inches curved OLED TV in 2013, 4 K (3840  2160) 65 and 77 curved OLED TV in 2016 and very thin \"wallpaper OLED TV\" in 2017. They also demonstrated more sophisticated prototypes, 8 K\n(7640  4320) 88 inches OLED display and 4 K 65 inches rollable OLED TV at the 2018 International CES. Note that AOS TFT is the only available channel semiconductor for such large-sized OLEDs as at September 2018, because a-Si:H TFTcannot provide Keisuke Ide received B.S. degree\n\n![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)\n\nfrom Meiji University, Japan in 2010, M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo Technology), Japan in 2012 and 2017, respectively.

[4]).\n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)\n\nwww.advancedsciencenews.com **www.pss-a.com**\n\n![2_image_1.png](2_image_1.png)\n\n## 2. Origin Of High Mobility In Aoss: Electronic Structure\n\nAs explained in section 1, AOS TFTs exhibit several advantageous features, such as 1) reasonably high mobilities\n(>10 cm2V1 s 1) applicable for large-sized OLEDs; 2) uniformity over large glass substrates; 3) low temperature process from RT to about 400 C; 4) low operating voltages; 5) a small subthreshold voltage swing, S (the S value can be lowered to 100 mV decade1 for a-IGZO TFT that is comparable to the value for poly-Si TFT but much smaller than that for a-Si:H TFT\nwith a value of 400 mV decade1) (see Ref. [4] for details), etc.\n\nTo understand why AOSs can exhibit such high mobilities even in amorphous structures, it is important to compare with conventional covalent semiconductors like Si. Covalent crystalline semiconductors such as c-Si and GaN are used for high-performance, high-value devices such as high-speed memory/CPUs and high-efficiency light-emitting diodes\n(LEDs)/solar cells. Their amorphous materials, such as a-Si:\nH [31,32] and amorphous chalcogenides (e.g., a-Se[33] and aAs2S3\n[34]) are also used in some practical semiconductor devices such as TFTs, solar cells, photoreceptors in photocopiers, phase change (resistivity switching) memories, etc. As known from the success of p/n control in a-Si:H in 1975,[35] it is important to passivate their dangling bonds by forming Si─H bonds to reduce the number of carrier traps so as to employ amorphous silicon for practical TFTs and solar cells. For amorphous chalcogenides, they were used in other applications such as photoreceptors and phase change memories because these applications require neither high mobility nor carrier control. Even a-Si:H exhibits low carrier mobility <1 cm2 V1 s1 because commercial LCDs products and solar cells do not require high mobility but inevitably need low-temperature production on large-sized (e.g., >2  2 m2)\nglasses and plastic substrates. Conversely, ionic crystalline materials have also been intensively investigated for optoelectronic applications based on well-known transparent conductive oxides such as ZnO,[36–38] In2O3,\n[39,40] and SnO2,\n[41] but they have not been commercialized as active semiconductor materials. Though organic semiconductors and their TFTs may be produced at low temperatures and some organic semiconductors exhibit high mobilities >10 cm2 V1 s1, typical materials and TFTs exhibit low mobilities comparable to or even far lower than those of a-Si:H.\n\nAs explained in ref. [2], AOSs overcome their drawbacks because they have unique advantages owing to their ionic bonding nature. As explained above, the mobility of a-Si:H is much lower than that of the crystalline one. This is because their chemical bonds made of sp3 or p orbitals possess strong spatial directivities. Conversely, AOSs exhibit high electron mobilities because the CBMs of HMC oxides are made mainly of spherical s orbitals of metal cations, overlapping largely with neighboring metal s orbitals even in amorphous structures.[42] Other advantageous features of AOSs such as the small S values and low operating voltages are related to their low defect density as explained in refs. [4,5].\n\n## 3. Instability Issues And Effects Of Carrier Traps In Aos Tfts\n\nAs explained in section 2, the major reasons for the large μFE of AOS TFTs are due mainly to 1) high electron mobilities (i.e., Hall mobility or drift mobility) and 2) low-density defects (electron traps). FET physics shows that carrier traps in the gate insulator and gate-channel interface as well as in the channel limit the μFE\nbecause a part of the carriers induced by VGS are immobilized by these traps (e.g., see ref. [4]). This is why specific gate insulator materials should be chosen for specific semiconductor FETs to minimize the total carrier traps; for example, a-SiO2 is usually chosen for crystalline Si FETs and a-SiNx:H for a-Si:H TFTs. In contrast, AOS TFTs exhibit high performances with a wide variety of gate insulators such as SiO2, SiNx,\n[43,44] SiO2/SiNx stacking layer, and high-k materials such as ZrO2,\n[45] Y2O3,\n[46]\nAl2O3,\n[47,48] and organic insulators (though there are some reports that some organic insulators cause extra instability)\nwhose features benefit from the ionic bonding nature that hardly form electron traps.\n\nThough AOS TFTs have many advantages for FPDs and are already commercialized as explained in section 1, they still have open issues, especially the instability issues observed under several stress test modes such as positive bias stability (PBS), negative bias stability (NBS), positive bias and temperature (PBTS), constant current stability (CCS), and negative bias and light illumination (NBIS). Typically, PBS and CCS give positive threshold voltage (Vth) shifts (ΔVth), while light illumination and NBIS induce large negative ΔVth. Conversely, good AOS TFTs do not show reasonable ΔVth against NBS without light illumination. The possible origins of the instability reported to date would be separated to the parts of a TFT structure as follows: 1) gate-insulator[49,50]; 2) interface[51]; 3) surface[52–54];\n4) source/drain contacts[55]; and 5) the bulk region of the channel materials.[4] In terms of defects, in general, the increase in shallow donors in the channel and positive charge trapping at the gate-channel interface cause negative ΔVth while the increase in electron traps (acceptors) in the channel and negative charge traps at the interface cause positive ΔVth.\n\nFigure 2 shows a CCS result for a-IGZO TFTs, where positive ΔVth enhanced the stress time.[56] The creation of deep electron traps and reduction of shallow donors would be possible origins, but the former would be more plausible under such degradation test. In addition, charge trapping/detrapping models have also been proposed.[49,57,58]\n\n![3_image_0.png](3_image_0.png)\n\n![3_image_1.png](3_image_1.png)\n\nwww.advancedsciencenews.com **www.pss-a.com**\nFor the surface issues, it is known that the electrical characteristics of oxide semiconductors including AOS are sensitive to adsorption/desorption of atmosphericmolecules such as O2,H2O, and H2. Kang et al. reported that oxygen adsorbed on an a-IGZO\nsurface causes positive ΔVth as the adsorbed O trap electrons.[52]\nJeong et al. reported that absorbed H2O molecules cause negative ΔVth as electronegative O atoms are adsorbed to the a-IGZO\nsurface.[53,54]Therefore, in practical AOS TFTs, TFTis covered by a gas-tight passivation layer and protected from the adsorption/ desorption/diffusion issues. These gas sensitivities are serious issuesto be solved for TFTs, but they suggest that AOS TFTs can be used for high-sensitivity gas sensors without the need to be protected by passivation layers.[59,60]\nMore serious AOS TFT issues include light illumination instability. In particular, NBISis the most serious issue for TFTs in LCDs because TFTs are always illuminated by LCD backlight and are subjected to negative VGS during for much of their operating time. Though AOSs have large bandgaps, Eg> 3.0 eV (e.g., 3.0–\n3.2 eV for a-IGZO), they exhibit photoresponses even to lower energy subgap light down to 2.3 eV in relation to high-density deep defects in the bandgap (this will be discussed in detail in section 4). **Figure 3** shows transfer curves for unpassivated and Y2O3-passivated a-IGZO TFTs illuminated with monochromated photons fromhν ¼ 1.8–3.4 eVat a photonflux of1014 cm2 s 1. It is seen that off-current Ioff increases and Vth shifts to negative voltages withincreasinghν. Suchlight-inducedinstabilityis closely related to the so-called persistent photo-conductivity (actually not persistent but has very long relaxation time >103 s or even\n>days).[61] **Figure 4** shows that a-IGZO thin films exhibit very long decay times >103 s for transient photocurrents[61] that are often observed in wide gap semiconductors such as ZnO,[62]\nTiO2,\n[63] and GaN.[64] Such slow decay is generally considered to be associated with a relaxation process that possess a large activation energy (see refs. [65,66] e.g., for ZnO), and such phenomena are sometimes employed for optoelectronic devices such as optical sensor-integrated TFT circuits.[67] The paper above[64] proposes bistable structures with activation energies of 0.9–1.0 eV. Nahm et al. supported this idea through density functional theory (DFT) calculations, where the photoexcitation of a valence band electron induces the formation of a peroxy linkage O–O, release electrons, and causes the generation of long decay time photocurrents.[68] A similar model was also proposed for H states.[69]\nAs shown in **Figure 5**a, NBS hardly induces ΔVth in good aIGZO TFTs while large negative ΔVth is observed for NBIS, as shown in Figure 5b. One of the possible mechanisms for the observed instability is described in Ref. [70]. As explained above, a possible origin for negative ΔVth is the accumulation of positive charges at the gate-channel interface. In the case of Figure 5c, the negative ΔVth becomes smaller with increasing\n\n![4_image_0.png](4_image_0.png)\n\nwww.advancedsciencenews.com **www.pss-a.com**\n\n![4_image_1.png](4_image_1.png)\n\nchannel thicknesses for the bottom gate TFT structure with light illumination from the back channel (i.e., from the top of the TFT), suggesting that hole drift/diffusion from the back channel to the interface dominates the instability of the NBIS\nand providing estimation of the hole mobility as 0.01 cm2 V1 s 1. Ion drift/diffusion such as Hþ and ionized oxygen vacancy (e.g., VO\nþ and VO\nþþ) are also other possibilities; however, it is reported that the mobility of O and H estimated from SIMS diffusion studies are as low as 1015 and 1013 cm2 V1 s 1, respectively.[71,72] This implies that the origin of the migrating positive charges is not likely associated with the slow O/H migration, and hole migration and traps may be used to explain the instability of the NBIS in this bottom-gate a-IGZO TFT, as schematically drawn in Figure 5d.\n\n## 4. Electronic Defects In Aoss: Overview\n\nAs described in section 3, instability issues are closely related to carrier traps in gate insulators, interfaces, and channel materials. It is known that some structural defects such as vacancy, substitution, anti-site, and interstitial atoms form carrier traps if they form additional electron states in the bandgap (electronic defects). Conversely, it is often said that\n\"amorphous materials are composed only of structural defects,\"\nbut some amorphous materials have open bandgaps with few carrier traps and work as active layers in semiconductor devices. That is, the important defects for amorphous semiconductors are electronic defects not the structural defects.\n\nThus, we refer to electronic defects as \"defects\" where they are not specifically explained.\n\nFigure 6 summarizes the defects in a-IGZO reported to date\n\n![4_image_2.png](4_image_2.png)\n\nby experimental and theoretical calculations. It is reported that a-IGZO almost has no conduction band (CB) tails[73] and\n\n![5_image_2.png](5_image_2.png)\n\n![5_image_0.png](5_image_0.png)\n\n![5_image_1.png](5_image_1.png)\n\nless subgap density of states than a-Si:H 174.751 that is an important reason that AOS TFTs exhibit high mobility and operate at low voltages, as explained in section 2. Donor levels are located at ≈0.13 eV from CBM (see references in the figure), and deeper traps are found at 0.2–0.3 eV. The number of deep traps at ≈0.2 eV are reduced by annealing at ≥ 300 °C,\nand therefore, post-deposition thermal annealing improves TFT hysteresis and instability. 1751 The deep traps at ≈0.3 eV are passivated through the incorporation of hydrogen, thereby improving a-IGZO TFT performances. In contrast, annealing at ≥ 400°C depletes this hydrogen and deteriorates the performance of the TFT, as will be explained later. [76.77]\nTheoretically, undercoordinated indium is for instance, proposed as an origin of electron traps. [78]\nAn evident feature is that AOS has high-density subgap states just above the valence band maximum (VBM) (near- VBM states) at typical densities > 10 20 cm -3 that is easily detected by hard X-ray photoemission spectroscopy\n(HAXPES) (Figure 7). 1791 Though angle-dependent HAXPES\nanalysis shows that near-VBM states are concentrated at most surface regions in the a-IGZO films fabricated by pulsed laser deposition (PLD), [80] they are nearly uniformly distributed in the bulk region in sputter-deposited a-IGZO films. The near-\nVBM states are distributed in wide energy ranges from VBM to VBM + ≈ 1.5 eV peaking at ≈ 2.5 eV from the CBM, giving the subgap optical absorption and subgap light illumination response with photon energies > 2.3 eV, as explained in Figures 3 and 7. Though the near-VBM spectra look structureless, those originating from oxygen vacancy (Vo), and hydrogen can be deconvoluted, as seen in Figure 8 , providing a fingerprint for judging the origin of near-VBM states (see Ref. [81] ).\n\n![6_image_0.png](6_image_0.png)\n\nwww.advancedsciencenews.com **www.pss-a.com**\n\n![6_image_1.png](6_image_1.png)\n\n## 5. Effects Of Post-Deposition Annealing\n\nPost-deposition thermal annealing is necessarily employed to improve hysteresis and instability issues, especially for commercial a-IGZO TFTs. As seen in **Figure 9**, unannealed TFTs exhibit clock-wise hysteresis, but it is effectively suppressed by annealing at 300–400 C. In particular, wet annealing (20% H2O in O2 gas) produces better TFT than dry O2 annealing possibly due to the high oxidation power experienced in the thermal oxidation process of Si[56] (however, note that although wet annealing produces good static TFT performances, there remains the uncertainty that hydrogen incorporated by wet annealing might cause H-induced instability, as will be discussed later). Hereafter, we will use\n\"high-quality (HQ)\" and \"low-quality (LQ)\" films to simply specify the fabrication conditions of a-IGZO films and TFTs.\n\nHQ is always used for \"optimized\" fabrication condition to exhibit the best TFT performance while LQ is used for \"offoptimized\" conditions where some PLD laser power, sputtering RF power, oxygen partial pressure, annealing temperature/ atmosphere are, for instance, chosen differently from the optimized condition.\n\nIt is an important and remarkable feature of AOS TFTs that good TFT characteristics are easily obtained if annealed at 300–\n400 C in air or O2 even if a pristine TFT is fabricated under the off-optimized condition (low PLD laser power, denoted LQ) and exhibits poor performance, as seen in **Figure 10**.\n\n[7] However, we should recognize that it does not mean that annealed LQ films actually have low defect densities like those fabricated under the optimized condition (HQ). Figure 10 (Left) shows that HQ films possess small subgap optical absorptions in the hν region lower than Eg3.0 eV, but annealed LQ films maintain rather strong subgap absorptions and high-density defects in the bandgap, as seen in Figure 10 (right) though the annealed LQ TFTs exhibit good characteristics similar to HQ TFTs with small subgap optical absorptions and defects. This apparent contradiction is explained by the electronic structure in Figure 6. That is, unannealed LQ films possess very high-densities near-VBM\nstates and offer strong subgap absorptions, while unannealed HQ films possess rather small ones and small subgap absorptions. Annealing reduces the near-VBM states but is not satisfactory in annealed LQ films. However, deep defects such as near-VBM states are inert for static characteristics of nchannel TFTs especially for wide bandgap channels such as AOS.\n\nThis result, in turn, means that we should not judge the quality of AOS channels only from the static TFT characteristics, but we must also optimize the deposition condition so as to minimize the defects and subgap optical absorption in the unannealed states so as to fabricate good and stable TFTs.\n\nFor bulk defects in a-IGZO, it is reported that the number of electron traps at 0.2 eV from CBM are reduced by annealing at 300 C, as explained in Figure 6.[76,82] These results suggest that annealing at 300 C or higher wouldinduce structural relaxationin AOS and generate more stable structures and reduce the number of bulk and surface defects. We will present experimental evidence of the structural relaxation later in section 6. The reduced instability achieved through annealing is also confirmed by stress tests, for example, as seen in the CCS result in Figure 2 that\n\n![7_image_0.png](7_image_0.png)\n\n![7_image_1.png](7_image_1.png)\n\n![7_image_3.png](7_image_3.png)\n\n![7_image_2.png](7_image_2.png)\n\nFigure 9.  A 400°C-annealing effects on hysteresis of a-ICZO TFTs. a) Unannealed, (b) annealed in dry O 2 , and (c) annealed in wet O 2 with 20% H 2 O.\n\n![8_image_1.png](8_image_1.png)\n\n![8_image_0.png](8_image_0.png)\n\nsuggests that the current- induced creation of extra deep traps is suppressed by structural stabilization through annealing. As for the annealing issue related to surface states, SIMS study reveals that the surface of unannealed a-IGZO is reactive while thermal annealing at ≥ 300 ° C weakens the reactivity (in other words, the surface is stabilized by annealing) whose effect is more evident in the case of wet annealing. 172 Several annealing atmospheres have been examined, including atmospheric air, dry O2 gas, wet O2 gas, O3containing O 2 , Ar, N 2 , H 2 , and H plasma. Thermal annealing may have several different results such as 1) induce structural relaxation to form more stable local structures; 2) reduce the number of defects (including point defects and complex defects); 3) remove weakly bonded species; 4) control donor density and conductivity; and 5) generate macroscopic defects\n(grain boundaries and voids). Results 1)–2) can be controlled mainly by the annealing temperature, while the annealing temperature and time would be important for 3) because its process needs the diffusion of O, H, etc., to remove weakly bonded species. For 4), the annealing atmosphere as well as the annealing temperature and time are important. If the a-IGZO\nfilm is deposited in a reducing atmosphere and has high electron density, it should be oxidized, for example, by air, O 2 or wet O 2 (H 2 O) annealing. SIMS analysis reveals that 300 °C is required for enough in-diffusion of O from O 2 gas to obtain 1%\nof oxygen replacement at 15 nm depth from the surface, while H 2 O annealing yields faster in-diffusion (1% replacement is attained at ≈ 15 nm depth at 200°C, ≈ 30 nm at 300°C, and\n>50 nm at 400 C). [72] Actually, it is reported that wet O2 annealing is more effective than dry O 2 annealing to enhance TFT performance, reduce the number of defects, and improve uniformity (Figure 11). [83] However, note that instability issues related to hydrogen appeared in the report in ref. [83] (see ref. [84] for hydrogen instability), and it was also reported that though high-temperature wet annealing at ≥ 300 ° C produces good TFTs, low-temperature wet annealing at < 200°C causes serious negative V th . 1851 Therefore, the employment of wet annealing should be considered in relation to the advantages of the strong oxidation power/the faster diffusion of H 2 O and the disadvantages of H-related instability. O 3 annealing is another way for employing active O atoms to achieve better oxidation at lower temperatures, as O 3 is decomposed to O 2 (molecule) + O\n(atom) at the film surface. In fact, good TFTs are obtained through low-temperature (150 ° C) O 3 annealing. [86]\nH annealing is usually employed for doping electrons because the incorporation of H produces shallow donors in oxide semiconductors, as will be discussed later. Ar or N 2 annealing have also been reported to improve TFT characteristics. Usually, these reducing annealing atmospheres generate oxygen deficiency and shallow donors in oxide semiconductors, while some papers report\n\n![9_image_0.png](9_image_0.png)\n\nwww.advancedsciencenews.com **www.pss-a.com**\n\n![9_image_1.png](9_image_1.png)\n\nthat such reducing annealing atmospheres reduce electron density and improve the properties of the semiconductor and TFT stability. Although its mechanism is not clear yet, some explanations would be possible: 1) remove impurity, H and related shallow donors, and 2) introduce electron traps related to the oxygen vacancy.\n\n## 6. Defect Reduction, Creation, Structural Relaxation, And Crystallization By Annealing\n\nFigure 12 shows the dependences of the annealing temperature for a-IGZO TFT transfer curves and parameters.[77] It is seen that annealing at 200–300 C achieves the best performance with the largest saturation mobility (μsat). According to the spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) result in **Figure 13**, film densification is not detected at 300 C though the TFT performances are improved\n(Figure 12) and the optical bandgap Eg increases in this temperature region.[87] As the optical Eg increase would be due to the reduction of the tail states, the improvement of the TFT up to 300 C annealing would be ascribed to the annihilation of point defects (note these small defects are hard to be detected by usual structural characterizations) and the reduction of tail states.\n\nConversely, annealing at 400 C degrades TFT performance although structural relaxation and densification occur in this temperature range, as seen in Figure 12. It can be understood through the thermal desorption spectra (TDS) in **Figure 14**. The H2O desorption terminates at 400 C, and this threshold temperature corresponds to the starting temperature for TFT\ndegradation in Figure 12. It is further confirmed that rehydrogenation recovers the TFT characteristics (**Figure 15**).\n\nThese results support the idea that some hydrogen passivate electron traps in a-IGZO similar to a-Si:H, whose energy levels are located at 0.3 eV below the CBM and the related hydrogen desorbs at 400 C.\n\nAnnealing at higher temperatures over 600 C causes crystallization, as shown in **Figure 16**.\n\n[87,88] Note that the structural relaxation depends on the as-deposited states. While HQ film (i.e., deposited at the optimum condition and has a high film density)\nshows no detectable relaxation up to 400 C, LQ films (offoptimized conditions and low film density) start to relax from very low temperatures, for example, 100 C, as shown in **Figure 17**.\n\n[87,89,90] Probably related to this structural relaxation behavior, the crystallization onset temperature (TX) for AOS also depends on the deposition condition and structure, as shown in Figure 18. The optimized condition for PLD (PO2¼ 1 Pa) shows TX 600 C, similar to the above sputtering case, while oxygendeficient a-IGZO film exhibits lower TX 500 C. More detailed study on the crystallization of various AOSs is reported in ref. [88].\n\n![10_image_0.png](10_image_0.png)\n\n![10_image_1.png](10_image_1.png)\n\nFigure 12.

We may expect that high-temperature growth would produce stable and low defect density AOS films, but the temperature margin is not large for AOS growth; that is, the growth of IGZO transitions to crystalline growth from ≈ 175 ° C (for instance, it was reported to be 190°C in ref.

[94] reports that some a-\nIGZO films would be crystallized during transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations, and gives rise to a caution that very careful sample preparation and observation conditions\n\n![11_image_1.png](11_image_1.png)\n\nshould be chosen to correctly judge whether the sample is\n\n![11_image_0.png](11_image_0.png)\n\namorphous or crystalline.\n\nFigure 16 also shows that the crystallization of a-IGZO is an inhomogeneous process seeding from the film surface if annealed at low temperatures, for example, at 600 ° C, while homogeneous crystallization from the bulk inside occurs at high-temperature crystallization, for example, at 1000°C. In particular, inhomogeneous crystallization from the top surface produces c-axis oriented crystallites. Sharp employs partially crystallized IGZO in small to medium-sized LCDs called C-axis Aligned Crystalline (CAAC) IGZO in collaboration with SEL. 1951 In fact, some oxides, including ZnO [96] and layered crystals such as InGaZnO 4 , [91] exhibit c-axis preferential growth. SEL reports their crystalline growth conditions in refs. [97,98], where crystalline growth starts from < 200 ° C\nsubstrate temperature, and subsequent annealing, for example, at 450 °C enhances the growth.\n\n## 7. Oxygen-Related Defects 7.1. Oxygen Vacancy/Deficiencies\n\nRecently, first-principles calculations achieved high reliability for materials including heavy metals such as AOSs and provided much information about electronic structures and defect states that have actually been applied to AOSs. [42,99-101]\nFigure 21 shows the pseudo-band structures of a-IGZO with oxygen deficiencies calculated by DFT. [102,103] It is reported that an oxygen deficiency could not only be a deep electron trap but also a shallow donor depending on its local structure. If a large free space remains at a vacancy site, such oxygen vacancy ( Vo )\nforms a deep level in the band gap and traps electrons\n(Figure 21b). This is similar to Vo in crystalline ZnO[104-106]\nand in inorganic electrides such as C12A7:e − [107] Conversely, if such free space is annihilated by a growth condition or thermal annealing process, a shallow donor level is formed, as seen in Figure 21c. The deep states formed with large spaces lie in the deep energy just above VBM and are capable of explaining the near-VBM states observed by HAXPES in Figures 7 and 8. However, this is still of controversy because DFT calculations underestimate bandgap and the calculated defect levels include large ambiguities. Actually, more sophisticated self- interaction correction (SIC) calculations [108] and hybrid DFT calculations[109.110] indicate that the Vo states should lie at shallower energy levels and rather close to the mid-bandgap than the near- VBM states observed by HAXPES. Conversely, the deconvoluted HAXPES for Vo in Figure 8 indicates that the Vo states are close to the VBM, and H- related defects lie around the midbandgap.\n\nThe near-VBM states are observed as subgap optical absorptions, as explained in Figure 7, and subgap optical absorptions typically follows exponential decays down to\n≈ 2.5 eV at an absorption coefficient, α of 10 2 cm − 1 , as shown in the Ro2 = [O2]/([O2] + [Ar]) = 1–10% films in Figure 22a.[11] Here, we like to note that a very different subgap absorption is observed in a-IGZO films deposited without oxygen supply, as seen in Ro2 = 0%. If a-IGZO films is deposited at Ro2 = 0%, strong subgap absorption extending to <0.5 eV appears and the\n\n![12_image_0.png](12_image_0.png)\n\nwww.advancedsciencenews.com **www.pss-a.com**\n\n![12_image_1.png](12_image_1.png)\n\nresultant films exhibit dark colors from brown to black, as seen\n\n![12_image_2.png](12_image_2.png)\n\nin the photograph (Figure 22b). HAXPES is used to directly observe the level of these trap states. The dark color film deposited without O2 supply shows near-VBM states, with an extra shallow band extending to the Fermi level, EF, being consistent with the optical absorption spectrum. This extra state is assigned to segregated In metal (In0), as seen in Figure 22d.\n\nHere, we like to note that the assignment of the near-VBM\nstates is still of controversy as explained above: SIC and hybrid DFT calculations indicate that VO should lie near the midbandgap while the experimental data relate the near-VBM states to oxygen deficient fabrication conditions. In addition, Sallis et al. reported that the density of the near-VBM states has a positive correlation with the oxygen composition and is not consistent with the VO model even though the metal compositions of their a-IGZO films exhibit very large distributions and the near-VBM states might also be affected by variations in the metal composition.[112]\nUsually, electron density and electrical conductivity of oxide semiconductors monotonically increases with decreasing RO2 during film deposition because lower RO2 introduces more oxygen deficiencies and generates more electron donors.\n\nHowever, this is not always true for AOS. **Figure 23**a shows the variation in electrical resistivity as a function of partial oxygen pressure during PLD deposition (PO2). It is seen that the resistivity decreases with decreasing PO2 but suddenly increases at 0.1 Pa. This can be explained by the above DFT result that VO with free space works as an electron trap in AOS (Figure 21b). Actually, the film density decreases at PO2 < 0.1 Pa, as seen in Figure 23c. Such deep VO states are observed by HAXPES as high-density near-VBM states, as seen in the PO2 ¼ 0 Pa data in Figure 23b. This result indicates that an oxygen deficiency condition usually generates free electrons in oxide semiconductors but the formation of lowdensity structures with large free spaces in AOS can produce high-density electron traps and cause serious charge compensations.\n\n## 7.2. Excess/Interstitial/Weakly Bonded Oxygen\n\nThough oxygen is the major constituent of AOS, oxygen sometimes forms an electron trap; for example, a neutral oxygen atom incorporated to a charge neutral AOS framework can capture one or two electrons by O0 þ ne ¼ >On (n ¼ 1 or 2),\nworking as an electron trap. In addition, such oxygen is expected to be \"excess\" in terms of the charge neutral stoichiometry of the AOS framework (this excess oxygen situation can also be\n\n![13_image_0.png](13_image_0.png)\n\n![13_image_1.png](13_image_1.png)\n\nregarded as \"interstitial oxygen\" from the viewpoint of the framework) and also expected to have weaker chemical bonds in the framework. Actually, excess/interstitial/weakly bonded oxygen is experimentally confirmed through TDS and chemical composition analyses. It is reported that O 3 annealing at 30 ° C introduces weakly bonded oxygen that is confirmed by low-temperature (from < 100°C) O 2 desorption in the TDS\nspectrum in Figure 24a. The bistable TFT transfer curves in Figure 24b,c reveals that such weakly bonded oxygen has a negative-U characteristic and takes bistable states that are converted by electron capture with applying positive V GS\n(Figure 24b) and electron release by photoexcitation with photon energies > 2.3 eV (Figure 24c), giving the electronic state model in Figure 25. [113]\nThough such O 3 annealing is not the standard process for display manufacturing, similar weakly bonded oxygen is also observed in standard sputtering deposition; that is, the too high RO2 condition during deposition produces a-IGZO TFTs that exhibit similar bistable behaviors. Figure 26 shows three cyclic measurements of transfer curves for pristine TFTs just after TFT fabrication at RT. It is seen that all the pristine transfer curves for TFTs fabricated with Ro2 = 3–10% give turn-on voltages Von ≈0 V, while the second and third cycle transfer curves give large positive Von that increases from\n≈ 15 to 80 Vas R O2 increases from 3 to 10%. Similar to the case for O 3 annealing at 300 ° C, the large positive Von states are recovered by light illumination with photon energies > 2.3 eV, as shown in Figure 26b. These weakly bonded oxygen behaviors was theoretically explained by the O—O dimer bond model proposed by Han et al. [114]\n\n![13_image_2.png](13_image_2.png)\n\n![14_image_0.png](14_image_0.png)\n\nwww.advancedsciencenews.com **www.pss-a.com**\n\n![14_image_1.png](14_image_1.png)\n\nThe above experimental results do not indicate whether the weakly bonded oxygen is in excess. It was experimentally confirmed through Rutherford backscattering (RBS) measurements, revealing that high total pressure (PTOT) sputtering deposition at 2.0 Pa gives the chemical composition of InGa0.96Zn0.61O4.11, whose oxygen content is 8% excess compared to the total number of atoms in the charge-neutral molecular formula, In3þGa3þ0.96Zn2þ0.61O23.55.\n\n[82]\nCd-Ge-O.[17] This is also the case for a-IGZO.[71] **Figure 27** shows the effect of hydrogen doping through H2 annealing and H plasma treatments, showing that the electron density in a-IGZO is enhanced by H doping up to 1020 cm3 (this value may be the dopinglimit of electrons byHin a-IGZO).This experimental result is also supported by DFT calculation, showing that hydrogen incorporated in stoichiometric a-IGZO forms ─OH bond and ionizes the doped hydrogen to Hþ and generates a free electron, as described in ref. [103]. It should also be noted that hydrogen exhibits not only the Hþ state but also the H state in oxides, as predicted by DFT calculations for ZnO,[118] followed by similar DFT works on H in InGaZnO4.\n\n[119,120] Even though no experimental evidence of H in ZnO and crystalline oxide\n\n## 8. Hydrogen-Related Defects\n\nThe incorporation of hydrogen into oxide semiconductors serves\n\n![14_image_2.png](14_image_2.png)\n\nas electron donors, as experienced in crystalline ZnO[115–117] and a-\n\n![15_image_1.png](15_image_1.png)\n\n![15_image_0.png](15_image_0.png)\n\nsemiconductors has been reported, H  in a-IGZO is experimentally confirmed. [110] implying also that H + (i.e., − OH) in a-IGZO is not so stable and desorbs completely at < T x , while H − at the O 2 − site is stable even in crystallized films.\n\nIn a-IGZO films used for TFTs, hydrogen is not intentionally doped, but actually doped at high densities > 10 20 cm − (ref. [111] reports that 1/3 of H exists as H 7 and 2/3 as —OH in a-IGZO films deposited by conventional sputtering).\n\nThe unintentional hydrogen doping originates from the residual gasses in the growth chamber (note that the base pressures of conventional sputtering chambers are not good, typically Pbase ≈ 10 − 4 Pa that comes mainly from H 2 O and also from H 2 , etc.) and from the supplied gasses such as O 2 and Ar (mainly H 2 O). Use of ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) sputtering chamber (Pbase ~ 10~7 Pa) combined with gas purifiers (to remove H 2 O and H 2 from Ar and O 2 gasses) confirmed that the concentration of H in the resultant a-IGZO films is reduced to the order of 10 19 cm −3 (the measured values reached the detection limit of the SIMS apparatus). [ 121 ]\nHere, we should consider why device-quality a-IGZO films have low electron densities < 10 15 cm − 3 even though they contain high- density impurities of H. As explained in Figure 27, the experimental and theoretical calculation results all indicate that the hydrogen incorporation forms shallow donors, and typical device-quality a-IGZO films deposited by conventional sputtering with Pbase ≈ 10 − 4 Pa include hydrogen at densities > 10 20 cm − 3 that are much higher than the free electron densities < 10 15 cm − 3 . This apparent contradiction can be explained by the charge compensation model; that is, we tune the deposition and post- deposition annealing conditions so as to obtain low free electron density semiconducting films, whose conditions are naturally chosen to incorporate excess oxygen so that most of the free electrons generated from the impurity of H are compensated by the excess oxygen. [71] This model is confirmed by changing Pbase for PLD deposition. [122] Figure 28 shows N c as a function of P O2 for PLD-deposited a-IGZO films.\n\nIt can be clearly seen that the poorer Pbase needs much more oxygen supply to suppress N c . In such a-IGZO films (the H\nconcentration of the poorer P base film is ≈ 10 22 cm − 3 , one order of magnitude higher than that of the good P base film), incorporation of extra H and generation of H-related extra defects was confirmed by TDS, HAXPES near-VBM spectra, and subgap optical absorption similar to the characterizations explained above.\n\n![16_image_2.png](16_image_2.png)\n\n## 9. Macroscopic Structural Defects (Microstructure)\n\nThe total pressure (working pressure) during deposition, PTOT has a significant impact on the microstructure of the film. Usually, it is difficult to characterize the structure of amorphous films, but the film density can be obtained through X-ray reflectivity spectroscopy (XRR) analysis. In addition, high-angle-annular-dark-field mode of scanning transmission microscopy (HAADF-STEM) can provide a high-sensitivity technique for observing microstructures in AOSs because its contrast is proportional to the square of the atomic number, Z 2 and sensitive to the electron density. As seen in\n\n![16_image_1.png](16_image_1.png)\n\n![16_image_0.png](16_image_0.png)\n\nFigure 29, [89] the optimum P TOT = 0.55 Pa provides a high density of 6.1 g cm − 3 (≈ 5% lower than that of crystalline InGaZnO 4 [891 )\nwhile a high P TOT = 5.0 Pa yields a much lower density of 5.5 g cm − 3 in the as-deposited states up to 500 ° C annealing. The increase in the density at > 500–600 ° C is attributed to crystallization, as explained above. One important feature of the high P TOT\n\n![17_image_1.png](17_image_1.png)\n\n![17_image_0.png](17_image_0.png)\n\nfilms is that they include high-density weakly bonded species. As the chemical compositions of P TOT = 0.55 and 5.0 films are InGa 0.9 Zn 0.6 O 3.45 and InGa 0.84 Zn 0.81 O 3.57 (the metal compositions were measured by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF), and the oxygen compositions were estimated through the ion charge neutrality condition), the above density difference ≈ 10%\ncannot be explained by the average atomic mass that corresponds to the ion packing density. Figure 29b shows the total amounts of desorbed molecules integrated up to 600 ° C in TDS spectra, showing that the optimum PTOT = 0.55 Pa exhibits the minimum desorption amount while P TOT ≥ 2.0 Pa exhibits much larger amounts of H 2 O, O 2 , H 2 , and Ar desorption (these were detected by TDS. Ar can also be detected by PES and RBS [82] ). These desorptions start from ≈ 80°C, implying that the high PTOT films incorporate much weakly bonded O and H. The TFT transfer curves in Figure 29c,d show that the high P TOT = 5.0 Pa TFT\nexhibits poor performance with very high V on and low on current\n( Ion ), similar to TFTs incorporating weakly bonded O, as explained above. However, if the high PTOT TFTs were annealed, for example, at 300°C, the resultant transfer curve becomes similar to those of the optimum P TOT = 0.55 Pa TFTs. Such behavior (i.e., thermal annealing at ≥ 300 ° C produces apparently good TFTs even if the a-\nIGZO channel is deposited at an off-optimized condition and the unannealed TFT exhibits poor performance) is a remarkable characteristic of AOS TFTs, as discussed in section 5. Also explained in section 5, this does not mean that thermal annealing can produce high-quality, low-defect density AOS films, and TFTs.\n\nActually, Figure 10 shows that the annealed LQ TFTs still have much larger densities of subgap states compared to those of HQ even though annealed LQ TFTs exhibited good performances similar to unannealed and annealed HQ TFTs.\n\nSuch a difference was also observed by the HAADF- STEM\nimages in Figure 30. The 5.0 Pa film has a porous columnar structure while the optimum 0.55 Pa film has much uniform structure although a slight evolution of the columnar structure can be detected near the surface region. Here, we like to note that the effect of film density on TFT characteristics and defect density in a-IGZO TFT was first noted by Jeong et al., who reported that lower pressure deposition achieves fewer defects. [123] Figure 31 shows the evolution of the HAADF-STEM\nimages for high-density (HQ) and low-density (LQ) a-IGZO\nfilms. As noted above, low-density films have columnar structures like vertical voids in the unannealed state, while the vertical voids are converted to closed voids along with a reduction in the thickness upon thermal annealing. It was reported in the sintering process for ceramics that such closed pores are hardly removed by subsequent sintering processes if molecules such as O 2 and H 2 O are included. This result also indicates that annealed low-density a-IGZO would contain several closed void structures, far different from the high- density a-IGZO even if those TFTs exhibit similar good characteristics.\n\nThese extra defects in off-optimized a-IGZO films would cause extra instability issues even if the annealed TFTs exhibit good static characteristics similar to HQ TFTs. This implies that\n\n![18_image_1.png](18_image_1.png)\n\nthe film deposition condition must be finely tuned so that good TFT performances are obtained without thermal annealing.\n\nIt should also be noted that even in high-density films, the growth mode changes at ≈ 20 nm (threshold thickness) with a\n\n![18_image_2.png](18_image_2.png)\n\n![18_image_0.png](18_image_0.png)\n\nstructural change from a dense uniform structure to a slightly columnar structure, as shown in Figure 30a that is more evident in the low-density film in Figure 30b. Usually, the channel thicknesses of a-IGZO TFTs are less than 80 nm, probably because the electrical conductivity of a-IGZO films significantly increases and TFT exhibits negative V th when the channel thickness exceeds 100 nm that would be related to this kind of growth mode/microstructure change. The reduction of H impurity through UHV sputtering increases the threshold thickness at least up to 100 nm.\n\n## 10. Possible Reactions And Mechanisms Of Various Instability Modes\n\nHere, we try to summarize the current knowledge of defects in AOSs to understand the possible mechanisms of various instability issues.\n\n![19_image_0.png](19_image_0.png)\n\n![19_image_1.png](19_image_1.png)\n\n## 10.1. Temperature Instability\n\nAOS often shows large temperature instability in electrical properties, especially if it is deposited at the off-optimized condition and not subjected to thermal annealing. Ref. [83] reports that the conductivity of unannealed a-IGZO films that initially have rather low conductivities σ < 10 − 3 S cm − 1 increase largely up to ≈ 10 3 S cm − 1 as the annealing temperature increases from RT to 300°C even under dry and wet O 2 atmospheres (Figure 32). The σ starts to decrease from 30°C and finally recovers to low values ≈ 10 3 S cm\n(corresponding to ANc ~1020cm~3 upon supposition of mobility) if kept at 400°C for 1 h. This 10 cm 2 V − 1 s − 1 phenomenon is more clearly seen in the time variation of σ during temperature raising and maintaining period, as shown in Figure 33 . The first increase in σ during annealing up to 30 ° C would be ascribed to several possible mechanisms: 1)\nincrease in shallow donors; 2) decrease in electron traps; 3) desorption of oxygen and generation of oxygen deficiency, 4) incorporation of atmospheric molecules like H 2 O, etc. In the\n\n![19_image_2.png](19_image_2.png)\n\n![20_image_0.png](20_image_0.png)\n\nphysica www.advancedsciencenews.com **www.pss-a.com**\n\n![20_image_1.png](20_image_1.png)\n\ncase of ref. [83], 1.7  1019 cm3 of H2O desorption was observed\n\n![20_image_2.png](20_image_2.png) while those of H2 (4.7  1017) and O2 (1.7  1017) were much lower than those for the H2O desorption. Therefore, the H2O desorption is the most plausible reason for the increase in σ. Even though the increase in Ne can be explained by some reactions such as MOH þ MOH ¼ >VO\n2þ þ MOM þ H2O\" þ 2e\n, the amount of H2O desorption is still far less than ΔNe. Therefore, we should also consider the reduction of electron traps. As seen in previous sections, AOS can incorporate many different electron traps such as weakly bonded O (note that this is located at similar energy levels to near-VBM states upon electrons capture) and VO. In particular, weakly bonded species start to desorb from very low temperatures such as 80 C.[113]\nNear-VBM states assignable to VO also starts to decrease from low temperatures and up to 300 C.[124] The desorption/\nannihilation of these electron traps releases free electrons to the conduction band. In particular, the densities of the near-VBM\nstates are >>1020 cm3 and its annihilation by annealing can quantitatively explain the large ΔNe. Conversely, the case of Figure 33a corresponds to ΔNe 1016 cm3 while other mechanisms including the desorption of charged weakly bonded species and H2/H2O desorption (e.g., by 2H ¼> H2\" þ 2e\n.\n\n![21_image_0.png](21_image_0.png)\n\n![21_image_1.png](21_image_1.png)\n\n## 10.2. Positive Gate Bias And Current Instability\n\nUsually or in several cases, the stress conditions cause positive ∆ V th . The possible mechanisms responsible for this are: 1)\nnegative charge trap in the gate insulator/interface; 2) creation of electron traps in the channel; 3) reduction of shallow donors in the channel, etc. Ref. [56] noted that the reduction of donors was not possible and mainly ascribed this to the creation of electron traps (case 1 is excluded because that study employed thermally oxidized SiO 2 on Si wafer as a gate insulator). Other reports also examined charge trapping issues in gate insulators.[44,49,126,127]\nUraoka et al. reported that Joule heating is also important for inducing instability, especially for highly resistive/low mobility AOS TFTs. In other words, high-mobility AOS TFTs such as In-\nSn-Zn-O (ITZO) are more robust for PBS and CCS. [55,128]\nTable 1. Typical RF sputtering parameters for obtaining good TFT\ncharacteristics with our apparatus (Canon Anelva, Japan, E-200S-TK).\n\n![22_image_2.png](22_image_2.png)\n\n## 10.3. Negative Gate Bias Instability\n\nGood AOS TFTs usually do not show NBS instability, as seen in Figure 5a, suggesting that the creation of extra defects and/or structural changes would not be induced if high electrical current is not provided. Negative AV th can explained by the opposite processes to those for the above positive AV th cases.\n\nThat is, 1) trap of positive charges in the gate insulator/interface;\n\n![22_image_3.png](22_image_3.png)\n\n![22_image_1.png](22_image_1.png)\n\n![22_image_0.png](22_image_0.png)\n\nacceptors in the channel, etc. These will be discussed in detail in the next section.\n\n## 10.4. Light Illumination Instability\n\nLight illumination instability is serious for AOS TFTs even against subgap photons, as explained above. In particular, NBIS causes an increase in I off and a large negative ∆ V th . It is closely related to the slow photo-response of AOS in Figure 4.161] The bistable states of weakly bonded oxygen and its recovery in V th by light illumination (Figures 24–26) is also one type of light illumination instability. [113] However, its microscopic mechanism may have several possible models and is still controversial.\n\nNomura et al. proposed that the migration of holes generated by light illumination and their trap at the interface is a consistent mechanism if the hole mobility is as large as 0.01 cm 2 V − 1 s −\nRyu et al. and several other researcher noted that positively charged Vo may be the origin of trapped positive charges, [129] but it would be hard to expect that Vo diffusion (this is actually the same as O diffusion) has a high enough diffusion constant as the diffusion constant of O, reported to be 1015 cm2 s 1 by SIMS in ref. [72]. There are some mechanisms that do not require longdistance diffusion. Nahm et al. noted that the excitation of valence band electrons (i.e., on O2) form metastable O─O bond\n(peroxy linkage) and release free electrons by O2 þ O2 ¼\n>O2 2 þ 2e\n.\n\n[68] Similarly, Han et al. observed that interstitial oxygen forms O─O dimer bond upon electron capture to account for the experimental weakly bonded oxygen,[113] and also account for light illumination/negative bias instability by the opposite process, as these conditions release electrons.[114] Kang et al.\n\nreported a model of bistable hydrogen; that is, the conversion of H to Hþ can cause persistent photocurrent and negative ΔVth in photo-bias-thermal instability.[69]\n\n## 11. What Determines Optimum A-Igzo Deposition Condition?\n\nSo far, we have seen that it is important to form a densely packed structure to reduce the number of void-related electron traps so as to finely control the oxygen content to minimize weakly bonded/excess oxygen, and to reduce the amount of hydrogen impurity (but not too much) so as to produce good and stable a-IGZO TFTs. Even though thermal annealing at 300 C produces apparently good TFTs, several defects still remain if the a-IGZO channel is deposited at the off-optimized condition; that is, the AOS channel deposition condition should be optimized so as to obtain good TFT performances without annealing. Here, we will discuss how to control the deposition condition to obtain such films.\n\nHere, we explain the deposition methods. PLD was first used for making a-IGZO films and TFTs[1] because it can easily control the chemical compositions of complex oxides such as IGZO. The growth of AOS growth can be achieved by a variety of film growth methods, including DC/AC/RF sputtering, sol-gel solution process, etc. For mass production, especially for flat panel displays, DC/AC sputtering are preferred because of the large fabrication area and compatibility with present display technology. Thus, hereafter, we focus on the optimum condition for sputtering.\n\nTable 1 summarizes the typical optimum deposition conditions for our RF magnetron sputtering system. It is well known that in oxide conductors such as indium tin oxide (ITO),\nthe carrier concentration can be modified by changing PO2 (in other words, RO2). Similarly, the conductivity of a-IGZO films is mainly controlled by RO2, as shown in **Figure 34**a. Comparing the corresponding TFT transfer curves in Figure 34b, the condition for obtaining good TFT is empirically chosen to as carrier concentrations of 1012–1015 cm3 or conductivities (σ) of 106–103 S cm1. Note that the optimum RO2 value would be different, depending on the apparatuses used for the deposition or other deposition parameters. In particular, Pbase and the residual H in the deposition chamber cause critical differences in the optimum RO2 to obtain the above optimum σ, as explained in Figure 28. For other deposition parameters, higher sputtering power and smaller target-substrate (TS) distances generally produces better TFTs (**Figure 35**). As shown in Figure 29–31, a lower PTOT is also better. These conditions would be the opposite of the conditions for crystalline semiconductors and devices because these AOS conditions produce higher energy deposition precursors and yield more serious ion bombardment damages\n(e.g., by breaking metal cation-oxygen bonds[130]) to the growing films. However, AOS films are usually deposited at room temperature or rather low temperatures, and deposition precursors attached to the growth surface cannot have enough thermal energy to migrate and to form relaxed stable structures. Therefore, high kinetic energy should be provided to the deposition precursors via the sputtering process. The extra defects created by high-energy ion bombardment are reduced in number by subsequent annealing. Higher sputtering powers produces higher-energy precursors, while smaller TS distances and lower PTOT reduces the number of collisions between the precursors and the gaseous molecules/atoms in the plasma to retain the kinetic energy of the precursors, leading to more efficient surface relaxation in the vicinity of the growing surface and to reduced number of defects. These conditions also lead to higher deposition rates and suppress the incorporation of impurity species such as H2O and excess O2 from the deposition atmosphere. This trend is more clearly observed in amorphous Ga-O (a-GO),[131] where semiconducting a-GO films are obtained only when the film density is increased to >5.2 g cm3 by\n\n![23_image_0.png](23_image_0.png)\n\nwww.advancedsciencenews.com **www.pss-a.com**\n\n![23_image_1.png](23_image_1.png)\n\nwww.advancedsciencenews.com **www.pss-a.com**\n\n![24_image_1.png](24_image_1.png)\n\n![24_image_2.png](24_image_2.png)\n\n![24_image_0.png](24_image_0.png)\n\nincreasing the growth rate >15 nm min1, which are achieved through high power PLD deposition (**Figure 36**). As discussed above, fine control of PO2 is also critical in reducing electron traps and for producing conductive a-GO films; that is, too small PO2 produces deep electron traps (near-VBM states) while too high PO2 incorporates weakly bonded O & H2O and forms lowdensity structures with free spaces to generate electron traps as well. To reduce the amount of H impurity, the use of gas purifier and employing high growth rate deposition are helpful during manufacturing (note that UHV sputtering can also reduce the amount of H impurity but is not easily available for manufacturing).\n\nFigure 37 shows a typical fabrication process for a-IGZO TFT\nwith an etching stopper layer (ESL) that is similar to the inverted staggered a-Si:H TFTs. Typical gate insulators and ESLs consist of SiO2 and/or SiNx:H deposited by plasma chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or sputtering. Note that deposition conditions should also be determined in consideration of H-incorporation. For the bottom gate insulator, the H issue is less serious because its deposition process employs high-temperature deposition, for example, 350 C to reduce the amount of residual H. Conversely, the top ESL layer should be carefully formed by controlling the temperature and residual H.[132] At high-temperature deposition, hydrogen diffuses from the plasma to the a-IGZO layer during the deposition and causes serious negative ΔVth, even if\n\n![24_image_3.png](24_image_3.png)\n\nthe residual H in the ESL layer is low. While at low-temperature deposition, high-density H contained in the ESL layer causes instability issues. Therefore, the deposition and post-deposition annealing temperatures should be finely tuned, for example, between 175 and 250 C.\n\nThere are several methods for depositing AOS films reported to date, including sputtering, mist-CVD, MOCVD, and solution process. Currently, sputtering is the only deposition method employed for the mass production of aIGZO TFT backplanes. As explained in ref. [4], polyInGaZnO4 rotatory target and monolithic planer target are supplied by several companies. As shown in **Figure 38**, the color of the target InGaZnO4 target is a simple and good indicator of the carrier density and conductivity. As crystalline InGaZnO4 is a transparent oxide semiconductor with a bandgap of 3.7 eV, the color of a stoichiometric target should be white as seen in Figure 38a. Conversely, InGaZnO4 is reduced by higher temperature sintering and/or sintering in reducing atmospheres such as in N2, and turns gray and finally black (Figure 38b). For PLD and RF/AC sputtering, the targets can be insulated. Conversely, many commercial processes employ DC magnetron sputtering, for example, to increase the deposition rate and reduce the tact time, but it\n\n![25_image_0.png](25_image_0.png)\n\nwww.advancedsciencenews.com **www.pss-a.com**\n\n![25_image_1.png](25_image_1.png)\n\nSome of the new functional AOS materials were recently found. Amorphous GaO was reported as an ultra-wide bandgap semiconductor that can be used for novel phosphor materials.[133–136] Amorphous Zn-Si-O and amorphous Ca-Al-O were developed for electron transport layers and electron injection layers for top-emission inverted OLED.[137–139] Amorphous p-type Cu-Sn-I semiconductor offers high mobility p-type semiconductors fabricated at RT by solution processes, though it is not an oxide.[140]\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThe authors acknowledged Drs.

The insufficient oxygen supply from the targets is compensated for by the O2 gas supply during sputtering deposition to produce highly resistive, high-quality, stoichiometric a-IGZO films. However, there remains an open question about the effect of the off-stoichiometry of the sputtering target on the instability of AOS TFTs.\n\n## 12. Conclusion\n\nWe reviewed the defects in AOSs and discussed the origins of TFT instabilities and their optimum fabrication conditions.\n\nSeveral defects have been clarified in the past 10 years, but their microscopic origins are not satisfactorily clear, and the instability issues were not satisfactorily solved although several commercial FPDs employ IGZO TFTs. Deeper investigation of the origins of the defects and production methods for controlling them along with stable high-mobility AOS materials will be inevitable especially for near-future applications such as very high-resolution, high-speed and large displays like >8 K\n88 inch OLED, really flexible/foldable displays, transparent displays, and CPU/memory integrated displays and circuits.\n\n[1] K.

The required field-effect mobility of oxide-based TFTs has been increasing rapidly to meet the demands of the high-resolution, large panel size and 3D displays in the market. In this regard, the current status and major trends in the high mobility oxide-based TFTs are briefly reviewed. The various approaches, including the use of semiconductor, dielectric, electrode materials and the corresponding device structures for realizing high mobility oxide-based TFT devices are discussed. \n\nKeywords: Metal oxide semiconductors, High mobility TFT, Flat panel displays\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nFlat panel displays (FPDs) are thin electronic devices and a frequent feature widely used in our daily lives; e.g. laptops, smartphones, tablets, and 3D/high-definition (HD) curved televisions (TVs). According to the market statistics, transparent and flexible display revenue will reach $87.2 billion by 2025 \n[1,2]. Most of the leading FPDs manufacturers across the globe, i.e. Samsung, LG, and Sharp are investing huge money for nextgeneration flat panel technology. The current FPD industry is being driven towards the development of future generation HD technology, such as ultra-definition (UD, or 4 K×2 K) and/ or super hi-vision (8 K×4 K), large area (>70\"), high frame rate \n† Author to whom all correspondence should be addressed:\nE-mail: yi@yurim.skku.ac.kr Copyright ©2015 KIEEME.

In 2013, a 55\" active matrix (AM)-OLED TV (LG Electronics), with options for curved/ flat panels, was available in commercial markets [4]. Recently, LG had commercialized 55\", 65\", and 77\" 4 K OLED TVs [5]. In order to realize such high end products like ultra-HD (UHD) TVs that do not require specialized glasses, using either AM-LCDs or AM-OLED panels, and high-performance thin-film transistor \n(TFT) devices acting as driving elements are necessary, preferably with field-effect mobility (μFE) values over 30 cm2/V-s, (as shown in Fig. 1; depending on display resolution and frame rate) [6], because OLED pixels need high current in order to emit light through current injection. Since the publication of the seminal paper by Nomura, et al. [7] in 2004, the amorphous oxide-based semiconductor materials has emerged as a strong candidate to be the backplane technology for next-generation UHD AM-LCD/ AM-OLED panels. They offer high mobility, good transparency to visible light, and excellent uniformity for a large area, compared with conventional a-Si and poly-Si TFTs [3,8,9]. Therefore, the \n\n![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)\n\ndiscussion on the challenges as well as overall understanding for improving mobility of oxide-based TFTs is timely for nextgeneration FPD applications. In this review paper, various approaches for the improvement of mobility in oxide-based TFTs are discussed including designs of semiconductor (as the active channel), dielectric, electrode materials as well as alteration of traditional device structures.\n\n## 2. Materials For High Mobility Oxide-Based Tfts 2.1 Semiconductor Materials (Binary, Ternary, And Multi-Component)\n\nIn this section many active materials for high mobility TFT \napplications have been discussed with respect to composition of binary, ternary and multi-component semiconductor materials. The key binary oxide semiconductors (SnO2, In2O3, Ga2O3 and ZnO) have a wide band gap (>3.0 eV) and high electrical conductivity (10-2 to 102 Ω-1cm-1), which may be attributed due to native defects, such as oxygen vacancies, cation interstitials, substitutional/interstititial hydrogen to act as shallow donors \n[10]. Binary oxides have high electron mobility (>10 cm2/V-s) \nwhen they are amorphous, which originates from the intercalation of the ns orbital of the cations [11]. For these reasons, these oxides have been considered widely as the base materials for oxide-based TFTs. ZnO is the most widely used binary oxide material. Boesen, et al. [12] published in 1968, the first report on TFTs using single crystal ZnO. After a long period, ZnO based TFT research was reelected by other researchers after 2003 [13,14]. \n\nHowever, the high deposition and annealing temperature approaches were still significant problems for low temperature TFT applications. Carcia, et al. fabricated low temperature ZnO TFTs by controlling oxygen partial-pressure of ZnO film growth [14]. Fortunato, et al. [15] reported room temperature fabricated ZnO TFTs with high μFE of ~50 cm2/V-s by carefully optimizing oxygen partial pressure during ZnO growth. The control of oxygen partial pressure suggested a path to the fabrication of highly performance and reliable TFTs. \n\nSeveral research groups have explored SnO2 and In2O3 as channel layers for TFT fabrications. Presley, et al. [16] demonstrated a bottom-gate SnO2 TFT using AlTiOx as the gate insulator, and ITO as the gate, source-drain contacts. The SnO2 channel was deposited by radio frequency (RF) sputtering and then subjected to 600°C in rapid thermal annealing (RTA) treatment. The device performance exhibited a μFE of 2.0 cm2/V-s and an on/off current ratio of 105. However, binary oxide of SnO2 are not suitable compound for making TFTs, owing to its difficulty to achieve at low deposition temperatures, unlike other binary oxide semiconductors. High value of μFE could be achieved for the In2O3 TFTs, which may be attributed to the overlaps of the In 5s orbital [17]. \n\nAs reported in the literatures [18,19] the μFE of In2O3 TFTs is >30 cm2/V-s. However, the high carrier density (Nd) and poor control of defects of In2O3 are the disadvantage as used in AM-OLED applications. On the other hand, Ga2O3 films have high resistivity of \n>108 Ω-cm, presumably due to large density of trap sites and low carrier density, in addition to the large band gap energy (>4 eV), \nwhich results very poor TFT performance, with μFE of 0.05 cm2/\nV-s and turn on voltage (Von) of >10 V [20]. However, binary oxide semiconductors themselves are polycrystalline in nature with poor uniformity [21,22], so they are often unsuitable material for the active channel in TFTs. Ternary, quaternary and or multicomponent oxide materials, in general, allow for considerably higher μFE with better device performance than binary compound devices. Most of the ternary/quaternary oxide materials are amorphous in nature, which can be beneficial for fabricating high performance TFTs. The a-ZnSnO, a-InZnO, a-HfInZnO, aGaInZnO, a-InSnZnO, and a-GaZnSnO are the most prominent ternary/multi component materials for TFT applications [9,2332]. All of these materials exhibit n-type conductivity due to the existence of intrinsic donors. \n\nIn 2005, Oregon State University and Hewlett-Packard reported a high temperature fabrication process of a-ZnSnO TFTs, which exhibited a high μFE of ~50 cm2/V-s [23]. Generally, the carrier concentration and mobility of oxide material increase as the In to Zn ratio increases. The InZnO exhibits a high carrier concentration (>1017 cm-3), which can lead to large-off current and small on/off current ratio [11]. In 2007, Fortunato, et al. [24] reported bottom-gate InZnO TFTs, using a ceramic oxide target with composition of In2O3:ZnO (9:1), achieving a μFE of 107.2 cm2/V-s and large off-current. In 2004, Nomura, et al. proposed another kind of quaternary compound InGaZnO (IGZO) semiconductor [7], which is now most widely used in commercial products [25,33]. \n\nLG display has implemented a 240Hz 55\" UD TV panel using aIGZO TFTs with copper signal lines [33]. One promising composition toward high mobility in quaternary compound materials is the InSnZnO (ITZO) semiconductor. The μFE of ITZO TFT can reach >30 cm2/V-s [28,29,34]. Fukumoto, et al. [28] proposed that the Ga atoms can be replaced by cost-effective Sn atoms in ITZO \nmaterials for TFT application, which has highest μFE of 30.9 cm2/\nV-s with steeper sub-threshold swing at < 210 mV/dec. Also, a high μFE of 52.4 cm2/V-s and low SS of 0.2 V/dec had been observed without a deterioration of the off current, using ITZO for TFT application as reported by Song, et al. [29]. With more than three times the μFE of a-IGZO TFT, ITZO has been found to be the better choice to drive the OLED display panel developments. Recently, AUO demonstrated the 56\" a-ITZO OLED TV [35], which panels achieve a good image quality characteristics, such as wide viewing angle, high contrast ration, and fast response time. \n\n## 2.2 Gate Insulator Materials\n\nSilicon-based dielectric materials (SiO2, SiNx) are widely preferred as gate insulator in most of oxide-based TFTs due to the material abundancy as well as the well-known deposition process i.e. PECVD with a large area of uniform coverage. \n\nWith excellent advantages such as low gate leakage and high stability, the TFTs with SiO2 insulators however have low dielectric constant (κ ~3.9), which requires high operating voltages \n[36]. Reducing power consumption is one of the key issues in development of portable battery-powered appliances (e.g., smartphones, smart watches, etc), due to the limited capacity of the battery life. An effective approach to reduce the power consumption is the use of high-κ dielectric materials and double/\nmultilayer stacked dielectric structures [37,38], which decrease the driving voltage of TFTs. These benefits have been pursued through a variety of transition metal oxide based high-κ gate dielectrics for TFT applications, such as Al2O3, HfO2, ZrO2, or Ta2O5. \n\nWith a large band gap (Eg ~8.8 eV) and a high dielectric constant \n(κ = 9), Al2O3 is a good candidate in oxide-based TFTs, which reduce the interface trap density and an increase in the TFT mobility [39-41]. We have fabricated a-ITZO based TFTs using an Al2O3/SiNx dielectric layer, which exhibited an improved μFE of 26.8 cm2/V-s, while the same device obtained 17.1 cm2/V-s with a traditional SiNx dielectric layer [41]. HfO2 is another high-κ material used in TFT as a dielectric layer because it exhibits a high-κ (~25), Eg ~8.8 eV, and a good conduction/valence-band offset value with Si. Lee, et al. [38] explored high performance aIGZO TFTs that use 200-nm thick HfO2 deposited by RF sputtering system. These devices exhibit very high μFE of 130 cm2/V-s. \n\nStoichiometric ZrO2 is one of the most promising high-κ materials because of its high-κ (~25), high breakdown field intensity \n(~15 MV/cm), relatively low leakage current, and large band gap \n(~5.6 eV). Lee, et al. [42] reported a-IGZO TFT with a high μFE of 28 cm2/V-s at 10 V applied gate voltage using ZrO2 gate dielectric.\n\nHsu, et al. [43] reported a-IGZO based TFTs fabricated at room temperature with high μFE of 76 cm2/V-s using trilayer stacked gate dielectric (SiO2/TiO2/SiO2) structure on flexible substrate. \n\nThe TiO2 has a very high-κ value of >40, which can benefit the driving current and reduce the gate voltage. Liu, et al. [44] reported a-ZITO (amorphous-Zinc Indium Tin Oxide) channel based TFT with a high μFE of 110 cm2/V-s at gate voltage of 1 V \nusing self-assembled nanodielectric. Chiu, et al. [45] used Ta2O5 gate insulators and demonstrated a high μFE of 61.5 cm2/V-s in a-IGZO TFTs fabricated by RF sputtering. Ta2O5 is well-known to have good chemical stability, low optical loss, and high refractive index, which are important in optoelectronic device applications. However, high-κ dielectric has some drawbacks such as large leakage current, high defect states, comparatively low band gap, low stability and polycrystalline structure (most of the high-κ dielectric), which is adverse to TFTs operations.\n\n## 2.3 Source-Drain Electrode Materials\n\nThe influence of source-drain (S-D) electrodes (including materials, contact quality and parasitic resistance) in contact with the semiconductor channel interface has also been a major impact on TFT performance. Proper selection of S-D contact materials is crucial for high performance oxide-based TFTs because parameters such as, μFE, and Vth are dependent on the \n\"contact resistance\" between channel and S-D [46]. When S-D contact resistance are higher, a higher applied bias is required across the S-D to inject carriers into the channel, resulting in current crowding effects causing lower current [47]. In general various metal like Al, Ag, Au, Ni, Ti, Mo, and transparent ITO, IZO electrodes are used in oxide-based TFT devices. Although the ITO and IZO electrodes allow fully transparent TFTs, but large electron affinity of the oxide electrodes cause nonlinear behaviors [48] in the linear regime of output characteristics due to the formation of Schottky like barrier between the electrodes and the a-IGZO films.\n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)\n\nIn oxide-based TFTs, various contact resistance reducing techniques are used like, doped contacts/Ag nanoparticles \n[48,49], plasma treatments [50], and barrier/oxidation-free layers [51]. In general, heavily doped regions below S/D electrodes are adopted to obtain good Ohmic contact properties. Na, et al. \n\n[48] reported a highly conductive (Nd ~1.6×1018 cm3) a-IGZO buffer layer assisted to form a good Ohmic region between a-IGZO \nchannel and Al S-D electrodes, which exhibit an improvement of μFE to 16.6 cm2/V-s from 11.39 cm2/V-s. Similarly, Xu, et al. [49] \nreported the incorporation of Ag nanoparticles at the homojunction interface between the conducting IZO S/D electrodes and the a-IZO channel, consequently a reduction of the specific contact resistance down to ~10-2 Ω.cm2. Park, et al. [50] reported that a-GIZO TFTs with a contact layer modified by Ar plasma treatment, which was reduced contact resistance from 1550 to 330 Ω-cm.\n\nIt is well known that the inter-diffusion of metal atoms into the semiconductor are one of the major drawbacks in the preparation of oxide-based TFTs [51-53]. The inter-diffusion is prevented by the inserting the barrier layer/oxidation-free layer between the S-D and channel layers. Recently, Xu, et al. [54] showed the role of Sn (as an oxidation-free layer) in ZnO and compared the properties with Al, Ti, and Cu. The Al and Ti reacted with oxygen atoms from ZnO to form interfacial layer of ~5 nm thick AlOx and ~3 nm thick TiOx (shown in Fig. 2) between the ZnO and S-D \nlayers. The results indicate that Al electrode with a lower Gibbs free energies induce a thicker interlayer to form. The perfect barrier to prevent the formation of oxidation layers at the metal S-D and oxide interface may be performed by graphene and carbon nanofilms, which offer the high electrical performance and stable TFT devices [55,56].\n\n## 2.4 Doping Materials\n\nDoping in semiconductors is often achieved by introducing \n\n![3_image_0.png](3_image_0.png)\n\nforeign atom (dopants/impurities) into the semiconductor host material. Doping is a unique approach, proposed to increase the μFE and stability of oxide-based TFTs. Generally, the conductivity mechanism of oxide-based materials is associated with oxygen vacancies, which appear to be the origin of the carrier generation center in the performance of oxide-based TFTs. Incorporating various dopants, such as In, C, Al, N, Mg, or Ti, into the oxide-based semiconductors can increase the μFE\nthrough control of the carrier density, which proves its utility in different applications. Serin, et al. [57] showed that conductivity of ZnO may be enhanced due to the incorporation of In dopant. Even the doping approach enhances the electrical properties and devices stability in oxide-based TFTs. The incorporation of In cations to ZnO-based channels is one of best ways to enhance the μFE of the resulting oxide TFTs [58,59]. The In cations provide more conducting pathways for electrons, and hence increase the channel mobility. Hosono, et al. [60] \nexplained the structures and Hall mobility of IGZO films deposited at room temperature as a function of chemical composition (in Fig. 3). The pure ZnO and In2O3 are crystalline phase even when deposited at room temperature. As seen in Fig. 3 aIZO has higher mobilities than a-IGZO films. The increasing In content in the a-IGZO channel of fabricated TFTs yields higher μFE [59], which can be explained by the formation of shallow level oxygen vacancies facilitated by increasing the coordination number of In cations around the oxygen atom. However, the degradation of off-current and Ion/off ratio are observed in the a-IGZO TFT device. This trade-off behavior limits the use of the In fraction to achieve high μFE.\n\nParthiban, et al. [61] fabricated low temperature C-doped IZO (CIZO) TFTs, which exhibited improved μFE of 16.5 cm2/V-s whereas the values for control IZO TFT was 6.55 cm2/V-s. A few research groups are also fabricated In-free oxide-based TFTs, which has high electrical performance. Cai, et al. [62] fabricated Al doped ZnO (AZO) TFTs with high μFE of 143 cm2/V-s and low Vth of 0.9 V. Nitrogen (N) is another excellent dopant in Zn based oxide materials due to its ionic radius and electronegativity, which is close to oxygen, and serve as oxygen-related defects binder. Some reports have highlighted the N-doping approach to enhance the mobility [63,64] and stability [7,65-67] of oxide based TFTs. Similarly, N-doped ZnO of zine oxynitride (ZnON) semiconductor are another promising semiconductor material in high mobility transistor applications. Ye, et al. [68] reported on ZnON TFTs with high μFE of 110 cm2/V-s, demonstrating application in pixel switching devices in ultra-high definition and large area displays. \n\n## 3. Device Structures For High Mobility Oxide-Based Tfts 3.1 Impact Of Device Configuration\n\nThe μFE value and stability are primarily related to the configuration of the oxide-based TFTs. There are four major classes of configurations are used in fabricating the oxide-based TFTs, (i) back channel etch (BCE) structure, (ii) etch stopper (ES) structure, (iii) top gate (TG) structure, and (iv) double gate (DG) structure. Each device configuration has its own advantages and disadvantages. BCE and ES type oxide-based TFTs exhibit good uniformity and stability as well as reasonable μFE. During the S-D \npatterning process of TFT fabrications, physical and/or chemical damage are possible and may degrade the device properties. \n\nTo solve these problems, the ES layer (e.g., SiOx, SiNx) are deposited by a PECVD system under the S-D metal electrodes, but requires an additional patterning process. Both structures have been employed for the mass production of oxide-based TFTs. \n\nHowever, the existence of the ES layer on the oxide semiconductor layer limits the design of short-channel devices due to the misalignment between the S-D to ES or ES to gate. The floating double gate (DG) contact was proposed to modulate the Vth and to increase the μFE [69]. Lee, et al. [70] reported DG a-IGZO TFTs to have considerable attention due to their advantages such as Von, controllability and on-current enhancement. Bottom-gate type structures with a SiOx ES layer have been widely employed for IGZO TFTs [71]. However, one of the serious drawbacks of this structure is a large parasitic capacitance [72] of gate-to-drain and gate to-source due to overlap between gate and S-E electrodes, which also induce poor chemical stability [8].\n\nLarge parasitic capacitance reduces operation speed of the TFT device based circuits and induces signal delay in the TFT backplane. Moreover, large capacitance gate to drain of selection TFTs in OLED display strongly influences uniformity of the luminescence of the pixels because the capacitance gate to drain is the main cause of the kickback effect [73] through voltage which influences an operation voltage of driving TFTs. Therefore, a selfaligned structure is an essential for oxide TFTs to achieve systemon-panel and high-resolution LCD/OLED displays. Self-aligned patterning is another device gaining interest to realize highresolution high-quality displays. Park, et al. [74] reported a high μFE of 157 cm2/V-s in self-aligned coplanar TFTs with a channel layer of a-IZO electrode instead of a-IGZO.\n\n## 3.2 Single And Double-Channel Approaches\n\nAnother approach to enhance the μFE and stability of oxidebased TFTs utilizes the double-channel structures. The double channel structure consisted of back and front layers. The mobility is primarily influenced by the current path boosted at the bottom of the front layer that is adjacent to the gate insulator in bottom-gate structure. Highly conductive (eg. ITO, IZO) and oxygen deficient front layers are mostly preferable to construct the TFT devices. Kim, et al. [75] reported optimized HIZO/IZO TFTs, which exhibited improvement in both the μFE and NBIS stability compared to single channel devices. Hsu, et al. [76] proposed a bilayer IGZO/IGZO:Ti device, which presented the highest μFE of 49 cm2/V-s by modulating the IGZO:Ti thickness. Similarly, the double channel TFTs with a back ZTO/front IZO (5 nm) showed a high μFE of 32.3 cm2/V-s and a low Vth of ~0.5 V [77]. The thickness of IZO (>8 nm) in double channel TFT devices can cause a large negative Von and Vth values. An ITO/IGZO double-channel structure [78] shows excellent TFT properties with a high μFE of 104 cm2/V-s and a low Vth of ~0.5 V. As a result, the mobility of double layer devices can be improved significantly compared to the single active channel devices. In addition, the devices stability are also improved but control of the carrier concentration and thickness of conducting layers remain a challenge. \n\n## 3.3 Nano Materials And Nanostructures\n\nNano materials and nanostructures have been proposed to improve the effective mobility in oxide-based TFTs. By incorporating carbon nanotube (CNT), graphene, nanodots, nanowire and nanocrystalline (nc) metal/ metal oxides into the oxidebased semiconductors, the current path in the channel may be enhanced. Recently, we have reported [79] a high performance hybrid oxide TFTs fabricated using an interlayer of the nc-ITO:Zr and an active channel of a-ITZO. Due to the presence of ncITO:Zr layer, an improvement of μFE of 86.4 cm2/V-s and lower Vth of 0.43 V are observed. Such hybrid TFT devices may be a promising approach for making next generation display panels of the future. Liu, et al. [80] reported a-IZO/single walled-CNT composite TFTs exhibiting a high mobility of 132 cm2/V-s. Similarly, Liu, et al. [81] reported a very high μFE of 140 cm2/V-s in sol-gel a-IZO/\nSW-CNT composite based TFTs (shown in Fig. 4). The reason for the high μFE is the CNTs in the composite channel providing fast carrier movement owing to their electrical properties.\n\nFig. 4. Schematic of the a-IZO/SW-CNT hybrid TFT arrays.

Copyright © 2012 American Chemical Society.\n\nLiu, et al. [82] demonstrated a very high μFE of 174 cm2/V-s in RF sputtered a-IGZO TFTs with silver nanowires into the active region. The schematic of the AgOxNW a-IGZO TFT fabrication steps are depicted in the Fig. 5. Additionally, the composite TFTs also showed exceptional mechanical robustness for flexible applications. Similar to the nanostructure approach, Zan, et al. [83] \nproposed a top-gate self-aligned a-IGZO TFT with nanometerscale dotted channel doping. With a low-cost, simple, and lithography-free process, the effective mobility level of TG a-IGZO TFT \nbecame 19 times higher than that of the control sample and the maximum effective mobility reached 79 cm2/V-s due to barrier lowering effect. \n\n## 4. Conclusions\n\nOxide-based TFTs have an optimistic future for the application in commercial high-resolution FPDs. We reviewed the different approaches of improving the field-effect mobility of oxide-based thin film transistors. The various approaches, including the selection of materials for semiconductor, dielectric, electrode materials and device structures for realizing high mobility oxidebased TFT devices are discussed. Oxide-based TFTs have an optimistic future for the application of commercial high-resolution FPDs. In this review paper, a detailed discussion on the different aspects of TFTs will directed to fabricate a high quality TFT devices. \n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported by the Business for Cooperative R&D \nbetween Industry, Academy, and Research Institute funded by the Korea Small and Medium Business Administration in 2015 \n(Grant No. C0300055) and by the Human Resources Development program (Grant No. 20144030200580) of the Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP) grant funded by the Korea government Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy.\n\n## References\n\n[1] P.

Introduction\n\nMetal oxide semiconductor thin-film transistors (TFTs), especially indium–gallium–zinc–oxide (IGZO)-based TFTs, have received considerable interest since Nomura et al. reported the first amorphous IGZO (a-IGZO) based TFT in 2004. Before the invention of the first a-IGZO-based TFT, the crystalline IGZO\nmaterials were first reported as early as 1985[1]. However, it was not until 2003 and 2004 that Nomura et al. used the IGZO materials of single-crystalline and amorphous states as the TFT semiconductor channel materials, respectively[2, 3].\n\nThe key advantage of single-crystalline is that there are no defects or grain boundaries, which makes TFTs with ultra-high mobility. However, a high temperature is needed for single crystal growth, which is not favorable for large-area application. In 2004, Nomura et al. reported that a-IGZO film can be deposited at low temperature. Now, a-IGZO films have become the most common TFT channel semiconductor materials. Compared to amorphous silicon TFTs with a field-effect mobility lower than 1.0 cm2/(V·s), a-IGZO-based TFTs usually show a field-effect mobility higher than 10 cm2/(V·s)[4−7].\n\nSeveral well-known display companies (e.g., Sharp, Samsung Electronics, and LG Electronics) have demonstrated that IGZO-based TFTs have many potential applications in liquid crystal displays (LCDs), organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs)\ndisplay and electronic paper displays[7−14]. In addition to flat panel displays, IGZO-based TFTs are also actively involved in sensor applications and neuromorphic systems. IGZO-based TFTs have the key advantages of distinguishable sensitivities to light, pressure, pH, gas, and some other parameters, which meet the requirements of these sensors. Furthermore, based on the relatively mature display technology, sensors with IGZO-based TFTs are easier to manufacture[15−30]. In particular, the IGZO-based TFTs show great potential in the field of flexible electronics because of their unique advantages of lightweight, ultrathin thickness and resistance to mechanical bending[13, 31−33]. IGZO-based TFTs with electrolyte gate dielectrics are very favorable for artificial synapse/neuron emulation, due to the interfacial electric-double-layer coupling and electrochemical doping effects[34−41]. IGZO-based TFTs neuromorphic devices show very low-energy consumption down to pJ/spike because of the extremely high gate capacitance of the electrolyte gate dielectrics and the high resistance of IGZO channel layers[42−45]. Some important applications of IGZO-based TFTs are shown in Fig. 1.\n\nWith the rapid development of IGZO-based TFTs in various aspects of our life, especially in the field of display, a large number of studies based on the IGZO-based TFTs have been reported. Thus, this article aims to review the recent progress and the major trends in the field of IGZO-based TFTs. In this paper, we review the materials, devices and applications of IGZO-based TFTs. First, the history, electron travelling orbitals and deposition methods of the IGZO thin film are introduced. Second, we introduce the traditional devices and the new-concept device structures. Third, we comprehensively discuss the main applications, including display drivers, sensor applications and neuromorphic systems using IGZObased TFTs. Finally, our conclusions and the outlook for IGZO-based TFTs are discussed.\n\n## 2.  Igzo Materials And Tfts\n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)\n\nzuka et al. in 1985[1]. These authors successfully fabricated InGaZnO4 with YbFe2O4-type structure by sintering at a temperature above 1000 °C. Until 2003 and 2004, the single-crystalline and amorphous state IGZO materials were proposed for TFT channel semiconductors by Nomura et al.\n\n[2, 3], respectively. In 2003, Nomura et al. presented a transparent TFT with single-crystalline IGZO thin film as the channel layer. The unique advantages of the single-crystalline InGaO3(ZnO)5thin film are that there are no grain boundaries and defects, which enable the single-crystalline IGZO-based TFT to show a field-effect mobility (μFE) as high as ~80 cm2/(V·s). However, a high annealing temperature of 1400 °C was needed to form the single-crystalline phase. This high temperature process limited the practical application. In the next year, amorphous IGZO (a-IGZO) thin films were deposited at low temperature by Nomura et al.\n\n[3]. This a-IGZO thin film was prepared by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) using a polycrystalline InGaZnO4 ceramic target. The first a-IGZO-based TFT showed a saturation mobility of 6–9 cm2/(V·s), a current on/off ratio (Ion/Ioff) of 103 and threshold voltage (Vth) of 1.6 V.\n\nThe electron travelling orbitals of oxide semiconductors are different from covalent semiconductors. Covalent semiconductors (e.g., silicon) possess carrier transport paths of directive sp3 orbitals[3]. Thus, the electron mobility of single crystal silicon can reach up to 1000 cm2/(V·s)[38]. However, if the carrier conducting pathway was disrupted in the case that the crystalline structure was broken or under amorphous state, then the carrier mobility would be lower by three orders of magnitude than single crystal silicon[39]. Unlike covalent semiconductors, oxide semiconductors are of degenerate band conduction. Fig. 2 shows the carrier transport paths of crystalline and amorphous oxide semiconductors. The carrier transport paths of metal oxide semiconductors are composed of spatial metal ns orbitals with isotropic shape. Because s orbital is of spherical symmetric, the overlap in distorted metal–oxygen–metal can also offer a conductor pathway.\n\nMany methods have been proposed to deposit IGZO thin films. The most commonly used method is sputtering becau-\n\n![2_image_1.png](2_image_1.png)\n\nse it is compatible with uniform deposition on the large surface with low cost[40, 41, 49]. Pulsed laser deposition (PLD)[3],\natomic layer deposition(ALD)[50−52], plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD)[53−55] and solution methods such as spin-coating, inkjet printing and gravure printing[56] are also used for IGZO-based TFT fabrication. These methods possess unique advantages, for example, IGZO thin film grown by ALD showed a roughness at the atomic level. The PECVD method can well control the reactive species concentration and further regulate the film deposition rate.\n\n## 2.2.  Igzo-Based Tfts\n\nThe first concept of thin-film transistors (TFTs) was patented as early as the 1930s[57]. However, TFTs were only at the concept stage without vacuum technology and an understanding of semiconductors. The first practical TFT was fabricated in 1962 by Weimer[58]. In his experiment, microcrystalline cadmium sulfide film was used as the semiconducting channel layer and silicon oxide was used as the gate dielectric. Since 2003, zinc oxide (ZnO) TFTs have attracted much interest[59−61]. However, ZnO films crystallize at low temperature and usually show polycrystalline structure, which is not suitable for large-area macroelectronics. Fortunately, Nomura et al. invented the first a-IGZO-based TFT in 2004[3]. IGZObased TFTs have gradually gained practical applications thanks to their high electrical performance, large-area uniformity, and low processing temperature. Fig. 3 shows a time axis diagram of the development of the IGZO-based TFTs.\n\nMany possible device structures for IGZO-based TFTs are shown in Fig. 4[63, 64]. Figs. 4(a)–4(e) show the bottom-gate structure, top-gate structure, dual-gate structure, vertical structure and multiple gate structure, respectively. Figs. 4(a) and 4(b) are the simplest device structures that require very few manufacturing steps, which are very friendly to the laboratory device preparation. For example, the structure in Fig. 4(a)\njust needs one lithographic step, which makes the device preparation relatively quick and cheap. However, the electrical properties of those devices are unstable because the channel materials are exposed to the atmosphere, and will be influenced by the moisture and oxygen in the air. In the dual-gate structure, just as the name implies, bottom gate and top gate are together used to control the device properties, such as the threshold voltage, subthreshold swing, current on/off ratio[65−68]. The devices of vertical structure possess small footprint, resistance to the bending stress and controllable channel length[69−71]. TFTs of multiple in-plane gate electrodes are used in neuro-transistors to simulate spatiotemporal information processing[72].\n\nIn IGZO-based TFTs, source/drain electrodes, gate elec-\n\n![3_image_0.png](3_image_0.png)\n\n![3_image_1.png](3_image_1.png)\n\ntrode, gate dielectric and IGZO semiconductor channel material are used in the TFT structures. Electrodes are usually composed of metal materials, high conductive metal oxides and new materials such as graphene[70, 73, 74]. Various materials are used as gate dielectrics. First, traditional gate dielectrics like SiO2 and SiOx\n[66, 75], which can be compatible with traditional TFT fabrication process. Second, high κ materials, such as Al2O3, HfO2, ZrO2, Y2O3 and Ta2O5\n[50, 70, 76]. The advantages of these materials are that they can reduce the equivalent oxide thickness and decrease the device size. However, they are of poor interface quality and reduce compatibility with the TFT fabrication process. Third, organic gate dielectrics such as olefin polymers and polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP)[77, 78]. These organic gate dielectrics are usually used in the flexible electrics.\n\nFinally, ion gate dielectrics, such as proton conducting nanogranular SiO2 and chitosan[79, 80]. These dielectrics are actively used in the electric-double-layer TFTs and produce a large capacitance.\n\nSato et al. presented a bottom-gate type coplanar homojunction a-IGZO-based TFT[75]. In this work, they employed highly doped contact regions naturally formed by depositing upper protection layers made of hydrogenated silicon nitride.\n\nAs a result, a nearly ideal Ohmic contact was formed with a low parasitic source-to-drain resistance of 34 Ω·cm. Fig. 5(a) shows a schematic diagram of the TFT structure. The device was fabricated on a glass substrate. The molybdenum (Mo) layer was sputtered as the bottom-gate electrode. The SiOx layer was deposited by PECVD as the gate dielectric. This gate dielectric material is commonly used because it is compatible with the traditional TFT fabrication process. Then, the a-IGZO semiconductor film was deposited by direct-current magnetron sputtering and used as channel layer at room temperature. SiOx\n/SiNx layer was deposited by PECVD and used as a protection layer. The region that was not covered SiOx after depositing SiOx\n/SiNx film was converted to highly conductive source/drain electrodes. Figs. 5(b) and 5(c) show the transfer and output curves of the TFTs, respectively. The device showed a good subthreshold swing (SS) of 0.13 V/decade, a Vth of 0.13 V, and an Ion/Ioff of over 109 at Vds = 10 V. From the output characteristics, we can see a steep rise in the low Vds region, which indicated a good Ohmic contact between semiconductive a-IGZO and source/drain electrode.\n\nZhang et al. proposed a self-aligned top-gate a-IGZObased TFT with a thickness of 8.62 nm SiO2 as gate dielec-\n\n![4_image_0.png](4_image_0.png) \n\n![4_image_1.png](4_image_1.png)\n\ntric[74]. This device realized the ultrathin gate dielectric less than 10 nm with low leakage current. Fig. 6(a) shows the structure of the TFT and the major processing steps, respectively.\n\nA thickness of 40 nm a-IGZO thin film was deposited on the glass substrate by sputtering at room temperature. A thin SiO2film with thickness lower than 10 nm was deposited as the gate dielectric by PECVD at 300 °C. The 80 nm thick Mo film was then deposited on the SiO2layer and patterned to form the gate electrode by dry etching. Finally, the Mo layer was used as the source/drain electrodes by a lift-off process.\n\nFigs. 6(b) and 6(c) show the transfer and output characteristics of the a-IGZO-based TFT, respectively. The a-IGZO-based TFT showed a low off-state current of less than 10–12 A, a low gate leakage current of 10–13 A, a μFE of 10.13 cm2/(V·s), a Vth of 0.52 V and a high Ion/Ioff over 108 at Vds = 2.1 V. Such a-IGZO TFTs with ultrathin SiO2 gate dielectric have achieved a low gate leakage current and have also shown a good electrical stability under positive and negative gate bias stresses.\n\nIn the dual-gate structure, the top gate and bottom gate are together used to modulate the channel carrier concentration and further control the electrical performance of the device, such as the turn-on voltage, the threshold voltage and the field-effect mobility, through applying voltage to the bottom and top-gate electrodes[81−84]. The work principle of dual-gate TFT is somewhat like that of the single-gate TFT, utilizing the electric field capacitively to control the channel. By changing the polarity or amplitude of the voltage applied to the bottom or the top gate, the channel actually becomes enhanced or depleted. The concentration of the conductive carriers (the majority carriers) changes and the electrical performance of the device can also be modulated. Li et al. presented a comparison between the single-gate and dual-gate TFTs[66].\n\n![5_image_0.png](5_image_0.png)\n\nFigs. 7(a) and 7(b) show the schematic structures of the single-gate and dual-gate devices, respectively. The a-IGZO\nthin film was deposited as the channel layer by reactive sputtering. Figs. 7(c) and 7(d) show the transfer and output curves of the single-gate TFT, respectively. Figs. 7(e) and 7(f)\nshow the transfer and output curves of the dual-gate TFT, respectively. Compared with the single-gate TFT, the performance of the dual-gate TFT is more superior. The on current was 2.54 times higher than that of the single-gate TFT, the μFE was about 1.23 times higher than that of the single-gate TFT, and SS was about half of the single-gate TFT.\n\nVertical structure devices can offer ultrashort channel with high current. Furthermore, the ultrashort channel enables the device to resist mechanical stress, which is especially important for flexible devices[70]. In planar IGZO-based TFTs, a few cracks in the IGZO thin film can severely degrade the migration of the carriers. However, in vertical structures, the vertical current is unaffected by planar cracks. When the device suffers an external mechanical stress, usually causing several cracks across the IGZO thin film, as shown in Fig. 8(d), the TFTs in the vertical structure are less affected because the current transfer between the source and drain is in the vertical direction. Liu et al. presented a highly flexible vertical TFT\nwith the IGZO thin film as the channel layer[70]. Fig. 8 shows the vertical device structure and the charge transport paths in the planar and vertical TFTs, respectively. The structure of the vertical TFTs is based on the vertical heterostructure of graphene-IGZO-metal stack. Tanium (Ti) was sputtered as the drain electrode. The IGZO thin film was deposited as the channel layer. The chemical vapor deposition (CVD) graphene was transferred onto the IGZO thin film as the source electrode. A\nthickness of 40 nm Al2O3thin film was deposited on the top of the channel as the gate dielectric with high dielectric constant. When the cracks appeared in the IGZO thin film, as shown in Figs. 8(c) and 8(d), the carriers cannot be transported in the planar structure because the source/drain electrodes are both in the same plane and the current is blocked by the cracks. However, as shown in Figs. 8(a) and 8(b), the sou-\n\n![6_image_0.png](6_image_0.png)\n\n![6_image_1.png](6_image_1.png)\n\nrce/drain electrode and gate electrode are in the vertical direction, and thus the carrier transfer are less affected. Based on the characteristics of the resistance to mechanical stress, these vertical structure TFTs are significantly favorable for the application of flexible electronics.\n\nIn 2017, IGZO-based neuron TFTs with multiple in-plane gate electrodes were reported by our group[72]. Fig. 9 shows the device structure of the neuron TFTs gated by a nanogranular SiO2 electrolyte film. Electric-double-layer effect due to the mobile proton in the SiO2 electrolyte film provided a very large specific gate capacitance. Voltage pulses applied on the in-plane gate electrodes can be temporally and spatially coupled to the IGZO channel layer due to the indium–zinc–oxide (IZO) floating gate. These IGZO-based neuron TFTs are favorable for sensors and neuromorphic applications.\n\n## 3.  Applications\n\nIGZO-based TFTs have been applied in many areas, such as display drivers, sensors and neuromorphic systems[10, 23, 25, 85−88]. In this section, we will introduce the important applications based on IGZO-based TFTs in commercial production and scientific research.\n\n## 3.1.  Display Drivers\n\nHydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) and low-temperature polysilicon (LTPS) have been widely used in practical displays. However, the electron mobility of a-Si:H is usually low (1.0 cm2/(V·s)) and the TFTs are unstable under stress and illumination[4]. LTPS TFTs possess high mobility and good stability compared to a-Si:H TFTs[11]. Nevertheless, the process cost of preparing LTPS films is relatively high, especially for large-size displays[4, 5, 85, 89]. In addition to these two materials, the IGZO thin film has the advantages of high electron mobility, low-temperature fabrication process, high uniformity of large area and low cost. These advantages ensure that the IGZO-based TFTs are favorable for the applications of displays[9, 11−13, 31, 41, 85, 90−103].\n\n## 3.1.1. Lcds\n\nLCDs are a relatively mature technology and are used in display panels, such as smart phone displays, tablet personal computers and televisions. The trends of LCDs are high resolution (7680 × 4320 pixels), ultra-high pixel density of over 300ppi (pixels per inch) and refresh rate of 240 Hz or higher. To follow these trends, smaller and faster TFTs are required. Consequently, a-IGZO-based TFTs are considered as an advanced method to achieve the high pixel density on a large panel size, due to their high mobility and small size. For example, Baek et al. reported a dual-gate synchronized a-IGZO-based TFT for the application of an active-matrix liquid crystal display (AMLCD)[91]. To understand the operation principle of the dual-gate a-IGZO-based TFT under synchronized bias conditions, a mathematical analysis of the dual-gate synchronized a-IGZO-based TFT is analyzed in this work. The equation of current in saturation region is IDS = WμC(VGS - VTH)\n2/2L,\nand the equation of subthreshold swing is SS = (∂ log10IDS/\n∂ VGS)\n–1, where W and L are the channel width and length, C\nis the capacitance of the channel semiconductor, and μ is field-effect mobility. Compared with the top-gate, bottomgate, and synchronized dual-gate a-IGZO TFTs only by bias conditions, from the calculations, the dual-gate a-IGZO-based TFTs under synchronized bias produced larger current and steeper SS compared to the single-gate TFTs with the same channel width/length ratio. These superior properties of the a-IGZO-based TFTs allow the AMLCD to have high pixel density and high resolution. Fig. 10 shows the proposed pixel circuit with the synchronized dual-gate a-IGZO-based TFT for the AMLCD. In the pixel, the switching transistor (a-IGZObased TFT) was of an inverted staggered structure with an additional gate electrode (top gate). Furthermore, the top gate and the bottom gate were tied together through the sync via, which prevented the dual-gate TFTs from suffering the degradations of the mobility and subthreshold swing. These aIGZO-based TFTs achieved a smaller size for the same amplitude of drain current.\n\n## 3.1.2. Oleds\n\nOLEDs driven by a-IGZO-based TFTs are still in the development stage and they have not been put into the display market on a large scale. For further development, crucial problems such as device stability, imaging uniformity and yield[104−108] need to be solved urgently. For example, the threshold voltage of the a-IGZO-based TFT usually shifts under electrical bias stress[108], which would cause non-uniform brightness in the OLED displays. Fortunately, TFTs with dualgate structure can control the threshold voltage with little vari-\n\n![7_image_0.png](7_image_0.png)\n\n![7_image_1.png](7_image_1.png)\n\nation[101]. Wang et al. reported a dual-gate a-IGZO-based TFTdriven pixel circuit for active-matrix OLEDs (AMOLEDs)[101].\n\nFigs. 11(a) and 11(b) show schematic diagram and the electrode definition of the dual-gate TFT structure, respectively. The bottom gate and the top gate were defined as the primary gate and the auxiliary gate, respectively. The threshold voltage of the dual-gate TFT under the primary gate operation can be modulated by the auxiliary gate voltage. Fig. 11(c) shows the transfer curves of the dual-gate a-IGZO-based TFTs under the primary gate operation with auxiliary gate voltage changing from –4 to 4 V. As shown in Fig. 11(d), the threshold voltage shifted linearly with the auxiliary gate voltage. Therefore, the Vth variation under the primary gate operation could be compensated by varying auxiliary gate voltage. Fig. 11(e) shows a schematic of the pixel circuit including one driving TFT (T1), four switching\n\n## Tfts (T2–T5) And Two Capacitors (C1 And C2). 3.1.3. Flexible Displays\n\nFlexible IGZO-based TFTs are capable for use as flexible displays, due to the unique advantages such as light-weight substrates[87, 109−112], low-voltage-driven[113], and bendability[114, 115]. In addition, when the IGZO thin films are deposited on to suitable substrates, the IGZO-based TFTs can be used to form fully transparent flexible displays. Flexible displays driven by IGZO-based TFTs have been researched in many works[13, 31, 34, 116]. For example, in 2009, Park et al. fabricated a 6.5 inch full-color flexible AMOLED on the polyimide\n(PI) substrate driven by a-IGZO-based TFTs[13]. The a-IGZObased TFT showed a Vth of 0.9 V, an SS of 0.25 V/dec, a μFE of 15.1 cm2/(V·s). Moreover, there was no performance degradation under bending of the R = 3 mm. Nag et al. presented a top-emitting quarter-quarter-video-graphics-array AMOLED display with 85-ppi resolution driven by a-IGZO-based TFTs[31]. In this display panel, the driven a-IGZO-based TFT\nshowed high electronic characteristics of μFE of 12.0 cm2/(V·s), SS of 0.5 V/dec, and Ion/Ioff of over 107.\n\nMost TFT gate drivers integrated on the display panel use carry signals between the stages. However, in the flexible display the error of the stressed stages is accumulated through the carry signals when the display panel is bent. This problem will probably lead to the failure of the image refresh. To deal with this problem, Kim et al. reported a carryfree gate driver for flexible displays using a-IGZO-based TFTs[117]. This carry-free gate driver overcame that problem because it did not use the carry signals and each unit stage operated independently. Fig. 12(a) shows the conceptual architecture and the output waveforms of the carry-free gate driver.\n\nEach unit stage works as a decoder and the output of each stage is decided by the binary-weighted decoder signals. When the mechanical stress is applied, the outputs of the stressed stages would become slower but the errors could not accumulate because there are no carry signals through which the error can propagate and each stage works independently. As shown in Fig. 12(b), the flexible display with a carryfree gate driver can keep the normal operation, even under the mechanical stress. Moreover, the carry-free gate driver showed no voltage fluctuation at the outputs after 10 000 cycles bending test with a bending radius of 2 mm. These carry-free gate drivers achieve high reliability under mechanical stress compared with the traditional carry-type gate drivers for flexible displays.\n\nTable 1 shows the recent studies of the display applications driven by the a-IGZO-based TFTs. This table shows the substrate, structure, electrical properties of the a-IGZO-based TFTs, the size of the display panel and the specific application. Nowadays, a-IGZO-based TFTs have attracted considerable attention thanks to their large-size, high-resolution and narrow-bezel display applications. Fig. 13 shows this progress in display applications. For example, China Star Optoelectronics Technology (CSOT) developed an 85-inch 8k4k LCD\ndriven by the IGZO-based TFTs. The large-size LCD panel is shown in Fig. 13(a)[121]. Fig. 13(b) shows a 1058-ppi ultrahigh-resolution flexible OLED display using IGZO-based TFTs fabricated by Semiconductor Energy Laboratory[62]. Usually, in the display market, displays with a pixel of about 400-ppi\n\n![8_image_0.png](8_image_0.png)\n\nare used. This OLED display showed an ultra-high resolution of 1058-ppi with c-axis-aligned nanocrystalline IGZO materials and could be used for mass production. LG Display demonstrated a bezel free designed AMOLED driven by a-IGZObased TFTs in 2019[122]. Fig. 13(c) shows an image of the panel. In the fabrication process, this panel is designed to be bezel free. The small remaining bezel of 0.x mm is shown in Fig. 13(c), due to the panel cutting process from the mother glass. We believe that in the future displays driven by the IGZO-based TFTs will gradually occupy a dominant position not only in the field of LCD or OELD but also in the field of true flexible displays.\n\n## 3.2.  Sensor Applications\n\nSensors can detect the light, force, voice, gas, humidity et al. and transfer them into electrical signal. At present, sensors have been applied in industrial manufacture, healthcare monitoring[123], food safety[124], artificial electronic skins and so on. IGZO-based TFTs are compatible with semiconductor integrated circuit technology and they possess the advantages of small size, room-temperature fabrication process and sensitivity to the pH, pressure, light, gas and so on[16, 20, 22, 23, 25, 125−128], which meet with the requirements of the sensors. In this section, we will present the main sensor applications based on the IGZO-based TFTs.\n\n## 3.2.1. Photodetectors\n\nPhotodetectors have attracted increasing attention, due to their wide applications in biomedicine, fire monitoring, Table 1. Display applications of the IGZO-based TFTs.\n\nSubstrate Structure of the TFT μFE (cm2/(V·s)) Vth (V) SS (V/dec) Size (inch) Application Ref.\n\nGlass Dual-gate 11 0.24 130 55 LCD [118] Glass Inverted stagger 9 - — 32 LCD [48] Glass Bottom gate 15 3.2 0.4 80 LCD [104] Glass Inverted bottom gate 4.2±0.4 –1.3 0.96±0.1 15 AMLCD [12] Glass Back channel etch 7.35 1.6 - — AMLED [100] Glass Staggered bottom gate 8.2 1.1 0.58 12.1 AMOLED [11] - — 18.45 1.04 0.73 - AMOLED [97] Glass Etch stopper 20 - — 4.8 AMOLED [103] Polyimide Staggered bottom gate 17.3 0.86 0.21 11.7 Flexible AMOLED [119] Polyimide Inverted staggered bottom gate 11.6 1.6 0.25 3 Flexible AMOLED [34] Polyimide Coplanar 10.25 0.34 0.22 - Flexible OLED [120]\n\n![9_image_0.png](9_image_0.png)\n\nphoto-communication, missile plume detection and so on.\n\nThe photodetectors based on the IGZO-based TFTs exhibit a relatively high response to light with a wavelength lower than 420 nm because the IGZO materials possess a wide bandgap over 3.0 eV. For example, Yu et al. presented an ultraviolet (UV) photodetector based on the IGZO-based TFT with a p–n junction[27]. Fig. 14 shows a schematic diagram of the IGZObased TFT structure, the carrier transmission process under the light and the photo responsivity of the IGZO and PEDOT:PSS/SnOx\n/IGZO TFTs, respectively. The p–n junction was composed of the PEDOT:PSS/SnOx\n/IGZO heterojunction structure. Through the p–n junction, the directional carrier transfer of the photo-generated carriers was experimentally validated. A photo responsivity of 984 A/W at a wavelength of 320 nm was obtained in this work. This work has successfully fabricated a visible-blind ultraviolet photodetector based on the a-IGZO TFTs and achieved ultra-low-power dissipation of lower than 10 nW under illumination and about 0.2 pW in the dark. Moreover, this photodetector with high photoresponsivity has the unique advantage of pixel integration, which can potentially be applied in high performance visibleblind ultraviolet photodetector pixel arrays. Besides the UV\nphotoelectric sensors, the IGZO-based TFTs with narrowbandgap materials such as graphene dots[129], silver nanoparticles[130] and polymer[131] have successfully been used in visible-light photoelectric sensors. For example, in 2010, Zan et al. demonstrated a visible-light phototransistor that consisted of a wide-bandgap a-IGZO and a narrow-bandgap\n(about 2 V) poly (3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)[131]. The a-IGZO\nthin film and P3HT formed a p–n junction diode. The P3HT layer has a high absorption coefficient for visible light and absolutely absorbs visible light, and consequently injects electrons into the a-IGZO layer. As a result, the concentration of the carriers in the channel and also the threshold voltage of the a-IGZO-based TFT change rapidly with the illumination. In this work, the authors proposed a simple way to convert a wide-bandgap a-IGZO-based TFT into a visible-light photodetector that has a fast response and a high sensitivity. Although ultraviolet and visible-light phototransistors have been fabricated in many works, there are few reports of infrared photodetectors based on IGZO TFTs. Lee et al. for the first time characterized the infrared photoresponse principle through the subgap density-of-states over the forbidden bandgap of a-IGZO[26]. The origin of the sub-bandgap (hν <\nEg) photo response in a-IGZO-based TFTs was that the electrons were optically pumped from the photo-responsive subbandgap states. From these works, we can see that the photodetectors based on the IGZO-based TFTs have been investigated from ultraviolet to infrared. These works provide useful results that can help the integration of the photodetectors based on the IGZO-based TFTs.\n\n## 3.2.2. Pressure Sensors\n\nPressure sensors are used to monitor pressure magnitude and fluctuation, which are important in areas such as blood flow, heartbeat, and respiratory system of the human body[132]. Piezoelectric sensors have attracted much attention because they can generate an electric potential in response to an applied pressure. Geng et al. proposed a pressure sensor based on a dual-gate a-IGZO-based TFT with a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) piezo-capacitor[133]. When the pressure is applied by finger pressing, the potential of the top-gate will change, thus the threshold voltage of the a-IGZO TFT shifts, which will produce an obvious output signal in the range of 200–300 mV. Fig. 15(a) shows the structure of a dual-gate a-IGZO-based TFT with a piezo-capacitor. The unique advantage of the double gate structure is that the electrical characteristics of the TFT can be simultaneously controlled both by the bottom gate and top gate. In this structure, the piezo-capacitor was formed on the top of a floating top gate. The piezo-capacitor was polarized and generated a voltage to the top gate when it was pressed. Fig. 15(b) shows the transfer curves of the dual-gate a-IGZO-based TFT. From the curves, the Vth of the dual-gate a-IGZO-based TFTs shifted to the positive bottom-gate voltage direction by applying negative top-gate voltage, and to the negative bottom-\n\n![10_image_0.png](10_image_0.png)\n\n![10_image_1.png](10_image_1.png)\n\n![10_image_2.png](10_image_2.png)\n\ngate voltage direction by applying a positive top-gate voltage. Moreover, the Vth would return to its initial value after removing the top-gate voltage. This change of the Vth with different top-gate voltage is the mechanism of the pressure sensors. This work has realized a pressure sensor using piezocapacitor that integrated with dual-gate a-IGZO-based TFTs.\n\n3.2.3. pH sensors Biosensors have attracted considerable interest for disease diagnosis and the pursuit of a better life. In particular, pH sensors play an important role in clinical medicine, environmental monitoring, agriculture and food engineering[18, 134, 135]. IGZO-based TFTs possess the advantages of compatibility with flexible substrates, chemical/electrical stability and micro/nano size, which are satisfied with the pH\nsensors[19, 136]. For example, Smith et al. presented a flexible extended-gate ion-sensitive field-effect transistor (ISFET)\nbiosensor based on the IGZO-based TFTs using LED technology[19]. The ISFETs are well used as pH sensitive biosensors with different dielectrics such as SnO2\n[136], TiO2\n[126] and ITO[19]\nas the pH sensitive layers[18, 125]. In this work, the ISFET drain current was increased as the pH decreased, which was due to the H+ ion protonation of the ITO extended-gate electrode surface. When the H+ concentration increased around the surface of the ITO gate electrode, negative charge carriers in the channel were generated thanks to the increased positive charge at the ITO/IGZO interface with decreasing pH value, resulting in the increase of the drain current. Fig. 16(a) shows the structure of a flexible ISFET pH sensor. In this structure, a\n\n![10_image_3.png](10_image_3.png)\n\nFig. 16. (Color online) (a) Structure of the flexible extended-gate ISFET\npH sensor. (b) Data graph of the drain current vs time[19].\n\n![11_image_0.png](11_image_0.png)\n\n![11_image_1.png](11_image_1.png)\n\nflexible 125 μm thick polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) plastic was used as the substrate. The top 1 × 3 mm2indium tin oxide (ITO) layer was used as the extended gate to detect the pH value. A width/length = 9/9 μm IGZO layer was used as the n-channel. Fig. 16(b) shows the graph of the ISFET drain current vs time. A sequence of pH 4→ pH 7 → pH 10 → pH\n7 → pH 4 with the interval of 400 s for each pH concentration was used to test the current. The current was tested from 0 to 10 s, 200 to 210 s, 400 to 410 s. As the pH concentration increased from pH 4 to pH 10, the drain current decreased because of the decrease of the H+ ion protonation in the ITO extended-gate electrode surface. These results of sensors fabricated on a flexible substrate demonstrate the initial possibility of directly using the flexible LED technology to produce low cost, good performance and flexible IGZO TFTbased biosensors.\n\n## 3.2.4. Gas Sensors\n\nGas sensors based on IGZO-based TFTs are used to detect both oxidizing and reducing gases (like NO2 and H2)\n[29, 137−139]. Oxidizing or reducing gas molecules act like electron acceptors or donors to change the carrier concentration, respectively, and thus change the drain current of the IGZObased TFTs[30]. For example, Lee et al. reported a H2 sensor using the IGZO-based TFTs[138]. Palladium (Pd) was used as source/drain electrodes and also used to detect hydrogen\n(H2) gas concentration. The drain current increased as the Pd and IGZO interface barrier height decreased, which happened because of the formation of a hydrogen dipole layer at the interface[139]. To sense the reducing gas, Kim et al.\n\npresented a low-concentration NO2 gas detector. The a-IGZO\nthin film was used both as a channel and as a sensing layer[137]. Fig. 17 shows the device structure, transfer curves under 50 ppm NO2 gas concentration with different times, and the drain current change as a function of the exposure time, respectively. The threshold voltage positive shifted with an oxidation reaction in the NO2 gas, NO2(gas) + e–(surface of oxide) → NO2(adsorbed). In particular, the sensing data was accurately obtained from the variation of the drain current and this sensor achieved efficient detection of the variation of the NO2 concentration. Thus, a-IGZO TFT-based gas sensors show good responsivity, sensitivity and recovery from the low concentration of the NO2 gas.\n\n## 3.2.5. Flexible Sensors\n\nIGZO-based TFT sensors have been widely used in flexible light detectors, pH sensors, gas detectors, and so on[19, 22, 33, 140]. For example, Xin et al. presented a novel pressure-sensing system using an a-IGZO-based TFT configuration comprised of a microstructured polydimethylsiloxane\n(PDMS) capacitor[22]. Fig. 18 shows the structures and the output curves, respectively. This array was fabricated on a highly flexible PI substrate using the back channel etch structure. The mechanism of the device can be explained by the change of the capacitance of the microstructured PDMS under an external pressure to modulate the gate voltage and change the output drain current. This device shows sufficient sensitivity to detect pressure difference under extremely low-pressure regime. The microstructure PDMS thin film showed good sensitivity of 0.1 kPa–1 and response time\n\n| Table 2.

According to the amplification effect of the a-IGZO-based TFT, the device showed a high sensitivity in the subthreshold region for the ultra-low-pressure (≤ 1.5 kPa) detection and good linearity in the linear region for low-pressure (≤ 7 kPa) detection. The results demonstrated that a novel approach can be used for pressure-sensing intelligent products.\n\nFlexible IGZO-based TFTs are especially capable for use as flexible circuits, such as oscillators, inverters, radio frequency identifications, operational amplifiers and clock generators[87, 141−143]. Thus, flexible sensors provided by flexible circuits have aroused a great deal of interest[47, 144]. For example, Meister et al. reported a low-power low-frequency light-sensing oscillator with IGZO-based TFTs that were integrated on a bendable plastic substrate[47]. This oscillator could be directly used as a light sensor without additional read out circuits. The device oscillated between 5 Hz in the dark and 31 Hz under daylight. The light-sensitivity of the oscillation frequency is between 7.4 Hz/klx in the dark and about 1.7 Hz/klx in the daylight. In particular, this device had a low frequency of 5–31 Hz and low power of 188 μW. Significantly, this work achieved a low-power consumption, flexible integrated circuit that can be directly used to sense the light intensity through the frequency of the oscillation in a small chip area.\n\nTable 2 shows the recent studies of the sensor applications based on the IGZO-based TFTs. This table shows the substrate, structure, electrical properties and the specific sensor applications of the IGZO-based TFTs.\n\n## 3.3.  Neuromorphic Systems\n\nTraditional computers based on von Neumann architectures play essential roles in almost every field and have led to the development of information technology. However, there are two main problems that hinder the further improvement of computing power: the first is the limitation on energy efficiency as we approach the end of the Moore's law and the second is the challenge of the von Neumann bottleneck. According to Moore's law, device size was made smaller and smaller. However, at present, the device size is close to the physical limit and Moore's law is gradually failing. Meanwhile, information processing in the von Neumann computer requires the transmission between processor and memory units, which is unfavorable for computational efficiency and the size of the architecture. As computing speed increases, the energy consumption becomes larger. In the famous manmachine battle, the power of the artificial intelligence AlphaGo is about 150 kW. These problems of von Neumann computers will become more serious with the spread of the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence. As an efficient solution for complex data processing, neuromorphic electronics that emulate the functions and the information processing of the human brain have been proposed.\n\nThe human brain is a highly efficient computing system that can process input information and react to external stimuli with ultralow energy consumption of ~20 W and small volume occupation of ~1200 cm3 [151]. Neurons are often considered as the computational engines of the human brain.\n\nThe signals conducted between neurons depend on the recent activities at either or both sides of the synapse. The connection strength between synapses is known as synaptic plasticity. Synaptic plasticity consists of three different styles: 1)\nlong-term plasticity, in which the change of synapses can last for hours or longer and is considered to be memory; 2) homeostatic plasticity, which keeps the neurons in an appropriate state; and 3) short-term plasticity, in which the signals that occur in the synapses last for milliseconds or minutes, and is considered as a critical computational function in neural systems.\n\nSynapses are the basic units of computing and learning in the human brain. To build artificial neuromorphic systems inspired by the human brain, the basic requirement is to prepare a device that can simulate synaptic behaviors. In the past few years, complementary metal oxide semiconductor\n(CMOS) integrated circuits have been used to mimic the synaptic functions, such as IBM's TrueNorth chip that integrated 5.4 billion transistors to simulate 1 million neurons and 256 million synapses[152]. However, large-scale CMOS-based analog circuits consume a large amount of energy, which hinders the development of the CMOS synaptic applications. In recent years, the design of a single device that mimics syn-\n\n![13_image_0.png](13_image_0.png)\n\naptic functions has received a lot of attention, such as two-terminal memristors[153−156]. Two-terminal memristors consist of three layers, two electrodes for sending and receiving information, and a 'storage' layer between them to memorize the information. Although two-terminal memristors possess the advantages of small size, simple device structure and low-energy consumption, the instability of the device and the integration difficulty may hinder their application in neuromorphic systems. Recently, three-/multi-terminal transistors have attracted much attention[157]. Unlike two-terminal memristors, these transistors have a gate to control the channel conductance and the energy consumption of the device can be lower. Furthermore, three-/multi-terminal transistors have good stability, controllable parameters and easy integration. For the emulation of synaptic behaviors, as shown in Fig. 19, the gate electrode is used as the presynaptic terminal and the channel layer with source/drain electrodes is considered as the postsynaptic terminal. The information transmission and process in the synapse starts from the triggering of the presynaptic pulse. Then, electrical activities in the pre-synapse are converted to the release of neurotransmitters and the post-synapse receives the neurotransmitters. Consequently, the current/potential of the post-synapse is changed. When a pulse voltage is applied to the gate electrode, the conductance of the channel layer is changed, which can be measured by applying a small voltage between the source and drain electrodes.\n\nHerein, we will demonstrate the works reported by our group about the application of IGZO-based TFT in synaptic networks and neuromorphic systems[35−37, 42, 43, 45, 158−161]. As early as 2009, Jiang and Wan et al. reported the first ultralowvoltage IGZO-based electric-double-layer (EDL) TFT[44]. This TFT exhibited an ultralow operation voltage about 1.0 V, a high μFE of 28.5 cm2/(V·s), and a low SS of 110 mV/decade.\n\nThis ultralow-voltage operation was ascribed to the large EDL capacitance. Usually, in a liquid or solid electrolyte, mobile cations and anions are filled between two electrodes. When an external voltage is applied to the electrodes, the cations and anions will move to the surface of electrolyte/electrode, respectively, which is the charging process and will contribute a large EDL capacitance[162]. In our work, the proton H+ in mesoporous SiO2 moved from one bridging oxygen atom to another. When a negative dc voltage was applied to the gate electrode, the H+ would move to the dielectric/channel interface. Simultaneously, the electrons in the n-type IGZO channel accumulated near the interface, due to the combination of the gate potential bias. Importantly, this work laid a solid foundation for the follow-up research of IGZO-based TFT artificial synapse devices.\n\nIt is essential for synaptic transistors to have low-energy consumption. Zhou and Wan et al. presented flexible EDL IGZO-based TFTs with the energy consumption as low as 0.23 pJ/spike[161]. In this work, short-term synaptic plasticity and high-pass filtering behaviors are also mimicked. Figs. 20(a)\nand 20(b) show the structure of the device and a simple image of the artificial synapse, respectively. The artificial synapse is composed of an IGZO transistor. The gate is considered as the pre-synapse and the channel is considered as the post-synapse. When the voltage pulse is applied to the gate, a spike could be measured in the drain electrode, which simulates the information transfer process in the synapse.\n\nFig. 20(c) shows the paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) curve that the excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) triggered by a pair of gate voltage spikes. The PPF reached a maximum value of 192% when the time interval was 20 ms, and it was reduced to 100% because the time interval is long enough. When the time interval between the pair of gate voltage spikes is shorter than the relaxation time of the protons in the nanogranular P-doped SiO2, some of the protons could not diffuse back to their equilibrium position before the second spike arrives, causing a large PPF. However, with the increase of the interval time, the protons gradually move back to their equilibrium position and the PPF gradually decreases. Fig. 20(d)\nshows the EPSC amplitude gain as a function of spike frequency. As the frequency of the voltage train changed from 1 to 50 Hz, the gain increased from ~1.0 to ~3.7. These results demonstrate the high-pass synaptic dynamic filtering of the IGZO-based neuromorphic TFTs.\n\nEmulation of the short-term synaptic plasticity and synaptic filtering based on IGZO-based EDL TFTs was proposed by Wan et al.\n\n[45]. To simulate the synaptic facilitation and depression function, a three-terminal device was reduced to a two-terminal synaptic device. High-pass and low-pass filtering were successfully simulated. Figs. 21(a) and 21(b) show schematic images of the IGZO-based EDL TFT. In Fig. 21(a),\nthe drain electrode and gate electrode were shortly connected as the presynaptic terminal. When we applied a positive voltage to the drain electrode, the protons in the electrolyte migrated to the IGZO channel/electrolyte interface. The EPSC was increased and the facilitation simulation was achieved.\n\nFig. 21(b) shows that the source electrode and gate electrode were shortly connected as post-synapse terminal to emulate the short-term depression behavior. When the positive spike was applied to the drain electrode, the protons in the electrolyte migrated to gate electrode/electrolyte interface.\n\nThe response current gradually reduced and synaptic depression can be obtained. Figs. 21(c) and 21(d) show the facilitation and depression simulations with the EPSC as a function of the pulse number and rate, respectively.\n\nOur brain contains more synapses than neurons, which guarantees multiple information processing. It is suggested that the multi-terminal neuro transistors are more suitable for complex neural network simulation[163]. He and Wan et al. proposed capacitively coupled multi-terminal IGZO-based neur-\n\n![14_image_0.png](14_image_0.png)\n\n![14_image_1.png](14_image_1.png)\n\nomorphic TFT and neural network for spatiotemporal information processing[36]. The multi-gate terminals and the channel of the TFT are coupled by strong lateral ionic/electronic coupling effect. In the simulation, electric pulse sequences applied on the multi-gate are used as spatiotemporal information and the response is read from the source/drain. Multigate terminals and source/drain electrodes are used as presynaptic neuron (PREN) terminals and postsynaptic neuron\n(POSTN), respectively. A neural network consisting of two PRENs and POSTNs was proposed to emulate the sound azimuth detection as shown in Fig. 22(b). PREN1 and PREN2 are used as left and right ear sensing neurons, respectively. Fig. 22(a) shows a schematic diagram of sound location of the ears. An electrical pulse is applied on PREN2 and then the same pulse is applied on PREN1 when the sound is from the right direction, and vice versa. The time interval represents the sound azimuth. Fig. 22(c) shows that the POSTN1 and POSTN2 could produce different response (IPOST1 and IPOST2)\nto the sound direction. Fig. 22(d) shows that the ratio of the amplitude of IPOST2 and IPOST1 varies with the sound azimuth.\n\nThus, the neural network can realize sound azimuth detection function. A network that can realize spatiotemporal information processing is of great interest for brain-like computing in the future.\n\n## 4.  Conclusions And Outlook\n\nIn this review, we have discussed IGZO materials, devices and recent developments of the IGZO-based TFT applications. In the introduction, the history, electron travelling orbitals and deposition methods of the IGZO materials are presented. Then, capitalizing on the unique properties of IGZObased TFTs, such as relatively high mobility, good optical transparency and good compatibility with traditional CMOS technology, numerous devices based on IGZO-based TFTs have been demonstrated. For these applications, IGZO-based TFTs are not only promising candidates for display applications\n\n![15_image_0.png](15_image_0.png)\n\nbut are also actively involved in sensor applications and neuromorphic systems.\n\nGreat progress has been made in implementing IGZObased TFTs into mainstream display technologies such as LCDs and OLEDs. However, the brightness uniformity of the panel, the stability of the device and the yield hinder the progress of the high ppi, the large size, the narrow bezel and the true flexible display panels. We believe that these problems will be overcome in the not-too-distant future and that the IGZO-based TFTs will gradually dominate the display market.\n\nThe application of display derivers may be the main development direction of the IGZO-based TFTs in the future.\n\nBased on the state-of-the-art understanding of the properties of the IGZO-based TFTs, multifunctional sensors such as photoelectric sensors, pressure sensors, pH sensors and gas sensors have been fabricated. Nevertheless, the low detection precision hinders their further application in the field of sensing. For pH sensors, the pH sensitivity based on the ISFET is limited by the Nernst limit of about 59 mV/pH. For photoelectric sensors, the persistent photoconductivity effect has greatly limited the detection accuracy. However, by optimizing thin-film fabrication strategies, the structure of the device and the fabrication technology, it is predicted that sensors based on IGZO-based TFTs will appear in consumer products.\n\nAlthough some neuromorphic devices based on IGZObased TFTs have been fabricated and some important synaptic/neuronal functions have been emulated, the development of the emerging neuromorphic device and system is still in its early stage. There is still a lot of room for optimization in device technology and structure. In the future, three-dimensional integration is one of the most important issues for a large-scale neuromorphic system. Finally, the key challenge for brain-like computing and perception is to explore and understand the spatiotemporal dynamic algorithm used in our brain. Consequently, interdisciplinarity between microelectronics and neuroscience is crucial for disruptive innovation in neuromorphic system.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThe authors are grateful for the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 62074075, 61834001), and the National Key R&D Program of China (Grant No. 2019YFB2205400).\n\n## References\n\n[1]\nKimizuka N, Mohri T.

Barquinha , And R. Martins\n\n Transparent electronics is today one of the most advanced topics for a wide range of device applications. The key components are wide bandgap semiconductors, where oxides of different origins play an important role, not only as passive component but also as active component, similar to what is observed in conventional semiconductors like silicon. Transparent electronics has gained special attention during the last few years and is today established as one of the most promising technologies for leading the next generation of fl at panel display due to its excellent electronic performance. In this paper the recent progress in n- and p-type oxide based thin-fi lm transistors (TFT) is reviewed, with special emphasis on solution-processed and p-type, and the major milestones already achieved with this emerging and very promising technology are summarizeed. After a short introduction where the main advantages of these semiconductors are presented, as well as the industry expectations, the beautiful history of TFTs is revisited, including the main landmarks in the last 80 years, fi nishing by referring to some papers that have played an important role in shaping transparent electronics. Then, an overview is presented of state of the art n-type TFTs processed by physical vapour deposition methods, and fi nally one of the most exciting, promising, and low cost but powerful technologies is discussed: solution-processed oxide TFTs. Moreover, a more detailed focus analysis will be given concerning p-type oxide TFTs, mainly centred on two of the most promising semiconductor candidates: copper oxide and tin oxide. The most recent data related to the production of complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) devices based on n- and p-type oxide TFT is also be presented. The last topic of this review is devoted to some emerging applications, fi nalizing with the main conclusions. Related work that originated at CENIMAT | I3N during the last six years is included in more detail, which has led to the fabrication of high performance n- and p-type oxide transistors as well as the fabrication of CMOS devices with and on paper. \n\n 1. Introduction Oxide semiconductors, especially the amorphous ones, are a promising class of TFT materials that have made an impressive progress particularly in display applications in a relatively short Prof. E. Fortunato , Dr. P. Barquinha , Prof. R. Martins CENIMAT/I3N, Departamento de Ciência dos Materiais Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia FCT, Universidade Nova de Lisboa and CEMOP-UNINOVA 2829-516 Caparica, Portugal E-mail: elvira.fortunato@fct.unl.pt DOI: 10.1002/adma.201103228 Adv. *Mater.* 2012, 24**, 2945–2986**\ntime, [1] challenging silicon not only in conventional applications but opening doors to completely new and disruptive areas like paper electronics. [2,3] The key issues here are the ability to produce such semiconductors at low process temperatures and to have highly smooth surfaces, characteristic of amorphous structures, whose electronic performances do not depend on the degree of fi lms disorder. [4] This new class of semiconductor materials, amorphous oxides semiconductors (AOS) represent a revolutionary idea and exhibit a stimulating combination of high optical transparency, high electron mobility and amorphous microstructure. [5,6] Besides that, AOSs do not have grain boundaries, thereby obviating the primary limitation of mobility in polycrystalline semiconductors, which is a huge advantage for process integration. Other advantages include low temperature deposition routes and ultrasmooth surfaces for suppressing interface traps and scattering centres. Besides the advantages of this new technology like the capability for providing real solutions and overcoming many obstacles and limitations of the conventional silicon technology, the used materials as well as the technology itself are environmental friendly and much less expensive. [7]\n Although some initial attempts during the 60s were done for SnO 2\n[8] and ZnO [9]\nTFT channel layers, only forty years later, with the work of Hosono, [10] Wager, [11] Carcia [12] and Fortunato [13] a signifi cant worldwide interest appeared, especially for active matrix for organic light emitting diodes (AMOLED) technology, both in academia and industry. Besides the demonstration of display prototypes since 2005 by several companies (Toppan Printing, Samsung Electronics, LG Electronics, AU Optronics, among others), Samsung has released at the end of 2010 what they boast proudly as one of the world's fi nest and largest 3D Ultra Defi nition (UD) TV with 70\" diagonal and a sports resolution of 240 Hz that will meet the demands of 3D capability. Samsung has claimed that the making of this device is the fi rst of the kind on oxide semiconductor TFT technology that supports high pixel density, with a resolution of 3840 × 2160, which is equivalent to 8 MP. Although the fi rst transparent display has \n© 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim **2945**\n\n![0_image_2.png](0_image_2.png)\n\nwileyonlinelibrary.com\n\n![0_image_0.png](0_image_0.png)\n\nbeen done using the conventional a-Si:H technology in 2005 by J. Jang et al. [14] only very recently Samsung announced the mass production of transparent liquid crystal display (LCD)\npanels, which enables a person to look right through the panel like glass, and it consumes 90% less electricity when compared to a conventional LCD panel using back light unit. This can be achieved because a transparent LCD panel utilizes ambient light such as sunlight, which consequently reduces the dependency on electricity for generating power.\n\nAs expected from the already obtained results, the future of transparent electronics seems very promising, since from the last available display market forecast by Displaybank,[15] transparent display would debut the market for the first time in 2012 and sharply grow to create $87.2 billion market by year 2025 as can been seen in the semi-logarithmic plot in Figure 1.\n\nTable 1 presents a summary and comparison of some of the most important device properties for the different available technologies: oxide semiconductors; amorphous Si; low temperature polycrystalline Si and organic semiconductors.\n\n## 2. History Of Oxide Tfts\n\nThe history of TFTs is the oldest one concerning electronic devices and has more than 80 years. The invention of the TFT\noccurred in 1925 and was patented in 1930 by J.E. Lilienfeld [21 - 23 ]\nand O. Heil, [24] but at that time little was known about semiconductor materials and vacuum techniques to produce thin films. Therefore, these first reports are actually concept patents and no evidence exists about the production of devices. Still, in these patents, the idea of controlling the current flow in a material by the influence of a transversal electrical field was already present. One of Lilienfeld first patents, published in 1930, describes the basic principle of what is known today as the metal- semiconductor field- effect transistor (MESFET, Figure 2a),\nwhile other, published three years later, already shows the concept of a device where an insulating material (aluminium oxide)\nis introduced between the semiconductor (cooper sulfide) and\n\n![1_image_4.png](1_image_4.png)\n\nmarket (from Displaybank [15] ).\n\nElvira Fortunato received her\n\n![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)\n\nPhD degree in Physics and Materials Science in 1995 at Universidade Nova de Lisboa.\n\nShe has been a Full Professor since 2012 in the Materials Science Department of the same University and has been director of the Materials Research Centre (CENIMAT) since 1998. Fortunato pioneered European research on transparent electronics, namely thin-film transistors based on oxide semiconductors, demonstrating that oxide materials may be used as true semiconductors.\n\n![1_image_1.png](1_image_1.png)\n\n![1_image_3.png](1_image_3.png)\n\nPedro Barquinha received\n\n![1_image_2.png](1_image_2.png)\n\nthe PhD degree from Universidade Nova de Lisboa in 2010, in Nanotechnologies and Nanosciences, with the dissertation \"Transparent Oxide Thin-Film Transistors\".\n\nHis current research topics are the study of materials for transparent/flexible TFTs and integration in circuits, as well as the nanofabrication of Rodrigo Martins received his MSc degree in Amorphous Semiconductor Technologies in 1977, supervised by W. Spear of Dundee University/Scotland. He got the PhD degree in Semiconductors (1982) and in 1988 the Aggregation in Microelectronics, by Universidade Nova de Lisboa. He is Full Professor in Microelectronics and Optoelectronics since 2001 in the Materials Science Department of the same University and the head of department since 1996. In 1989 found the Centre of Excellence in Microelectronics and Optoelectronics (CEMOP/Uninova) and in 1993 the research material's center, CENIMAT. Since 2004 he is a member of the executive committees of the European Materials Research Society (EMRS) and of the European Materials Forum (EMF) and, since May 2011 the running president of E-MRS.

[26] As it is normal with many innovations at that time, its practical realization was delayed until adequate materials and technologies were available for its fabrication. We can even say (and for most of us it could be surprising) that the TFT was the first solid-state amplifier ever patented.\n\nIt took one more decade for the first TFT to be produced. This was achieved by Weimer at the RCA Laboratories in 1962 [27-29] Weimer used a vacuum technique (evaporation) to deposit gold electrodes, a polycrystalline cadmium sulfide (CdS) n-type semiconductor and a silicon monoxide insulator, using shadow masks to define the patterns of these layers. He used thin films of polycrystalline CdS semiconductor, similar to those developed for photodetectors, deposited onto glass substrates. In one pump down of his vacuum system, he would deposit a gold source and drain, then deposit polycrystalline semiconductor material over that and, finally, place a gate on top. This was a coplanar process that was similar to what he used in the tricolor vidicon. It should be noted that Weimer's work depended on depositions, not photoresists, which were used in developing integrated circuits, just then getting under way. At first, these deposited transistors weren't very good. But then he placed an insulator between the gate and the semiconductor material and got what he called \"beautiful characteristics\". His 1962 paper,\n\"The TFT - A New Thin-Film Transistor\", in the Proceedings of the IEEE drew worldwide attention. [ 27 ]\nWeimer used cadmium sulfide as the semiconductor material because it was a high-resistivity semiconductor with which he was somewhat familiar. Moreover, this was a pre-requirement to allow the conductance modulation via induced charges through the insulator layer. He later used cadmium selenide. This made for an even better field-effect transistor, not as good as silicon, Weimer recalls, but quite respectable.\n\nFigure 3 shows the cross sectional and top views, output characteristics and a picture of a 1-in square glass plate (mounted on a lucite block) upon which three transistors have ben evaporated.\n\nAlthough the birth of transparent electronics is normally associated with reports on ZnO TFTs presented in 2001-2003, there were some tentative applications of oxide semiconductors as channel layers in TFTs forty years before, almost coincident with the initial CdS TFTs reported by Weimer in 1961. In fact, back in 1964, Klasens and Koelmans [8] proposed a TFT comprising an evaporated SnO 2 semiconductor on glass, with aluminium source-drain and gate electrodes and an anodized Al 2 O 3 gate delectric. Few details regarding electrical performance are provided and the transparent semiconductor is essentially used to demonstrate a new self-aligned lift-off process, where the SnO 2 layer allows to expose the photoresist to UV light penetrating from the bottom of the structure in all the areas expect the one\n\n![2_image_1.png](2_image_1.png)\n\nREVIEW\n\n![3_image_0.png](3_image_0.png)\n\nshielded by the aluminium gate electrode, defi ning this way the pattern of the source-drain electrodes ( **Figure** 4 a). In 1968, Boesen and Jacobs [9] reported a TFT with a lithium-doped ZnO \nsingle crystal semiconductor, with evaporated SiO x dielectric and aluminium electrodes, but a very small drain current (I D ) modulation by applying a gate voltage (V G ) and no I D saturation were observed on these devices (Figure 4 b).\n\n Aoki and Sasakura [32] obtained similar poor electrical performance in SnO 2 TFTs in 1970. Only in 1996 oxide semiconductors reappeared as channel layers, with two reports on ferroelectric fi eld-effect devices employing SnO 2 :Sb and In 2 O 3 , by Prins et al. and Seager, respectively. [31,33] Given that the main intent of the authors was to demonstrate hysteresis associated with the ferroelectric behaviour, little information is provided on these papers about device performance, but Prins and coworkers, for instance, report a low on/off ratio of 60. Still, it is noteworthy to observe that full transparency is for the fi rst time persuaded in a TFT and it is only severely affected by the SrRuO 3 gate electrode (Figure 4 c), although the authors mention that they also fabricated a fully transparent TFT by using a heavily doped SnO 2 gate electrode. \n\n But good performing devices showing that oxide semiconductor-based TFTs could be a viable technology only started to appear in 2003, with the reports on ZnO TFTs by Hoffman et al, Carcia et al.and Masuda et al. [11,12,34] Hoffman and Carcia reported fully transparent devices (comprising TCO-based electrodes), already allowing to obtain respectable performance, comparable and even surpassing in some aspects the one typically exhibited by a-Si:H and organic TFTs, mostly in terms of mobility, which could be as high as 2.5 cm 2 V − 1 s − 1 . \n\nHowever, the processing or post-processing temperatures of the semiconductor necessary to obtain good devices were still quite high, between 450-600 ° C. But the work from Carcia et al. \n\n2948 wileyonlinelibrary.com © **2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim**\nshowed that using r.f. magnetron sputtering to deposit ZnO, similar electrical properties could be achieved with room-temperature processing of the semiconductor layer, even if on this case fully transparent structures were not demonstrated. After 2004 several reports continued to appear on oxide semiconductor-based TFTs, bringing different innovations to this emerging area. Some of the most important achievements were: \nZnO TFTs exhibiting improved device performance (mainly regarding mobility) while keeping low or even room temperature ZnO \nprocessing; [35–37] non-vacuum processes to produce the ZnO layers; [38] fi rst simulations of ZnO TFTs assuming that their properties are largely dictated by the polycrystalline nature of ZnO; [39] new methods for extraction of mobility in ZnO TFTs; [40] fully transparent ZnO TFTs produced at room temperature; [13]\napplication of ZnO TFTs as UV photodetectors; [41,42] exploration of SnO 2 TFTs [43] and use of In 2 O 3 or ZnO nanowires as channel layers. [25,44–46]\n While most of the research work was being devoted to binary oxides such as ZnO, In 2 O 3 or SnO 2 , Nomura et al. suggested in 2003 to use a complex InGaO 3 (ZnO) 5 (or GIZO) single-crystalline semiconductor layer in a TFT. [47] This layer was epitaxially grown on an yttria-stabilized zirconia substrate and allowed to obtain an impressive effective mobility of 80 cm 2 V − 1 s − 1 , turn-on voltage of −0.5 V \nand on/off ratio of 10 6 . Even if a very high temperature of 1400 ° C was necessary to attain this level of performance, this paper made history, since it proves that high-performance oxide semiconductor-based TFTs are a reality. And in fact, in the following year Nomura et al. presented a work that defi nitely evidenced the enormous potential of oxide semiconductors (and multicomponent oxides in particular) for TFT applications, by demonstrating a transparent TFT on a fl exible substrate using near-room temperature processing ( **Figure** 5 ). [10] For this end, they used a PLD deposited amorphous GIZO layer as the semiconductor. Even if the performance was far from the singlecrystalline TFTs presented by the same authors, a saturation mobility of 9 cm 2 V − 1 s − 1 , threshold voltage of 1–2 V and on/off ratio of 10 3 could still be achieved, mostly because the low sensitivity of these multicomponent oxides to structural disorder.\n\n Nomura's work opened the door for an impressively growing number of publications in the next years (see Figure 10 related to the evolution of papers published per year in this topic) regarding the application of amorphous multicomponent oxides as channel layers in TFTs. Several combinations of cations with \n(n-1)d 10 ns 0 (n ≥ 4) electronic confi guration [4] started to be used for this end, being ZTO, [48–51] IZO, [52–55] and GIZO [6,56–60] the most widely explored ones. With the continuous improvements verifi ed on these devices, it is now common to obtain remarkable electrical properties, considerably superior to a-Si:H [61] or organic TFTs, such as mobilities above 10 cm 2 V − 1 s − 1 , turn-on voltages close to 0 V, on/off ratio exceeding 10 7 and subthreshold swing of 0.20 V dec − 1 , with the indium-based semiconductors Adv. *Mater.* 2012, 24**, 2945–2986**\n\n![4_image_0.png](4_image_0.png)\n\nhaving the added advantage of allowing for very low or even room temperature processing. In fact, nowadays the processing temperature of these TFTs is dictated not by the semiconductor layer, but rather by the dielectric. Furthermore, it is important to note that if fl exible and fully transparent TFTs are envisaged, the optimization of highly conducting TCOs deposited near room temperature for application as source, drain and gate electrodes is also a crucial requirement. [62–65]\n Another important aspect deals with dielectric materials. \n\nBesides the huge development made on oxide semiconductors the dielectric has been somehow forgotten or, at least, left on a second plane, despite being as important as the channel layer on a TFT as its properties determines the charge accumulation at the dielectric/semiconductor interface. However, the existence of defects at the interface, as well as within the dielectric itself limits to a large extent the device's static and dynamic performance and reliability, on parameters such as mobility, leakage current, and photo-stability under electrical stress. This last topic is critical, nevertheless it is not explored in detail in this review, as there is not yet a consensus about the origin of this instability. It is known that the photoreliability of oxide TFTs is mostly deteriorated by negative rather than by positive bias stress. Several degradation models have been proposed, including the trapping of photogenerated hole carriers, [66,67] the creation of ionized oxygen vacancies [68] and the photodesorption of oxygen molecules. [69]\nIn addition, the photoreliability is affected by a large number of parameters such as device structure/layout, semiconductor/ dielectric material composition, passivation, among others, which limits a detailed analysis. A dedicated review on photo-stability should be taken into consideration in the future. \n\n Based on all this, it seems that oxide semiconductors provide a solid and viable alternative for the present and future of TFTs, covering important drawbacks of the existing technologies, being a very attractive technology that allows for transparent, low cost, low temperature and high performance devices. \n\nFigure 6 shows a schematic of the main landmarks achieved with either generic TFTs or oxide based TFTs. Figure 6 . **Main landmarks achieved with TFTs.** \nAdv. *Mater.* 2012, 24**, 2945–2986**\n 3. Device Structure and Operation TFTs are three terminal fi eld-effect devices, whose working principle relies on the modulation of the current fl owing in a semiconductor placed between two electrodes (source and drain). A dielectric layer is inserted between the semiconductor and a transversal electrode (gate), being the current modulation achieved by the capacitive injection of carriers close to the dielectric/semiconductor interface, known as fi eld effect. [26]\nFigure 7 shows the most common TFT \nstructures. Depending if the source-drain are on opposite sides or on the same side of the semiconductor, the structures are identifi ed as staggered and coplanar according to Weimer's defi nition. [70] Inside these, top- and bottom-gate structures exist, depending on whether the gate electrode is on top or bottom of the structure.\n\n Each of these structures presents advantages/disadvantages, largely dictated by the materials used to fabricate the TFTs. For instance, the staggered bottom-gate confi guration is widely used for the fabrication of a-Si:H TFTs, due to easier processing and enhanced electrical properties. As a-Si:H is light sensitive, the usage of this confi guration is advantageous for the application of these TFTs in LCDs, since the metal gate electrode shields the semiconductor material from the effect of the backlight present on these displays. On the other hand, a coplanar top-gate structure is normally preferred for poly-Si TFTs. This is mostly attributed to the fact that the crystallization process of the semiconductor material generally requires high temperatures that could degrade the properties of other materials (and their interfaces) previously deposited, being favoured if the semiconductor is a fl at and continuous fi lm without any layers beneath it. Furthermore, the fact that in bottom-gate structures (both staggered and coplanar) the semiconductor surface is exposed to air can bring undesirable instability effects but can also be explored as a way to easily modify its properties, for instance by the facilitated adsorption of impurities during annealing or plasma treatments in a suitable atmosphere. \n\n The schematics in Figure 7 only show the fundamental layers of a TFT, but other layers can also be introduced for different purposes. As an example, in silicon technology it is common to use highly doped semiconductor layers at the source-drain \n\nREVIEW\n\n![5_image_0.png](5_image_0.png)\n\nregions, in order to form low-resistance contacts. Also, an insulating fi lm is often deposited on top of the semiconductor layer in staggered bottom-gate structures. This can allow for more accurate etching of the source-drain electrodes, without damaging the semiconductor surface, i.e. act as an etch-stopper. [71,72]\nThis insulating layer can also have interesting effects on semiconductor fi lms that strongly interact with environmental species such as oxygen or moisture, which is refl ected in large variations of the electrical properties exhibited by the TFTs. This is particularly relevant for some of the fi rst semiconductors used in TFTs, such as CdSe, and also for oxide semiconductors. Additionally, the insulating layer on top of the TFT structure can work as an effective mechanical and chemical protection of the devices from subsequent processes, such as their integration with liquid crystal cells. [73]\n TFTs are quite similar to other fi eld-effect devices in terms of operation and composing layers, such as the well-known MOSFETs used in high performance applications such as microprocessors or memories. However, important differences exist between these devices, some of them readily seen by inspecting their typical structures ( **Figure** 8 ). First, while TFTs use an insulating substrate, normally glass, in MOSFETs the silicon \n\n![5_image_1.png](5_image_1.png)\n\nwafer acts both as the substrate and the semiconductor. Thus, higher performance naturally arises for MOSFETs, given that the electrons fl ow in a single crystalline semiconductor, rather than in a polycrystalline or amorphous one. Also, the temperatures involved in the fabrication of both devices are quite different: while processing temperatures exceeding 1000 ° C are common for MOSFETs, for instance to create the dielectric layer, in TFTs they are limited by parameters such as the softening point of the substrate, which for most common glass substrates does not exceed 600–650 ° C. [71] In addition, MOSFETs have p-n junctions at the sourcedrain regions, which are absent in TFTs. This is related with another important difference in device operation: even if both TFTs and MOSFETs rely on the fi eld effect to modulate the conductance of the semiconductor close to its interface with the dielectric, in TFTs this is achieved by an accumulation layer, while in MOSFETs an inversion region has to be formed close to that interface, i.e., a n-type conductive layer is created in a p-type silicon substrate.\n\n The most important TFT static characteristics are extracted from the output and transfer characteristics shown in **Figure** 9 a and b, respectively and are: mobility ( µ ), on/off ratio, turn-on voltage (V ON ) and subthreshold swing (S).\n\nOn/off ratio : This is simply defi ned as the ratio of the maximum to the minimum I D . The minimum I D is generally given by the noise level of the measurement equipment or by the gate leakage current (I G ), while the maximum I D depends on the semiconductor material itself and on the effectiveness of capacitive injection by the fi eld effect. On/off above 10 6 are typically obtained in TFTs and a large value is required for their successful usage as electronic switches; [74]\nV T */V* ON : V T corresponds to the V G for which an accumulation layer or conductive channel is formed close to the dielectric/semiconductor interface, between the source and drain electrodes (channel region). For an n-type TFT, depending upon whether V T is positive or negative, the devices are designated as enhancement or depletion mode, respectively. Both types are useful for circuit fabrication, but generally enhancement mode is preferable, because no V G is required to turn off the transistor, simplifying the circuit design and minimizing power dissipation. [11] V T can be determined using different methodologies, such as linear extrapolation of the I D -V G plot (for low V D ) or of the I D\n1/2 -V G plot (for high V D ), V G corresponding to a specifi c I D , \nratio of conductance and transconductance, among others. [75] Even if considering only one methodology, large ambiguity can arise on the determination of V T (for instance, by using different parameters in the linear fi ttings). The concept of V ON is largely used in literature, simply corresponding to the V G at which I D starts to increase as seen in a log Adv. *Mater.* 2012, 24**, 2945–2986**\n\n![6_image_0.png](6_image_0.png)\n\nI D - V G plot, or in other words, the V G necessary to fully turn-off the transistor. [ 40 ]\nSubthreshold swing (S) : The inverse of the maximum slope of the transfer characteristic, it indicates the necessary V G to increase I D by one decade:\n\n## S =\n\n$$\\mathbf{f}:\\left(\\left.{\\frac{d l o g(I_{D})}{d V_{G}}}\\right|_{\\mathrm{max}}\\right)^{-1}\\tag{1}$$\n$${}^{(1)}$$\n\nTypically, S << 1, around 0.10–0.30 V dec–1 and small values result in higher speeds and lower power consumption. [74]\nMobility (μ) : This is related with the efficiency of carrier transport in a material, affecting directly the maximum I D and operating frequency of devices. [76] In a material, μ is affected by several scattering mechanisms, such as lattice vibrations, ionized impurities, grain boundaries and other structural defects. [ 76 , 77 ]\nOn a TFT, since the movement of carriers is constrained to a narrow region close to the dielectric/semiconductor interface, additional sources of scattering should be considered, such as Coulomb scattering from dielectric charges and from interface states or surface roughness scattering. [77] Still, note that in a TFT µ is modulated by V G , so scattering mechanisms become less relevant for particular bias conditions. Mobility of a TFT\ncan be extracted using different methodologies. Following Schroder's nomenclature, one may have: [77]\nEffective mobility ( μ eff ): Obtained by the conductance ( g e ) with low V D :\n\n$$\\mu_{e f f}={\\frac{g_{d}}{C_{i}{\\frac{W}{L}}(V_{G}-V_{T})}}$$\n\nField-effect mobility ( μ FE ): Obtained by the transconductance\n(g m ) with low V D :\n\n$$\\mu_{{}_{E F}}={\\frac{g_{m}}{C_{i}{\\frac{W}{L}}V_{D}}}\\,$$\n\nSaturation mobility ( μ zat ): Obtained by the transconductance with high V D :\n\n$$\\mu_{s a t}={\\frac{\\left({\\frac{d{\\sqrt{T_{D}}}}{d V_{G}}}\\right)^{2}}{{\\frac{1}{2}}C i{\\frac{W}{L}}}}$$\n\n$$\\left({}^{4}\\right)$$\n\nEach methodology has its advantages and drawbacks. Even if µ eff includes the important effect of V G , it requires the determination of V T and is more sensitive to contact resistance (low Vp). This last issue is also verified for µ Fg , but µ Fg does not require V T and is easily calculated by the derivative of transfer characteristics, consequently it is a widely used parameter.\n\nFinally, µ SAT does not require V T and is less sensitive to contact resistance. However, it describes a situation where the channel is pinched-off, i.e., its effective length is smaller than L , which is intrinsically not assumed by the classical model.[26]\nOther methodologies can be found in literature, such as the average ( µ avg ) and incremental ( µ inc ) mobility proposed by Hoffman. [40] While the former provides an average value of all the carriers induced in the channel, the latter probes the mobility of carriers as they are incrementally added to the channel, providing valuable insights into carrier transport.\n\nIn most manuscripts only a peak value of µ cff , µ FE or µ zat is presented. However, by plotting Equations 2, 3 or 4 as a function of V G\nallows for a more complete understanding of the device physics, clearly showing effects such as mobility degradation due to contact resistance or increased interface scattering as V G increases.\n\n## 4. Recent Progress Of N-Type Oxide Tfts 4.1. Historical Overview\n\nThe large number of research groups that are now working on transparent electronics have produced more than 541 papers between 2001 and 2010, which limits a precise and detailed analysis of the work. In order to have an idea about the scientific output in terms of papers produced, in the graphic of Figure 10 we show the evolution of published papers between 2001 and 2010 only related to n-type oxide based TFTs. The bar chart is divided into three main categories function of the semiconductor channel layer: ZnO, GIZO and others including ZTO, ITO, IZO, IZTO, IGO and IHZO.\n\nFrom the bar chart it is interesting to point out the sharp increase of publications appearing after 2006, reaching a total of 161 in 2009. In 2010 it was observed a small decrease WALVEN\n\n$$\\left(2\\right)$$\n$$({\\mathfrak{I}})$$\n\nREVIEW\n\n![7_image_0.png](7_image_0.png)\n\nconcerning the number of GIZO TFTs publications, but this could be associated to the fact that we have now industries starting producing displays using this technology, which pushes the researchers to investigate new materials as well as new technologies. From the graphic it is also interesting to see the evolution for solution processed TFTs especially after 2009 (a detailed analysis will be given in the next section).\n\nFrom the analysis of roughly 200 papers published on GIZO\nTFTs two aspects can be highlighted: first, the leading deposition technique is sputtering (more than 90%), and secondly it is possible to grow GIZO TFIs at temperatures lower than 150 °C\nwith acceptable electrical performance. Besides the common part associated with the channel layer material, it is very hard to compare the TFT characteristics since, the type of substrate and structures used are different. In some cases the channel layer is not patterned, the dielectric material and the interface are different and depending on the specific layout used we can have the source/drain electrodes completely overlapping the channel layer. [277] All these technological/geometry aspects will affect the electrical properties of the TFTs limiting a real comparison of devices produced in different laboratories, specially the figure of\n\n![7_image_2.png](7_image_2.png)\n\n## Ww.Materialsvie\n\nmerit: channel mobility. Besides that and since we do not want to repeat what is already published in some recent oxide based TFT\nreviews ( 20 , 278 , 279 ), we will present in this section a summary of the main achievements concerning n-type oxide TFIs. We have done an exhaustive survey at WOK from Thomson Reuters and have tried to include all the work published in this topic until the submission of this review (July 2011). If there is some work not included we would like to apologise the authors in advance. In the following paragraphs we will refer to the effect of chemical composition, electrical stability and passivation issues.\n\n## 4.2. Effect Of Oxide Semiconductor Composition\n\nStarting with the effect of GIZO composition on the TFTs electrical properties, some work was already been reported by Iwasaki et al. [60] and by Barquinha et al. [6] While Iwasaki used a combinatorial co- sputtering study with 3 oxide targets (ZnO,\nGa 2 O 3 and In 2 O 3 ), Barquinha et al. used specific GIZO target compositions. For this particular study the semiconductor layers were produced with an oxygen percentage of 0.4%, being the final devices annealed at T A = 150 °C. The devices, with a staggered bottom gate configuration, were produced on silicon substrates with 100 nm thick PECVD SiO 2 , using e-beam evaporated Ti-Au source/drain electrodes. Transfer characteristics are presented in Figure 11 and Figure 12 for binary/ternary and ternary/quaternary compounds, respectively, being the trends of µ FE and V ON with composition shown in Figure 13.\n\nThe analysis of the data denotes significant differences and trends. Starting by the TFTs comprising binary compounds, large differences are obtained for In 2 O 3 , ZnO and Ga 2 O 3 devices. This is naturally related with the different electrical properties of the respective thin films. For these deposition conditions the carrier concentration ( N ) is ≈ 10 18 cm − 3 for In 2 O 3 ,\nwhich renders the Fermi level ( E F ) to be very close to the conduction band minimum (CBM), making it impossible to deplete the semiconductor with reasonable V G values. Hence, even if a very large µ FE is achieved for the In 2 O 3 TFTs, due to the E F pinning above CBM as V G is increased, the devices are not usable as transistors, since they cannot be switched off. On the other hand, Ga 2 O 3 films have very large resistivity (ρ > 10 8 Ω cm), presumably due to a very low N and large density of empty traps, in addition to the large bandgap, above 4 eV. This results in\n\n![7_image_1.png](7_image_1.png)\n\nwileyonlinelibrary.com very poor device performance, with V ON > 20 V, µFE ≈ 0.02 cm 2 V − 1 s − 1 and large Δ V ON , above 6 V ( Δ V ON is the shift of V ON\nafter measuring the transfer characteristics three consecutive times, giving a fast indication of how stable the transistors are), \nwhich is not improved even for T A = 500 ° C. Matsuzaki et al. also reported similar characteristics for Ga 2 O 3 TFTs, with µinc ≈\n0.05 cm 2 V − 1 s − 1 and V ON > 10 V for T A = 500 ° C. [280] ZnO seems to be the best binary compound for oxide TFT application, at least considering the range of deposition conditions used herein. In fact, close to 0 V ON , *on/off* exceeding 10 6 and Δ V ON ≈\n1 V are achieved on these ZnO TFTs. Still, the small slope of the transfer characteristics is synonym of a relatively high S\n(0.90 V dec − 1 ) and the low maximum I D is indicative of a low µFE\n(1.6 cm 2 V − 1 s − 1 ). Two reasons can be pointed as the main justifi cation for the moderate performance of the ZnO TFTs: fi rst, ρ ≈ 10 7 Ω cm, which is indicative of low N and/or large unfi lled trap densities; second, the existence of grain boundaries, which are associated with depletion regions with high potential barriers that greatly affect the movement of free carriers. \n\n Multicomponent amorphous oxides, in general, allow for considerably better TFT performance than binary compounds. \n\nRather than having carrier transport limited by grain boundaries, in amorphous oxides carrier transport is mostly dictated by the potential barriers located around the CBM, associated with the structural randomness, which can easily be surpassed in properly processed fi lms by increasing V G . Furthermore, the relative proportion of the cations directly controls the background N within a broad range, which has direct implications on transistor performance. For IZO TFTs with In/(In + Zn) \natomic ratios between 0.50 and 0.80 it is verifi ed that the properties tend to get closer to the predominant binary compound, i.e., for In/(In + Zn) = 0.80 both I D and µFE are similar to In 2 O 3 TFTs, while for In/(In + Zn) = 0.50 the properties start to move away from those of In 2 O 3 TFTs toward the ones of ZnO TFTs. \n\nIntermediate properties are obtained for In/(In + Zn) = 0.67. \n\nThis means that N and µFE get higher for increased indium content, but only the IZO 1:1 TFTs are able to present clear on - and off -states within the V G range used here. Considerably better device performance is achieved using IGO [281] instead of IZO. \n\nThis arises as a direct consequence of the strong bonds that gallium forms with oxygen, [282] suppressing the generation of free carriers and raising ρ relatively to IZO fi lms. In fact, besides other important drawbacks of IZO such as increased light sensitivity, the diffi culty in controlling the background N down to low values (at least < 10 16 cm − 3 ) in IZO makes researchers (and industry) move for materials such as GIZO to fabricate the active layers of TFTs. Still, note that the problem of high background N can be attenuated by decreasing the semiconductor thickness ( d s ): for instance, by using IZO 2:1 d s = 10 nm rather than the \"standard\" 40 nm used for the oxide TFTs presented throughout this paper, the transistors can be fully switchedoff for V G <−7 V. This is justifi ed by the fact that the depletion region created at the back (i.e., air exposed) surface of the active layer due to the interaction with environmental oxygen can be extended to the semiconductor/dielectric interface when a low d s is used. [283]\n The effect of adding different amounts of gallium to IZO is shown in Figure 12 . Given the stronger bonds of gallium with oxygen, background N decreases as gallium content in GIZO \nincreases, resulting in a considerable shift of V ON toward more positive values. This is naturally advantageous for large In/\n(In + Zn), since it permits the production of TFTs that clearly switch between off - and on -states. However, for smaller In/\n(In + Zn), gallium incorporation can also lead to devices with considerably lower µFE and higher V ON and Δ V ON . This can be seen by comparing GIZO 2:4:2 with 2:2:1 and 2:2:2 compositions and is explained by the larger fraction of empty traps that need to be fi lled before E F reaches CBM or above it for materials with lower background N . Additionally, since the ratio of In/\n(In + Zn + Ga) starts to decrease, the higher structural disorder close to CBM increases the potential barriers that constrain the movement of free carriers, making the E F shifting above CBM \nharder, as mentioned in the previous point. The trends verifi ed for In/(In + Zn) in Figure 11 can also be observed in Figure 12 , for fi xed In/(In + Ga) atomic ratios (compare GIZO 2:2:1 with 2:2:2), although to a smaller extend than in gallium-free \n\n![8_image_0.png](8_image_0.png)\n\nREVIEW\nmaterials, since the properties start to be essentially dominated by the gallium content when this element is present. \n\n Naturally, all the compositional effects also depend on the remaining processing parameters and so the specifi c results presented here for a particular composition should not be taken as an entirely strict rule: in fact, a large number of reports regarding stable TFTs with close to 0 V ON exist in the literature, for compositions around 2:2:2 and 2:2:1. [72,284,285] Nevertheless, the overall trends verifi ed here for IZO [286–288] and GIZO [58,60,289–\n291] devices were also verifi ed by other authors. \n\n Despite that the increase of V G above V ON leads invariably to the enhancement of µFE , as predicted by conventional fi eldeffect theory, the transconductance (hence µFE ) is changed in different ways, depending on the composition and structure of the oxide semiconductor material. **Figure** 14 illustrates this for GIZO 2:4:2 (amorphous) and ZnO (polycrystalline) TFTs, both having semiconductor layers deposited with % O 2 = 0.4% and subjected to T A = 150 ° C. Given that the PECVD SiO 2 has a high breakdown voltage, the V G range is extended for both cases in order to see all the µFE *–V* G regimes.\n\n For the GIZO TFT (Figure 14 a) an almost abrupt increase of µFE is verifi ed after V ON , given the small S . Physically, E F is raised very quickly above CBM by V G , since the trap density is very low and very large µFE can be achieved when the small potential \n\n![9_image_0.png](9_image_0.png)\n\nbarriers associated with structural disorder are surpassed, which happens for V G ≈ 20–30 V, where µFE is maximum. \n\nAs V G gets higher than these values, the conductive channel is drawn closer to the GIZO/SiO 2 interface, which contributes to increased scattering effects of the large density of induced charges, resulting in a decrease of µFE . \n\n[26] An electron injection barrier at the source electrode may also contribute for this drop in µFE , as proposed by Dehuff et al. [52] A considerably different µFE *–V* G trend is observed for the ZnO TFT (Figure 14 b). For this case the increase of µFE with V G occurs gradually, essentially due to the polycrystalline structure of ZnO with small grain sizes, hence large density of grain boundaries. Some models describe quite well the behaviour of polycrystalline TFTs, namely the one proposed by Levinson in 1982 [292] and more recently the one of Hossain, specifi cally oriented for ZnO TFTs. [39] From these models it can be seen that the barrier height associated with the depletion regions at the grain boundaries is modulated by the total N , which has contributions both from the background N\nand from the charges induced by V G . Furthermore, for smaller grain sizes the width of the depletion regions can extend deep inside the crystallites and even overlap with adjacent depletion regions, resulting in very high ρ . For the ZnO TFTs presented in Figure 14 b) the modulation of these effects by V G should be dominant and overshadow ZnO/SiO 2 interface scattering, even if V G is increased up to 100 V. Although measured in a smaller V G range, Nishii et al. also obtained a similar µFE *–V* G\ntrend in ZnO TFTs. [35] For a large V G range, saturation (and even decreasing) of mobility is observed by Hoffman for V G > 70 V, \non ZnO TFTs produced on thermal SiO 2 . \n\n[40] Still, note that mobility is extracted by Hoffman using a different methodology, designated by incremental mobility, which probes the mobility of carriers as they are incrementally added to the channel, rather than averaging the mobility of all the carriers present in the channel for a given V G . \n\n[40] In fact, by using the more conventional \"average mobility\", physically similar to µFE , mobility saturation is not achieved in Hoffman's paper. By plotting µinc *–V* G for the data depicted in Figure 14 b, saturation is still not obtained, which can be due to different ZnO processing conditions (plausible given the considerably higher µFE achieved by Hoffman) \nand also to the effect of I G that for the present PECVD SiO 2 starts to increase considerably for V G > 70 V. \n\n Some comments should also be made regarding the other polycrystalline binary compound, In 2 O 3 . If the devices employing this semiconductor are annealed at a higher T A to allow for complete crystallization, such as T A = 300 ° C, intermediate properties to those observed in Figures 14 a and b are observed. Although grain boundaries can still affect the movement of the free carriers, their effect should be considerably smaller, given the larger grain size and larger N of this material. Hence, in the unbiased state, most of the traps associated with grain boundaries can be compensated by the background N , leaving more of the V G\ninduced charges available to increase the transconductance. 4.3. Electrical Stress Measurements Stress measurements are crucial to understand instability mechanisms on devices as well as to predict if the technology is suitable to be used in integrated circuits. Hence, the dependence of Adv. *Mater.* 2012, 24**, 2945–2986**\nWAIVAR\n\n![10_image_1.png](10_image_1.png)\n\nGIZO composition on the electrical stability of oxide TFTs under gate-bias stress measurements was also studied, for GIZO layers with%O 2 = 0.4% and T A = 150 °C (Figure 15). Stress measurements were carried out by applying a constant V G = 20 V during 5 h, while keeping the source and drain electrodes grounded.\n\nAs happens with other semiconductor technologies [293–295]\nreversible charge trapping at or close to the dielectric/semiconductor interface, resulting in a shift of V T ( ΔV T ), is the most frequent instability mechanism [222,296–300] The same is verified here, with 2:2:2 and 2:2:1 GIZO compositions resulting in the most unstable devices, as would be predictable given the larger ∆ V ON\nand hysteresis verified for these compositions. As mentioned in 4.2, as the ratio of In/(In+Zn+Ga) starts to decrease, higher structural disorder appears close to the CBM, which can give rise to trap states that degrade the stability. Nevertheless, regardless of composition, the initial properties can be recovered some hours after stress without any subsequent annealing treatment, which is consistent with conventional charge trapping mechanisms rather than defect state creation or ionic drift [30,299,301,302] Note that the devices analyzed to compose Figure 15 were fabricated by employing the oxide semiconductor deposition conditions yielding the most stable devices. If these conditions or other device materials (such as the dielectric layer) are changed, a subsequent annealing treatment might be required to recover the initial properties of the transistors. [277,303]\nDespite GIZO 2:4:1 and 2:4:2 compositions provide the best performing and more stable transistors, device stability can be greatly improved using a passivation layer on top of GIZO. In fact, different authors reported both improved stability (e.g. [298,301,304,305] ) and process yield (e.g. [107] ) when using proper passivation layers on oxide TFTs.\n\n## 4.4. Effect Of Passivation Layer\n\nFigure 16 shows the transfer characteristics obtained for GIZO\nTs having different passivation layers, deposited using\n\n![10_image_0.png](10_image_0.png)\n\ndifferent techniques: SiO 2 by e-beam evaporation and sputtering; MgF 2 by e-beam evaporation and SU-8 by spin-coating.\n\nThe results can be understood by investigating the effects occurring at the air-exposed surface of GIZO. In a non-passivated oxide semiconductor oxygen is physisorbed at the back surface, creating acceptor-like surface states that attract electrons from the semiconductor, giving rise to a depletion region in the semiconductor that can even extend from the air-exposed surface to the dielectric/semiconductor interface. If a passivation layer is placed on top of the air-exposed surface, oxygen adsorption is inhibited, and depending on the passivation material and its deposition technique, an accumulation layer can even be formed at the semiconductor/passivation interface for instance, if metal cation-oxygen bonds are broken during deposition [74,306,307] or if the passivation layer has a large density of positive charges. Based on this background, vacuum deposition techniques (e-beam and sputtering) result on the largest negative shifts of V ON after passivation, since some oxygen from GIZO's back surface can be removed during pump down time.\n\nAdditionally, the intense substrate bombardment occurring during sputtering can break weak metal cation- oxygen bonds, generating oxygen vacancies that increase N . This was in fact observed by different authors when exposing a GIZO surface to reactive ion etching (RIE) or to N 2 and NH 3 plasma treatments.[72,306,308] Hence, the biggest variations occurring after passivation are verified for sputtered SiO 2 , then for e-beam SiO 2 and MgF 2 . The effect of T A = 300 °C is also shown for MgF 2 , being possible to switch off the transistors for V G < − 7.5 V.\n\nDespite the largely negative V ON , MgF 2 passivated devices also exhibit a negative shift of V ON in consecutive transfer characteristics measurements, as well as counter clockwise hysteresis, suggesting that ionic drift mechanisms can be present in the device.[30,309,310]\nSU-8, an epoxy-based negative chemically amplified resist that is commonly used for the fabrication of high aspect ratio features, [311] provides the best device performance. To a large extent, this can be justified by the non-vacuum deposition technique (spin- coating), without physical substrate bombardment.\n\n![11_image_0.png](11_image_0.png)\n\nEven if SU-8 passivated TFTs without a subsequent annealing process exhibit a large negative V ON ( ≈ − 10 V), the performance is significantly improved after T A = 200 °C. At this stage, cross-linking of the SU-8 layer is fully achieved (confirmed by FTIR analysis) and remaining H + ions available at the passivation layer (due to the decomposition of the photoacid generator present in SU-8), close to its interface with GIZO, can probably capture some electrons from GIZO, re-establishing a depletion layer close to the back surface of GIZO.\n\nSU-8 passivation also provides a remarkable improvement on the stability of the devices, as shown in Figure 17, where results for constant I D stress measurements for passivated and non-passivated devices are plotted.\n\nA small and recoverable ΔV T = 0.46 V could be obtained after 24h of stress at I D = 10 µ A for the SU-8 passivated GIZO TFTs.\n\nThe improvement over non-passivated devices should again be related with the GIZO's back surface, where a barrier is formed by the passivation layer, inhibiting oxygen adsorption/desorption processes that are known to be potentiated when ZnO-\nbased materials are subjected to electric fields. [313] On the contrary, in non-passivated devices, oxygen can be adsorbed as the stress measurement progresses, widening the depletion layer close to the back surface and raising V T . Improvements on the stability of passivated oxide TFTs are also reported in literature, for instance by Cho et al. and Levy et al [298,304]\n\n## 4.5. Effect Of Dielectric Material\n\nThe stability and overall performance of a TFT also depend to a great extent on the dielectric layer. The results presented above refer to an optimized PECVD SiO 2 process at 400 °C,\nbut if low-temperature electronics are envisaged, alternative dielectrics and/or processing techniques need to be used.\n\nChemically deposited organic dielectrics are being investigated for oxide TFTs with very promising results, but generally their growing and/or curing process is slow and/or requires high\n\n## Ww.Materialsvie\n\ntemperatures [314,315] Physical routes like sputtering are another possibility for low-temperature dielectric fabrication, but generally the low sputtering rates of dielectrics requires the usage of highly- energetic deposition processes (for instance, high power and/or low deposition pressure) that can negatively affect the growing films and their interfaces. Hence, materials with a high dielectric constant (high- κ ) are preferable, given that the increased capacitance can compensate the higher density of interface traps, decreasing S and the operating voltage.[30] Still, most of the high- κ dielectrics present at least two issues that can degrade performance and stability of oxide TFTs: (i) hey exhibit a polycrystalline structure and a rough surface, which can contribute to reduced reliability, since grain boundaries act as preferential paths for impurities diffusion and leakage current, and degraded interface properties[ 30 , 316 ] and (ii) high- κ dielectrics generally have lower E G and smaller band offsets relatively to the semiconductor than conventional SiO 2 or SiN 2 :H, leading to a low breakdown voltage and high leakage current ( IG ). [ 317 ]\nMulticomponent and/or stack dielectrics, composed by mixtures of high- κ (e.g. Ta 2 O 5 or HfO 2 [318,319] and high- E G (e.g.\n\nSiO 2 or Al 2 O 3 ) have been studied to solve these issues. Most of these materials can remain amorphous even at temperatures exceeding 500 °C, preserving an overall high- κ and improving the band offsets relatively to the semiconductor. Some relevant results regarding the integration of multicomponent/stack dielectric with oxide semiconductor technology are provided in ref [81]\nAt CENIMAT]I3N we have been studying both Ta- and Hfbased dielectrics for integration with GIZO TFTs. Figure 18 shows transfer characteristics of GIZO TFTs employing sputtered SiO 2 , Ta 2 O 5 and co-sputtered Ta 2 O 5 -SiO 2 (denoted as TSiO) dielectrics, being the final devices annealed at 150 °C.[303]\nSputtered SiO 2 results in poor overall device performance, with a low µ FE (≈ 1 cm² V− 1 s− 1 ) and high S (≈ 1 V dec− 1 ). Even if Ta₂O 5 can provide considerably improved performance, its low E G and poor band offset relatively to GIZO result in a low yield/reproducibility and large off- currents. By using co- sputtered TSiO a\n\n![11_image_2.png](11_image_2.png)\n\n![11_image_1.png](11_image_1.png)\n\nwileyonlinelibrary.com WELVER\n\n## Ww.Materialsviews.Com\n\ngood compromise between the lower off- current of SiO 2 and lower S and higher µ FE of Ta 2 O5 are obtained.\n\nBut even with TSiO, a narrow band offset is obtained with GIZO, making the reliability and reproducibility of GIZO TFTs using this dielectric an issue, being frequent to find in one substrate several devices with shorted-gates or, in less extreme cases, devices with large electrical properties variations, namely in their off -current. Hence, even if some TSiO-based TFTs can sustain repeated and severe stress tests, such as constant I D =\n10 µ A during 24h, [303] multilayer dielectrics composed by TSiO\nstacked between two thin layers (≈20 nm) of SiO 2 (denoted by S-TS-S) are being investigated. Even if hysteresis is slightly increased for the multilayer structures when compared with TSiO (mostly due to the non-optimized SiO 2 /GIZO interface),\nthe reproducibility, reliability and overall transistor performance are significantly improved by using the multilayer structure\n(Figure 19). This is due to the fact that the material in contact with GIZO is now a high - E G dielectric with a large conduction band offset with GIZO and also due the existence of discontinuities or interfaces between the different layers composing the dielectric that prevent the easy flowing of charges through the overall structure. For these devices, μ FE = 12.7 cm 2 V- 1 s- 1 , V ON =\n−0.4 V, on/off = 3 × 10 8 and S = 0.20 V dec − 1 are obtained. The dominant instability mechanism on these devices appears to be charge trapping at or close to the dielectric/semiconductor interface, resulting in a reversible ∆ V T ≈ 5 V after 12 h with I D\n= 10 µ A.\n\nA multilayer approach was also used to improve the properties of Hf-based dielectrics. GIZO TFTs employing HfO 2 dielectric exhibit a sharp increase of I G for V G > 5 V (Figure 20a). The small range of usable V c and lack of reliability/reproducibility of HfO 2 -based TFTs might be associated with the higher bombardment effects during film growth (higher P rf than Ta 2 O 5 ),\nwhich can broaden the band-tails and decrease the band-offsets with GIZO, and also with the polycrystalline structure of sputtered HfO 2 films. But similarly to what was observed for tantalum-based dielectrics, a multilayer stack with a HfO 2 -SiO 2 layer between two thin layers of SiO 2 (overall stack denoted by S-HS-S) results in considerably improved electrical properties, with a very low I G that allows obtaining on/off exceeding 10 9 .\n\nBesides that, S-HS-S-based TFTs exhibit µ FE = 17.0 cm 2 V − 1 s − 1 ,\nV ON = 1.2 V and S = 0.22 V dec − 1 . Although the ∆ V T under constant I D stress measurements is higher than for transistors with S-TS-S, charge trapping is again the only significant instability mechanism verified, being the initial properties of the devices fully recoverable after 48h recovery time (Figure 20b).\n\nAn improvement of performance and stability of oxide TFTs with hafnium-based multilayer dielectrics was also verified by Chang et al. and Lee et al., [219,320,321] by showing that ZnO TFTs employing an Al 2 O 3 /HfO 2 /Al 2 O 3 dielectric exhibit a considerable suppression of charge trapping, traduced in lower hysteresis and lower ∆ V T than similar TFTs with HfO 2 .\n\n## 4.6. Solution-Based Tfts\n\nFollowing Moore's law the number of transistors per microelectronic chip has doubled every 18 months. Nevertheless the cost of a chip per unit of area has remained relatively static\n\n![12_image_0.png](12_image_0.png)\n\nfor the last three decades. This leads to the developing of new and inexpensive technologies, like for example printing technologies. Current methods for the production of functional inorganic electronic devices are based on the sequential deposition, patterning, and etching of selected semiconducting, conducting, and insulating materials. These sequential processes generally involve multiple photolithography and vacuum-deposition processes, which contribute to their high manufacturing costs. Direct printing of inorganic materials offers the possibility of depositing thin films using a direct additive patterning processes that enables the fabrication of high-performance and ultralow-cost electronics.\n\nEVIEW\n\n![13_image_0.png](13_image_0.png)\n\nAlthough many soluble organic semiconductors have been explored for this purpose, their functional performance generally falls short of expectation, in addition to other process issues. Low mobility, low current density, process-dependent performance variations and reliability issues are among the critical deficiencies with these materials, turning them inappropriate for applications like for example TFTs for active matrix backplanes for displays. On the other hand, inorganic semiconductors are the basis for almost all-high performance microelectronic devices. For example they can have intrinsic mobilities of ~1000 cm 2 V −1 s −1 , with lifetimes over 50 years and clock speeds beyond 1 GHz.\n\nInk-jet printing of inorganic materials for the formation of active devices is relatively new compared to the research done with respect to organic materials. To date, only a handful of inorganic materials have been ink-jet printed, primarily because of the difficulty in preparing ink- jet- printable precursors. Printing of functional inorganic materials is a challenging task with respect to processability and materials performance, materials are applied only where desired and it is a non-contact process, the print nozzles do not contact the substrate, preserving delicate surfaces.\n\nFigure 21 compares the cost reduction between ink-jet and conventional microelectronic technologies, where a reduction of 64% is achieved by using for example direct printing.\n\nThe first efforts to print an electronic device backs to 1967, when Sihvonen et al. [322] inspired by the recent work reported by Weimer, has demonstrated the possibility to make an insulated gate field effect transistor (he call them Graphic Active Devices– GAD's ) with all the materials printed: semiconductor based on CdS:CdSe inks; dielectric based on silicate cements and electrodes based on a Hg:In paste-like. Although these preliminary results were not spectacular (see Figure 22), this work can be considered as a landmark in the printed electronics history.\n\nPrinted electronics is today an emerging disruptive technology which has made an impressive progress specially in the last 10 years, in particular for: (i) the field-effect mobility of solution-processed organic TFTs has increased to levels exceeding those of amorphous silicon TFTs (~1 cm 2 V-1 s-1);[19,323,324] (ii) the performance of polymer LEDs is surpassing that of fluorescent tubes[ 325 ] and (iii) the efficiency of printed organic solar cells is reaching levels of 5–8% [ 326 ]\nInk-jet of inorganic materials for making active devices was relatively rare compared to organic materials, mainly due to\n\n![14_image_0.png](14_image_0.png)\n\n[322]).\n\n![14_image_1.png](14_image_1.png)\n\nthe difficulty in preparing ink-jet printable precursors. [327] Some efforts have been done in the last five years and basically two main routes have been followed: nanoparticles and molecular precursor approach. Concerning the coating method for a solution process the most used are: spin- coating; printing (ink- jet, micro contact, among others) and chemical bath deposition (see Figure 23).\n\nConcerning the nanoparticle approach, usually the devices present some instability due to the large surface area of the nanoparticles. In opposition, the molecular precursors approach has the advantage of mixing different metal precursors in the same solution.\n\nAlthough the possibility to deposit inorganic semiconducting films directly from a solution to achieve high levels of device performance was already reported in 2001 by Ohya et al., [328] it is still challenging to obtain high mobility semiconductor layers at low temperatures. In their work the TFT mobility was 0.2 cm 2 V − 1 s − 1 and the on/off ratio was 10 7 ,\nbut for a very high T A , in the order of 900 °C. More recently, Adamapoulos et al. [329–331] succeed to increase the channel mobility of Li-doped ZnO TFTs processed at a temperature of 400 °C for values higher than 85 cm 2 V 21 s 21 using ambient spray pyrolysis and blends of precursor solutions based on zinc and lithium acetates (Figure 24). They use a bottom gate configuration and a high/ κ dielectric based on ZrO 2 oxide layer also deposited by spray pyrolysis. Despite the fact that the semiconductor channel layer is not patterned, which in some cases over estimates the channel mobility,[332,333] these results evidence the potentialities of a very simple and low cost technology for device and circuit applications, whose main bottleneck is still the process temperature that limits the type of substrates that can be used.

[335,336] where they report NP-GIZO TFTs using the hydrothermal method (180 °C @ 10 atm) to transform a solution type metal hydroxide into an oxide nanoparticle gel. After dispersing and spin coating the solution a post-bake at 95 °C was used. They got mobilities of 7.65 cm 2 V − 1 s − 1 .\n\nand on/off ratios of 10 7 . In the same year Nayak et al.[337] present high performance a-GIZO TFTs obtained by sol-gel spin coating technique. A µ FE = 5.8 cm 2 V − 1 s − 1 (µ x,t =\n9.6 cm 2 V − 1 s − 1 ) with an on/off ratio of 5 × 10 7 and subthreshold swing of 0.28 V dec − 1 were obtained.\n\nSo far, these methodologies have focused on the use of metal acetates, nitrates and halides in coordinating solvents and generally they require elevated temperatures, usually higher than 400 1 C to complete precursor decomposition and avoid undesirable contamination of the semiconductor, which is incompatible with the use of plastic substrates and in some cases due to the different thermal expansion coefficients cracking could occur. Taking this into account, Banger et al. [338] have recently discovered a novel precursor approach to obtain ternary and quaternary oxide semiconductors, that is based on the use of organic-inorganic metal alkoxide precursors able to produce dense amorphous films. This approach allowed demonstrating for the first time solution-processed films of InZnO and InGaZnO that have comparable electronic performance as sputtered films, i.e., mobilities ~10 cm 2 V 21 s −1 and similar threshold voltage stability with process temperatures as low as 230 °C (see Figure 26).\n\nThis so called \"sol-gel on chip\" method allows controlled low-temperature processing a from metal alkoxide precursors that, without mediated hydrolysis, decompose only at higher temperatures.\n\nIn 2011 Kim et al.[339] succeed to produce In 2 O 3 , ZTO and IZO TFIs by solution process at a temperature as low as 200 °C by using a clever and new self-energy generating combustion chemistry. The main advantage of this technique is the possibility to perform the chemical reactions at a much lower temperature since the precursor is optimized wileyonlinelibrary.com rialsViews.com\n\n![16_image_1.png](16_image_1.png)\n\nTable 2b.

In this way the oxide formation is done at low heating temperatures, which leads to the complete removal of organic constituents.\n\nThe self-generated heat of synthesis provides a localized energy supply (similar to a laser annealing), eliminating the need for high, externally applied processing temperatures\n(see schematics in Figure 27).

However, until now there is no report about p-type oxide TFTs with performance similar to that of n-type oxide TFTs. P-type oxide TFTs are mainly limited by the low hole mobilities since the mobility of valence band derived carriers is generally lower than that of conduction band derived carriers, as in the case of n-type conductivity. In fact comparing to what happened in organic TFTs we are facing exactly the same but in an opposite WAIVAR\n\n| Year   |\n|--------|\n| 2009   |\n| 2009   |\n| 2009   |\n| 2009   |\n| 2009   |\n| 2009   |\n| 2010   |\n| 2010   |\n| 2010   |\n| 2010   |\n| 2010   |\n| 2010   |\n| 2010   |\n| 2010   |\n| 2010   |\n| 2011   |\n| 2011   |\n| 2011   |\n| 2011   |\n| 2011   |\n| 2011   |\n| 2011   |\n| 2011   |\n| 2011   |\n| 2011   |\n\nREVIEW\n\n![17_image_0.png](17_image_0.png)\n\n![17_image_1.png](17_image_1.png)\n\n![17_image_2.png](17_image_2.png)\n\nway, since most of organic TFTs reported in the literature are p-type [403–406] while the oxide ones are n-type. Organic materials have been studied for more than 50 years and the significant improvements in the semiconducting properties associated to the discovery of electroluminescence in organic diode structures make these materials as excellent candidates for low-cost electronic and optoelectronic structures. [407,408] One of the main advantages of organic materials are the low temperature fabrication which allow lightweight flexible displays. Even though organic TFTs have been the topic of intense research for the past few decades, the overall performance parameters are still poor compared to oxide materials, namely the low mobilities\n(< 2 cm 2 V − 1 s − 1 )[ 409 ] poor stability and device-to-device variability as well as improved performance, processability, and environmental stability to oxygen and moisture. Moreover, the n-type organic semiconductors have much lower mobilities (10 –2 to 10 –1 cm 2 V –1 s –1 1 [323,410–412] limiting their field of applications, such as in CMOS.\n\n![18_image_0.png](18_image_0.png)\n\n![18_image_1.png](18_image_1.png)\n\nAchieving high performance p-type oxide TFTs (that have an advantage over n-type TFTs since the TFT supplies hole current for the anode of the organic light emitting device [OLED]\nwithout affecting the drain current in the saturation mode) will definitely promote a new era for electronics in rigid and flexible substrates, away from silicon. Moreover, it will shape the electronics of tomorrow by allowing the production of complementary metal oxide semiconductors (CMOS), a key device to fuel the microelectronics revolution in the so-called technologies of information and communication, by allowing the use of highly compact circuits with low power consumption.\n\nAt present, almost all reported oxide TFTs are based on n-channel devices. [20,278] For p-type oxides, carrier conduction path (valence band) is mainly formed from the oxygen p asymmetric orbitals, which severely limit the carrier mobility. So, p-type oxides have very low carrier mobility compared to their n-type counterparts, which is the main obstacle in obtaining high performance p- channel oxide TFTs. Recently much attention has been given to Cu based semiconductors, of which the delafossite family CuMO 2 (M = Al, Ga, In, Y, Sc, La, etc.) is the most important. The simple binary oxides based on ZnO and NiO have also been studied as promising p-type semiconductors, but without relevant results until now.\n\nIn the following sections the discussion will be focused on the present available data on two emergent and promising p-type TFTs based on copper oxide and tin monoxide.\n\n## 4.7.1. Copper Oxide\n\nThe first evidence of the semiconductor properties in a metal oxide was done on copper oxide, more precisely Cu 2 O, cuprous oxide, in 1917 by Kennard et al. [413] (Figure 30a). Solid-state devices based on Cu 2 O semiconductors are known for more than 90 years even before the era of germanium and silicon devices. Rectifier diodes based on this semiconductor were used industrially as early as 1926[414] (Figure 30b) and most of the theory of semiconductors was developed using the data on Cu 2 O devices. [415–417]\nOxides of copper are known to show p-type conductivity and are attracting renewed interest as promising semiconductor materials for a wide range of optoelectronic devices. There are two common forms of copper oxide: cuprous oxide or cuprite (Cu 2 O) and cupric oxide or tenorite (CuO). Figure 31 shows a comparison between these two compounds in terms of optical properties and crystal structure.\n\nBoth the CuO (monoclinic) and Cu 2 O (cubic) are p-type semiconductors with a band gap of 1.9–2.1 and 2.1–2.6 eV respectively [418] and in some experimental conditions Cu 2 O\nshows mobilities exceeding 100 cm 2 V − 1 s − 1 [419–422] Besides that, Cu 2 O was regarded as one of the most promising materials for application in solar cells[28,423,424] due to its high-absorption coefficient in the visible region, non- toxicity, abundant availability, and low-cost production. [425] The potential for solar cell application have been recognized since 1920, nevertheless at that time and until the beginning of space explorations, the energy production from the sun by photovoltaic effect was just a curiosity.\n\nThe p-type character of Cu 2 O is attributed to the presence of negatively charged copper vacancies (V Cu ), which introduce an acceptor level at about 0.3 eV above the valence band\n\nREVIEW\n\n![19_image_0.png](19_image_0.png)\n\nby recovery in the dark but lagging by 2–3 minutes (adapted from **[413]** **);** \nb) Example of the fi rst rectifi er assembly. A is oxidized surface of copper strip; C is the piece of lead used for contact; B is mica insulation; and F is terminal connected to mother copper (adapted from [414]). \n(V B ). [426] It was also proposed by some authors a co-existence of both intrinsic, acceptor and donor levels with a ratio slightly larger than 1 and less than 10. [427,428] The nature of the donor levels is not completely clear being even controversial, where the simplest candidates are oxygen vacancies. [429] In contrast to the majority of metal oxides, in which the top of V B is mainly formed from localized and anisotropic O 2p orbitals which leads to a low hole mobility due to hopping conduction, here the top of the V B is composed of fully occupied hybridized orbitals (Cu 3d and O 2p) with Cu d sates dominating the top of the V B . \n\n[430] **Figure** 32 a illustrates the chemical bond between an oxide ion and a cation that has a closed-shell electronic confi guration; Figure 32 b shows a pictorial representation of the most important defects in Cu 2 O and Figure 32 c reveals the simple electronic model proposed by Brattain, [427] consisting of a compensated semiconductor with one acceptor level at 0.3 eV and a deep donor level at 0.9 eV from V B .\n\n High quality Cu 2 O thin fi lms have been grown by several methods, like sputtering, [432–435] pulsed laser deposition, [436–438]\n2964 wileyonlinelibrary.com © **2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim**\ntemperatures. This characteristic has impeded the application of Cu in integrated circuits. However, the high oxidation rate of Cu and high reduction rate of its oxides at low temperature can be exploited for some potential applications, as we will present in this paper. \n\n Despite the high quality of CuO thin fi lms with mobilities it has been diffi cult to produce TFTs with high channel mobilities. TFTs prepared from Cu 2 O have shown very poor performance (fi eld-effect mobilities and on/off current ratio were below 1 cm 2 V − 1 s − 1 and 10 2 respectively), mainly because of the diffi culty of controlling the hole density in the channel layer. [431]\n Generally in order to achieve high quality Cu 2 O thin fi lms the depositions involve high substrate temperatures, which is always higher than 500 ° C. Recently it was shown by Li et al. [419] that it is possible to grow high quality Cu 2 O thin fi lms by reactive magnetron sputtering using a Cu target at temperatures in the order of 200 ° C followed by a thermal treatment of 600 ° C. In this work the authors found that with the introduction of a buffer layer the crystallinity increases associated to an increase in the grain size and under oxygen optimum growing conditions they achieved mobilities in the order of 256 cm 2 V − 1 s − 1 with a hole concentration of 10 14 cm − 3 as it is shown in **Figure** 33 . \n\n One of the fi rst reports on p-type oxide based TFTs was proposed by the Wager's group using as channel layer a CuZnO x Adv. *Mater.* 2012, 24**, 2945–2986**\nMALVEN\n\n![20_image_0.png](20_image_0.png)\n\n![20_image_1.png](20_image_1.png)\n\nsemiconductor [30] (Figure 34). This device shows poor performance with a very high ON voltage ( ≈ 60 V) and a low channel mobility (≈0.01 cm 2 V − 1 s − 1 ). Since V ON is so large, the pinch-off condition was not achieved so that this device exhibits a \"soft\" saturation. Other detrimental features of this device include requiring an extremely high post- deposition annealing temperature of 800 °C which limits the use of low cost substrates and the fact that the channel layer is not completely transparent.\n\nIn the same year Matsuzaki et al. [420] reported TFT using single phase Cu 2 O films grown by pulsed laser deposition at\n\n![20_image_2.png](20_image_2.png)\n\n700 °C on MgO substrates. Even though the hole mobility was very high (~90 cm 2 V − 1 s − 1 ), the performance of the integrated Ts were quite moderate (Figure 35). They have obtained mobilities of 0.26 cm 2 V 2 s − 1 and an on/off ratio lower than one order of magnitude. In order to investigate the origin of the obtained poor mobility, they subject the films to a post-deposition annealing under various oxygen partial pressures.[ 449 ] From optical measurements it was revealed that subgap states exist in all the films and their amounts were increased by post deposition annealing irrespective to the oxygen partial pressure used.\n\nThese subgap states were observed even for the best film with an estimated defect density >10 18 cm −3 . This value explains consistently the small field-effect mobility observed in these Cu 2 O\nTFTs. The types of defects are mainly oxygen vacancies and the appearance of the CuO phase.\n\nTwo years later in 2010 Fortunato et al. [431] demonstrated the possibility to produce p-type transparent oxide semiconductors based on Cu 2 O by reactive magnetron sputtering at REVIEW\n\n![21_image_1.png](21_image_1.png)\n\nroom temperature followed by a thermal treatment at 200 °C. The Cu 2 O films are polycrystalline presenting a strong orientation along the (111) plane. After annealing in air at 200 °C\nfor 10 hours, the Hall mobility was improved from 0.65 to 18.5 cm 2 V − 1 s − 1 , which is associated with an increase of the grain size, from 8.30 to 15.72 nm. Concerning the optical properties, the p-type films present Eop ≈ 2.34 eV and the films have an average transmittance around 85%, between 400 and 2000 nm for a thickness of 40 nm. Bottom gate p-type TFTs with Cu 2 O channel layer present a µ FE ≈ 1.2 × 10 − 3 cm 2 V − 1 s − 1 , an on/off modulation ratio of 2 × 10 2 and a V T of –12.0 V as indicated in Figure 36.\n\nAlso in 2010 Sung et al. [450] have produced Cu 2 O thin films deposited at room temperature using rf magnetron sputtering.\n\nFor annealing temperatures higher than 200 °C a transformation to a CuO phase is observed. The obtained optical bandgaps of the Cu 2 O and CuO were 2.44 and 1.41 eV, respectively.\n\nBottom gate structured TFTs fabricated using CuO layers operated in a p-type enhancement mode with an on/off ratio of ≈ 10 4 and field-effect mobility of 0.4 cm 2 V − 1 s − 1 (Figure 37).\n\nThe paper from Zou et al [451] presented p-type TFTs based on CuO and Cu 2 O with improved properties and in particular a mobility and on/off ratio of 4.3 cm 2 V − 1 s − 1 and 3 × 10 6 respectively, which re-opens the study on this semiconductor with almost 100 years. The films were grown on SiO 2 /Si substrate by pulsed laser deposition under different substrate temperatures using a top-gate structure with a high- κ HfON as gate dielectric. The improved TFT mobility results from the decreased scattering of both the ionized defects and the grain boundary for Cu 2 O channel films, which is also revealed by the low subthreshold, swing of 0.18 V dec − 1 (Figure 38).\n\nTable 3 summarizes the results achieved on p-type oxide TFTs as reported in the literature, concerning the technique, the deposition/annealed temperature, substrate/dielectric material, channel mobility and on/off ratio.\n\nThe obtained values for the channel mobility are much lower than that of the corresponding films, indicating that a high density of traps exists in the film channel or/and the channel/gate dielectric interface. Thus, trap states were still formed even in the high mobility films independent of the impurity phases.\n\n![21_image_0.png](21_image_0.png)\n\nWe consider that extra trap states would be formed by slight nonstoichiometry of Cu 2 O or induced by the device fabrication process, e.g., by ion bombardment and/or plasma reduction during deposition of the other device layers.\n\nNevertheless, Cu 2 O is a promising channel material for p-type oxide TFTs in the future. It is expected that further improvements on the electrical properties of the Cu 2 O TFTs can be obtained if the device structure and processing conditions are optimized. The low temperature process combined with the good electrical performance of the devices at this early research stage opens new doors for the future optimization of p-type oxide-based devices and for their integration in CMOS\nstructures allowing their use in flexible, low cost and transparent electronic circuits. As it was written by Wager in his book Transparent Electronics:[ 30 ] \"The development of robust p-type semiconductors for use as channel materials in TFTs remains a considerable challenge, where considerable material development in needed before high performance devices can be realized.\"\nBesides the physical techniques mentioned in the description above I would like to emphasize that, low cost p-type TFTs based on Cu 2 O can be produced. Figueiredo et al. deposited thin films of Cu by e-beam evaporation at room temperature [425] followed by thermal oxidation at different temperatures in air. They WALVES\n\n![22_image_1.png](22_image_1.png)\n\nfound that the cubic Cu phase of the as deposited films changes into single cubic Cu 2 O phase for annealing temperatures below 30 ° C and changes to monoclinic CuO phase at higher temperatures, which is in accordance with previous results. [454,455]\nThe films with dominating Cu 2 O phase show p-type conductivity. Based on these results a p-type TFT was produced and the preliminary results are presented in Figure 39.\n\nThe poor electrical properties obtained for these TFTs are related to the several micro-structural defects that occur during oxidation. The Cu ions migrate from Cu toward oxygen/Cu 2 O\ninterface with the formation of a porous layer. 1456 This was con-\n\n![22_image_0.png](22_image_0.png)\n\nfirmed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) for an oxidized film and a Cu 2 O film grown by rf magnetron sputtering, where the surface roughness increases from 4.6 nm to 18.2 nm (Figure 40).\n\nAnother example using thermal oxidation of copper was presented by Han et al. [457] where a Cu wire is used for making a Cu 2 O-Cu field effect transistor as it is indicated in Figure 41.\n\nThe inner core Cu wire and outer shell Cu 2 O film were used for the gate and channel respectively, and a Schottky barrier at Cu/Cu 2 O was used for gate diode in the metal semiconductor field effect transistor. This particular cylindrical layout of the device can play the role of a fibber of the textile and the transistor therefore can serve as the fundamental building block for future e-textile.\n\n## 4.7.2. Tin Monoxide\n\nTin oxides are known to be wide band gap oxide semiconductors and are present into two well- known forms: tin monoxide SnO and tin dioxide SnO 2 . SnO 2 (and impurity doped SnO 2 )\nis a typical functional material with multiple applications including transparent conducting oxides, [458,459] low emission windows coatings[ 460 ] and solid state gas sensing material [ 461 ]\nIn contrast, the physical properties of SnO have not been well explored. SnO 2 has a tetragonal structure and the unit cell contains two tin and four oxygen atoms. Each tin atom is at the centre of six oxygen atoms placed approximately at the corners of a regular octahedron, while each oxygen atom is surrounded by three tin atoms at the corners of an equilateral triangle.

These defects are generally due to oxygen vacancies or interstitial tin atoms and are responsible for making electrons available at the conduction band.\n\nIn the past decades, due to its technological applications SnO have been used in a variety of applications like: anode materials for lithium rechargeable batteries. [462,463] coatings, [464] catalysts for several acids[465] and precursor for the production of SnO 2 . [466] Recently, SnO has been received a\n\n![23_image_2.png](23_image_2.png)\n\nparticular attention because of the difficulty in obtaining stable and high quality p-type semiconductors based on ZnO,[467]\nNiO[468,469] and Cu2O.[470] It was demonstrated by Togo et al.[471]\nthe p-type conductivity of SnO mainly originates from Sn vacancies.\n\nTFTs based on p-type SnO x are expected to fulfill these requirements due to the particular nature of band structure. Contributions from Sn 5s states to valence band maxima\n(VBM) could offer appreciable hole mobility in this material, without using a high processes temperature. The comparison between the band structure of SnO 2 and SnO is prex: 1.00 µm sented in Figure 43. In the case of SnO the top of the valence band consist of hybridized orbital of O 2p and Sn 5s.\n\nWAIVAR\n\n![24_image_0.png](24_image_0.png)\n\nThe first p-type oxide based TFT was made in 2008 by Ogo et al. [472] using SnO as channel layer. The films were grown epitaxially on (001) yttria-stabilized zirconia at a substrate temperature of 575 °C by pulsed laser deposition. The films exhibit a Hall mobility of 2.4 cm 2 V − 1 s − 1 at room temperature. Top-gate TFTs, using the epitaxial SnO channels, exhibited field-effect mobilities of 1.3 cm 2 V 21 s 21 , on/off current ratios of 10 2 and a threshold voltage of 4.8 V. In Figure 44 we present the output and the transfer characteristics of this TFT. The TFTs operate in the depletion mode. The large off current associated to the depletion mode operation is attributed to the large hole density (>10 17 cm −3 ).\n\n![24_image_1.png](24_image_1.png)\n\nIn the same year two more papers were reported by Ou [473] et al. and Dhanajay et al. [474] SnO, was used for the channel semiconductor, deposited by reactive thermal evaporation at room temperature, followed by a post annealing in air at 100 °C. They used a bottom gate structure with SiO 2 thermally grown on Si wafer as dielectric layer and by tuning the post deposition temperature it is possible to control the electrical performance of the TFTs, specially the threshold voltage.\n\nThe TFTs annealed at 100 °C present an on/off ratio of 10 3 , field effect mobility of 0.011 cm 2 V 2 s 2 1 , a threshold voltage of 30.4 V and subthreshold swing of 2 V dec − 1\n(Figure 45). The interface trap density at the semiconductor/\ndielectric interface obtained for this TFT was 8.1 × 10 11 cm − 2 which is very high, explaining the low value of channel mobility.\n\nThe threshold voltage can be tuned using different post deposition temperature annealing and an inverter structure comprising two SnO 2 TFTs annealed at different temperatures was constructed. The obtained gain was calculated by differentiating the voltage transfer curve and it was found to be around 2.8.\n\nThe same authors have also reported a hybrid complementary inverter composed with a p-SnO 2 and a n-In 2 O 3 TFIs with an output gain of 11. [474]\nIn 2010 several reports on p-type SnO TFTs from Japan, Korea, Portugal and China have been published. Lee et al. [475] reported p-type TFTs by using a tin monoxide film deposited by vacuum thermal evaporation. The as deposited film showed as amorphous phase, and a polycrystalline tin monoxide was obtained by post annealing at 310 °C for 1 h in argon environment. They have fabricated bottom gate, bottom contact structure TFTs on heavily doped silicon wafers with a thermally grown silicon oxide layer. The TFTs performances are moderate, achieving an on/off ratio of 10 2 and a field effect mobility of 4 × 10 − 5 cm 2 V − 1 s − 1 .\n\nIn the same year Liang et al. [476] reported p-type TFTs using amorphous SnO thin films deposited by electron beam\n\n![24_image_2.png](24_image_2.png)\n\nREVIEW\n\n![25_image_0.png](25_image_0.png)\n\n![25_image_1.png](25_image_1.png)\n\nevaporation at room temperature followed by a rapid thermal annealing treatment in an argon atmosphere. Bottom gate TFTs using 100 nm SnO thick as channel layer have been deposited on top of SiO 2 /Si substrates. The subthreshold swing, on/off ratio and field effect mobility are 11 V dec − 1 , 2 × 10 2 , − 3.5 V and 0.87 cm 2 V 21 s 21 respectively (Figure 46).\n\nAnother p-type SnO TFT was reported in the same year by Yabuta et al. [477] Polycrystalline SnO thin films was used for the channel semiconductor by conventional rf sputtering with a subsequent annealing treatment. Bottom gate TFTs were fabricated using as dielectric layer a thin film of SiN x formed by plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition on n + -Si. The Ts exhibit an on/off ratio and field effect mobility of 10 2 and 0.24 cm 2 V 21 s 21 , respectively. The authors have also demonstrated in this report that oxidation of the SnO films decrease hole density and produce n-type SnO 2 .\n\nFortunato et al. reported SnO x TFTs deposited on glass substrate by rf magnetron sputtering at room temperature, followed by a rapid annealing at 200 °C. The SnO films present a polycrystalline structure composed with a mixture of tetragonal β - Sn and α –SnO phases, after annealing at 200 °C. These films exhibit a hole carrier concentration in the range of ≈ 10 16 –10 18 cm − 3 ; \nelectrical resistivity between 10 1 –10 2 Ω cm; Hall mobility around 4.8 cm 2 V − 1 s − 1 ; optical band gap of 2.8 eV and average transmittance ≈ 85% (400 to 2000 nm). Bottom-gate TFTs were fabricated using 30 nm thick α -SnO fi lms as semiconductors, while the gate dielectric was a stacked multilayer of Al 2 O 3 and TiO 2 (ATO) with 220 nm thick deposited on a glass coated with a 200 nm thick Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) fi lm, acting as gate electrode. For the source-drain electrodes Ti/Au (8/50 nm thick) fi lms were e-beam evaporated. The TFTs present a fi eld-effect mobility above 1 cm 2 V − 1 s − 1 and an on/off modulation ratio of 10 3 . More recently by controlling the SnO oxidation state it was possible to obtain TFTs with improved performance: [478] saturation mobility of 4.6 cm 2 V − 1 s − 1 and on/off ratio above 7 × 10 4 , \nwhich are the highest values achieved so far in any p-channel oxide TFT ( **Figure** 47 ).\n\n In order to prove the feasibility of producing p-type oxide TFTs at room or/and low temperature we have produced a p-type paper-transistor using as dielectric layer a fl exible cellulose sheet of conventional paper, based on a new concept \n\"Paper Electronics - Paper-e\" proposed by E. Fortunato et al. in 2008, [2,479,480] where the paper sheet works simultaneously as the substrate and the dielectric layer. \n\nFigures 48 a and b show the I D –V D and | I D –V G| characteristics of a paper p-type SnO transistor after annealing in air at 160 ° C.\n\n The obtained electronic performances of the p-type papertransistor do not differ signifi cantly when the cellulose fi bber is used as dielectric. The main difference is related to the on/off ratio, one order of magnitude lower, mainly related to the fact that cellulose fi bbers have a typically open structure (macroporosity), which limits the off current. \n\nFigure 49 a and b show a photograph and a schematic of the paper transistor, respectively. In Figures 49 c and d we can see a scanning electron microscopy cross-section image of the gate electrode (IZO) deposited on one side of the cellulose paper. We can also observe the good step coverage of the IZO fi lm along the cellulose fi bbers.\n\n In 2011 Nomura et al. [483] report the fi rst ambipolar oxidebased TFT using an SnO channel semiconductor, and its application to a complementary-like inverter combining two ambipolar SnO TFTs. Saturation mobilities of 0.8 and 5 × 10 − 4 cm 2 V − 1 s − 1 are obtained for the p-channel and n-channel modes, respectively, and the inverter shows a maximum voltage gain of 2.5. \n\nThe SnO fi lms have been deposited by pulsed laser deposition at room temperature and bottom gate and top contact structures were fabricated on thermally oxidised SiO 2 /n + Si substrates. The devices were annealed at 250 ° C in air. This result is the fi rst demonstration of a complementary-like circuit using a single oxide semiconductor channel and provides an important step toward practical oxide electronics. More details in section 5.3. \n\nTable 4 lists the p-type TFTs with SnO channel layer. \n\n 5. Emerging Applications \n\n## 5.1. Displays With Oxide-Based Backplanes\n\n![26_image_0.png](26_image_0.png)\n\n Given the close relation between TFTs and displays, it is not strange that the most significant application of oxide TFTs is on displays, mostly LCDs and OLEDs. From 2007, Soc. Information Display (SID) and International Meeting on Information Display (IMID) exhibitions have been the stage for the presentation of several prototypes employing oxide TFT technology. \n\n At CENIMAT | I3N, oxides have been used both for passive matrix (PM) and active matrix (AM) backplanes (the integration of the PM and AM backplanes presented here with frontplane technologies was done at Centro Ricerche Fiat Italy and Hewlett Packard Ireland, respectively, under the framework of Multifl exioxides FP6 project). The PM backplane was produced using room temperature sputtered IZO, [481,484] patterned using conventional photolithographic processes, on 5 ×\n3 cm glass and polymeric substrates. Transparent alphanumeric displays with 7 segments, usable as head-up displays (HUDs) in automotive industry, were obtained by integration with chipLED frontplane technology \n( **Figure** 50 ).\n\n AM backplanes for 2.8\" LCDs were fabricated on glass, consisting of an array of 128 × 128 pixels, with each pixel having an \n© 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

[ 303 ] For demonstration purposes, the architecture was the simplest possible, with a single TFT per pixel. Backplane production consisted on a standard 5 mask process, using either Ti/Au or IZO source-drain and gate electrodes (for opaque and transparent AMs, respectively), GIZO channel layer, TSiO dielectric and SU-8 passivation. Finally, the final backplanes were annealed at 150 °C. The AM backplanes were then successfully integrated with reflective LCD frontplanes (Figure 51c). Still, evidences of some shorted gates were observed and attributed to the lack of reliability and reproducibility of the TSiO dielectric.\n\nSeveral companies are currently working on oxide TFTs for demonstrating flexible and/or transparent displays. Some examples, all driven by GIZO TFIs, are the works from Samsung SDI, with a 4.1\" 176 × 220 resolution full-colour OLED\ndisplay, having a transmittance higher than 20%; [279,485] from LG Electronics Inc., with a 3.5\" 176 × 220 resolution OLED display on a 0.1 mm thick stainless steel plate; [486] from Toppan Printing Inc., with 4\" 320 × 240 resolution electrophoretic display on polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) plastic substrate\n(Figure 52a). [487] With atomic layer deposited ZnO TFTs, Park et al.\n\nalso reported a 2.5\" 220 × 176 resolution OLED transparent display on a glass substrate. 1488 But even when transparency of the overall display is not persuaded, oxide TFTs are of great interest. Their high mobility and large area uniformity can yield high-end displays, such as the 70\" ultra-definition (UD) LCD 3DTV with a high scanning frequency (240 Hz) demonstrated by Samsung in 2010.\n\nIn most of the reported displays employing oxide TFTs, the channel layer is produced by sputtering. But despite the early stage of research on solution-processed oxide TFTs, LCD and OLED\ndisplays were already fabricated using this lower cost processing technology. In 2008, Chiang et al. reported sol-gel Zn 0.97Z10.03 O Ts driving a 4.1\" LCD display.[489] The first demonstration with OLEDs is attributed to Samsung Electronics, with a 2.2\" monochromatic display with 128 × 160 resolution (Figure 52b), being the spin-coated IZO TFTs processed at a maximum temperature of 350 °C. 4901 Other works followed, with increased panel sizes and resolution, such as the 4.1\" LCD display with 320 × 240 resolution driven by spin- coated GIZO TFTs reported by Taiwan TFT LCD Association (TTLA)/Inpria Corp./Oregon State University.\n\nThe stage is now set for a variety of displays using oxide TFT\ntechnology, with small area flexible OLEDs and large area rigid high-end LCD and OLED displays being probably the main targets for commercial products in the near future. The numerous prototypes already shown by most of the greatest display companies is certainly an indication that products within the \"transparent electronics\" concept or, employing oxide semiconductors but not necessarily resulting in transparent displays, should not be far from entering in our daily life. In fact, as pointed out in the introduction, mass-production of the first transparent 2\" LCD panels was already announced by Samsung in 2011. These displays exhibit a 1680 × 1050 resolution, a contrast ratio of 500:1 and a transparency of 15%. Instead of a backlight, ambient light is used, resulting in a 90% decrease in power consumption when compared with conventional LCDs.\n\n## 5.2. Inverters And Ring Oscillators\n\nFor any semiconductor technology, the fabrication of inverters and ring oscillators (ROs) is a basic requirement for producing\n\n![28_image_0.png](28_image_0.png)\n\n![28_image_1.png](28_image_1.png)\n\nLCD display: a) photograph of a transparent AM on glass; b) microscopy image of pixel area (350 × 350 µ m); c) prototype after integration with LCD front plane. [ 303 ]\na complete range of logic circuits. A simple inverter is composed by two transistors (control and load). When the input voltage ( V IN ) is low the control transistor is in the off-state and the load transistor pulls the output ( VOUT ) to a \"high\" level.\n\nWhen V IN is high, current flows through the control transistor, causing the output to be at a \"low\" level. A RO consists of any odd number of inverters connected in series. The evaluation of the performance of these simple circuits can provide a valuable tool to define the range of applications of a TFT technology. For instance, the propagation delay of a RO is a widely accepted benchmark regarding how fast a TFT can operate. [225]\nTo the authors' knowledge, the first transparent circuits with oxide semiconductors were reported in 2006 by Presley et al [491]\nThe authors reported sputtered IGO TFT based inverters and five-stage ROs on glass. Figure 53a shows the voltage transfer characteristic (VTC) of the inverters, which present a peak gain magnitude (dV out /dV in ) of ≈1.5. A maximum oscillation frequency of 9.5 kHz and a propagation delay of 11 µ s/stage are achieved for the RO. These values are significantly affected by the large parasitic capacitance arising due to the large source/ gate and drain/gate overlap, used here to facilitate device fabrication.\n\nFiner design rules and improved TFT performance allowed Ofuji et al. [225] to report in 2007 five-stage ROs based on GIZO\nTFTs with considerably improved performance, such as an oscillation frequency of 410 kHz and a propagation delay of REVIEW\n\n![29_image_0.png](29_image_0.png)\n\n0.24 µ s/stage (Figure 53b). The authors report that the propagation delay achieved in this work is half and almost one third of the ones achieved using a-Si:H and organic TFTs, respectively.\n\nIn 2008 the fastest oxide circuits on glass were reported by Sun et al. [492] ALD deposited ZnO TFTs processed at 200 °C were used to fabricate a seven-stage RO that operates at 2.3 MHz, corresponding to a propagation delay of only 31 ns/stage.\n\nIn 2011, eleven-stage ROs were also fabricated on flexible substrates by Mativenga et al., [220] requiring maximum processing temperatures of 220 °C. These operate at a frequency of 94.8 kHz with a propagation delay of 0.48 µ s/stage. The authors also reported a flexible two-clock shift register (gate driver) with AC operation. Based on gate bias stress measurements, an estimated lifetime of more than 10 years is announced for the gate driver, which is highly promising for flexible display applications (Figure 54).\n\nBesides TFTs, ZnO metal-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MESFETs) were used to fabricate integrated inverters, using Ag x O Schottky diodes as level shifters, as reported by Frenzel et al. [493] in 2010. For this work, ZnO was grown by transparent integrated circuits, and GIZO was already used to fabricate MESFETs with excellent electrical properties ( S =\n69 mV dec − 1 and µ FE = 15 cm 2 V − 1 s − 1 ) with a maximum temperature of 150 °C,[494] but GIZO MESFET inverters were not yet demonstrated.\n\nBased on these initial results, a similar scenario to the one depicted for displays seems to arise regarding oxide-based circuits: transparency can be an added- value property for specific applications, but the main focus of research is on exploring the great electrical properties and low processing temperatures of oxide TFTs that allow low cost and high performance circuit fabrication, even on flexible substrates.\n\n## 5.3. Oxide Cmos\n\nAll the circuit applications reported in 5.2 make use of only n-type oxide TFTs, i.e., are based on NMOS logic. However, both n- and p-type oxide TFTs are required if the fabrication of complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) circuits is envisaged. CMOS technology offers great advantages over NMOS, especially regarding power dissipation and higher density of logic functions on a chip.\n\nInitial results on transparent CMOS inverters were already obtained at CENIMATJI3N (this work was done in collaboration with Dr. Sang-Hee Ko Park and Dr. Chi-Sun\n\n![30_image_0.png](30_image_0.png)\n\nHwang from ETRI, Korea), by using the sputtered GIZO TFTs and SnO TFIs presented in section 4, with multilayer hafnium-based dielectric and IZO electrodes. At this initial stage, a passivation layer was not used. After production, the CMOS\ninverters were annealed at 200 °C for 30 min in air. Figure 55 shows a 2.5 × 2.5 cm glass substrate with several transparent CMOS inverters.\n\nThe VTC for a transparent CMOS inverter is presented in Figure 56. The peak gain is ≈ 1.7, being a gain magnitude above 1 is required to sustain signal propagation in integrated circuits using inverters, such as ROs. However, even for low V IN the p-type TFT has some non-negligible current flowing between source and drain, causing V OUT < V DD . The fact that the p-type TFT cannot be entirely switched off also contributes to the fact that for larger V IN we have V OUT > 0 V. A more detailed knowledge regarding how to control the subgap density of states in p-type oxide semiconductors will certainly allow to improve device and circuit performance, but even at this initial stage these results already prove that transparent CMOS circuit design is achievable using transparent oxide semiconductors with maximum (post-)processing temperatures of 200 °C.\n\nReports on oxide semiconductor based CMOS are fairly recent. Given that p-type oxide TFTs are still at the initial stage of research, the initial CMOS inverters were based on hybrid solutions, comprising n-type oxide TFTs and p-type organic TFTs. Dhanajay et al. [495]\nreported in 2008 a hybrid CMOS inverter on Si substrates based on ambipolar TFTs comprising a stack of In 2 O 3 and pentacene as the channel layer. The ambipolar behaviour critically depends on the thickness and morphology of the In2O3 layer. Two identical ambipolar TFTs, fabricated with a maximum temperature of 750 °C, were used to build a CMOS inverter that exhibits a peak gain of 9.\n\nStill in 2008, the same authors [474] reported for the first time fully oxide based CMOS inverters, by combining p-type SnOx and n-type In 2 O 3 TFTs, being the channel layers being produced by reactive evaporation. The inverter operates at fairly high voltages and exhibits a peak gain of ≈ 11 (Figure 57).\n\nIn 2010, Yabuta et al. [477] reported the formation of both n-type SnO 2 TFTs and p-type SnO TFTs in the same substrate, by using a SiO x capping layer on top of sputtered SnO films, which allows to fine-tune the oxygen content of the SnO film during an annealing process (300 °C), something crucial to obtain p-type behaviour in SnO. A conceptual design of a CMOS inverter based on this production method was presented\n(Figure 58a), but no actual CMOS devices were fabricated.\n\nFollowing the previous paper, 1477 the ambipolar effect observed in SnO films was successfully applied to a CMOS inverter by Nomura et al. [483] in 2011. But in this case, rather than using organic and oxide semiconductors, [495] only SnO was used to achieve the ambipolar behaviour, this being the first demonstration of a CMOS circuit using a single oxide semiconductor. The SnO films were deposited by PLD at room temperature on thermally oxidized Si substrates, being the final devices annealed at 250 °C. The CMOS inverter operates with a peak gin of ≈ 2.5 (Figure 58b). The low gain when compared with other ambipolar transistors containing channel layer of different materials such as microcrystalline silicon and organics (voltage gains 5–20) is justified by the large off current and imbalance of the SnO TFTs, caused by the low µ FE of the n-type SnO TFTs.\n\n![30_image_1.png](30_image_1.png)\n\nREVIEW\n\n![31_image_0.png](31_image_0.png)\n\n Recently, Martins et al. [496] succeed to perform a paper-CMOS \ndc inverter with n- and p-type oxide TFTs using GIZO and non-stoichiometric SnO x (x < 2) respectively, with an IZO gate electrode. All the layers that constitute the CMOS device were processed by reactive magnetron sputtering at room temperature. The process sequence is depicted in **Figure** 59 . Both TFTs exhibit electron and hole mobilities greater than 21 cm 2 V − 1 s − 1 and 1 cm 2 V − 1 s − 1 , respectively. As the paper itself can act as both substrate and dielectric, this means that the complexity of transferring a stand-alone electronic circuit onto a paper page is reduced. The challenge of paper electronics is to be able to produce low power consumption devices to allow densely packed integrated circuits, for a plethora of applications such \n\n![31_image_1.png](31_image_1.png)\n\nas computer memory chips, digital logic circuits, microprocessors, and analogue (linear) \ncircuits, among others, thus fueling the intended microelectronics revolution in the so-called technologies of information and communication. [497,498]\n The paper-CMOS gain was 4.2 which is an encouraging value for the future prospects of paper electronics ( **Figure** 60 ). Indeed, as illustrated by the inverter example described, CMOS on and with paper looks good; leading to the architecture of circuits naturally do not draw power and can easily be implemented as static circuits without the need for clocking circuitry, contributing today for the shaping of electronics of tomorrow.\n\n Although in this fi rst attempt of fabricating a CMOS device with and on paper a high leakage current is observed, it is not surprising given the advance from a rigid substrate to paper. Additionally the conventional FET gate dielectric is now replaced by paper. \n\nThe use of paper dielectrics and layering of p- and n-channel FETs is highly promising. The performance of the circuit presented here does not inhibit the implementation of CMOS on paper, thus creating an opportunity for light weight, low cost and fully recyclable complementary circuits–green electronics. This is expected to create applications in disposable and recyclable electronics that range from smart labels, tags, sensors and memories to TFT driven electro-chromic paper displays, batteries [499,500] and integrated systems. \n\n 6. Conclusions There has been tremendous progress in oxide based TFTs performance during the last 7 years. At present, we have reached the point where several companies such as Samsung Electronics, Samsung Mobile Display, Toppan, AU Optronics, Sharp, and LG Display have already demonstrated many prototypes of AMLCD and AMOLED panels that integrate oxide TFT backplanes and some of them have announced the mass production of fl at panel displays using this new technology. \n\n Concerning n-type oxide semiconductors, GIZO deposited by sputtering remains the best performer because of is amorphous structure and excellent electrical properties. Notwithstanding the strong advantages of oxide based TFTs, research on stability is still an open question. Besides the best dielectric material as well as dielectric/semiconductor combination, the type of TFT structure/ architecture including passivation issues will play an important role in stability questions. More fundamental research includes a better understanding of the density of states and defect levels in ionic bonding Adv. *Mater.* 2012, 24**, 2945–2986**\n\n![32_image_0.png](32_image_0.png)\n\nbased semiconductors, which will lead to a more detailed understanding on the mechanisms that govern device stability. \n\n Since 2009 substantial improvements have taken place in solution-processed oxide semiconductors, and the obtained mobilities are competing with the ones obtained trough physical techniques. The actual limitation of solution-based processes are the need to use higher temperatures, nevertheless huge achievements have been made and TFT mobilities around 10 cm 2 V − 1 s − 1 have been obtained at temperatures as low as 200 ° C. Solution-based processes and novel applications will also be seriously considered in future research. This can be achieved by developing novel low-temperature chemistries and/or processes. The accomplishment of a low temperature process and reasonable device stability/reliability will be critical to the success of this new but very promising technology. \n\n Although the performance achieved with oxide transistors processed at low temperature exceed far beyond the ones obtained with amorphous silicon and organic semiconductors, the oxides reported in the literature are mostly limited to n-type device applications, since there is a lack of p-type oxide semiconductors. Concerning the work developed so far on this topic, currently two promising candidates for p-type oxide TFTs seem to exist: copper oxide and tin oxide based semiconductors. \n\nThe best results obtained are for Cu 2 O and SnO with mobilities and on/off ratios of the order of 4.3 cm 2 V − 1 s − 1 , 3 × 10 6 and 4.6 cm 2 V − 1 s − 1 , 7 × 10 4 , respectively. \n\n Taking into account the excellent properties presented by oxide semiconductors, they are not restricted to TFTs to be used in AMLCDs or AMOLEDs display applications. Inverters, ring oscillators and CMOS inverters, either on glass, fl exible and paper substrates have already been presented. \n\n From what was already proved, oxide semiconductor based devices is today a new technology that not only may replace the conventional silicon technology in some applications but also opens new areas of applications, probably faster than you can imagine or realize! \n\n The successful development of these new materials will require increased multidisciplinary partnerships among physicists, chemists, biochemists, and engineers. \n\nAdv. *Mater.* 2012, 24**, 2945–2986**\n Acknowledgements First of all we would like to thank to European Research Council trough the Advanced Grant (given to EF) under the project \"INVISIBLE\" (ERC2008-AdG 228144) Advanced Amorphous Multicomponent Oxides for Transparent Electronics, directly related to this topic, as well as to the support given from European Commission and the partners involved under the following projects: Multifl exioxides (NMP3-CT-2006-032231), the fi rst 100% running project on Transparent Electronics in Europe, and more recently to ORAMA (NMP3-LA-2010-246334) and POINTS \n(NMP3-SL-2011-263042), that are related to multifunctional oxide based electronic materials and printable organic-inorganic transparent semiconductor devices, respectively. \n\n We would like also to thank the fruitful collaborations done directly with companies and institutes like SAIT-SAMSUNG project \"STABOXI\", related to the passivation of a-GIZO TFTs, Electronic and Telecommunications Research Institute of South Korea (ETRI) with the project IT R&D program of MKE - 2006-S079-03, \"Smart window with transparent electronic devices\" and to Saint Gobain Recherche France, for the project related to oxides for glazing. \n\n This work was partially funded by the Portuguese Science Foundation \n(FCT-MCTES) through Multiannual contract with I3N and with projects related to oxide semiconductors like: POCI/CTM/55945/2004 (Development of transparent and conductive oxide semiconductors p-type: from synthesis to devices); POCI/CTM/55942/2004 (Transparent thin fi lm transistors based on zinc oxide to be used in fl exible displays); PTDC/CTM/73943/2006 (Multifunctional Oxides: a Novel Approach for Low temperature Integration of oxide Semiconductors as Active and passive thin fi lms in the future generation of electronic systems); PTDC/ EEA-ELC/64975/2006 (High mobility transparent amorphous oxide semiconductors thin fi lm transistors for active matrix displays); PTDC/ CTM/103465/2008 (Integrated Memory Paper using oxide based Channel thin fi lm Transistors); PTDC/EEA-ELC/099490/2008 (From Electronic Paper to Paper Electronic–Paper_@); PTDC/CTM/099124/2008 (Electrochromic thin fi lm transistors for smart windows applications); QREN No. 3454 (New nanoxide composites for advanced fabrication of targets for passive and active Opto/Micro/Nano-electronics applications); CMU-PT/SIA/0005/2009 (Self-organizing power management for photo-voltaic power plants) and ERA-NET/0005/2009 (Multifunctional zinc oxide-based nanostructures: from materials to a new generation of devices). \n\n We fi nish by acknowledging those who made this review possible, specially the group of Microelectronic and Optoelectronic Materials of CENIMAT | **I3N and CEMOP, without them this work would be** \nimpossible.

AOSs represented by amorphous In–Ga–Zn–O (a-IGZO) are expected to be the channel material of TFTs in next-generation flat-panel displays because a-IGZO TFTs satisfy almost all the requirements for organic light-emitting-diode displays, large and fast liquid crystal and three-dimensional (3D) displays, which cannot be satisfied using conventional silicon and organic TFTs. The major insights of this review are summarized as follows. (i) Most device issues, such as uniformity, long-term stability against bias stress and TFT performance, are solved for a-IGZO TFTs.\n\n(ii) A sixth-generation (6G) process is demonstrated for 3200 and 3700 displays. (iii) An 8G\nsputtering apparatus and a sputtering target have been developed. (iv) The important effect of deep subgap states on illumination instability is revealed. (v) Illumination instability under negative bias has been intensively studied, and some mechanisms are proposed.\n\n(vi) Degradation mechanisms are classified into back-channel effects, the creation of traps at an interface and in the gate insulator, and the creation of donor states in annealed a-IGZO\nTFTs by the Joule heating; the creation of bulk defects should also be considered in the case of unannealed a-IGZO TFTs. (vii) Dense passivation layers improve the stability and photoresponse and are necessary for practical applications. (viii) Sufficient knowledge of electronic structures and electron transport in a-IGZO has been accumulated to construct device simulation models. Keywords: amorphous oxide semiconductor, thin-film transistor, liquid crystal display, organic light-emitting diode display, mobility, stability, mass production\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nSince our report in November 2004 on transparent and flexible thin-film transistors (TFTs) using amorphous In–Ga–Zn–O (a-IGZO), a representative amorphous oxide semiconductor\n(AOS) (figure 1) [1], several display companies have joined the development of this type of TFTs and have demonstrated various flat-panel displays (FPDs) including electronic papers (e-papers), organic light-emitting-diode displays (OLEDs)\nand liquid crystal displays (LCDs). The largest panel sizes of prototype displays reached 1900 for OLEDs [2] and 3700 for LCDs [3] as of early 2010.\n\nIn this paper, we review the present status of AOS\nincluding their applications to FPDs and integrated circuits as well as their fundamental material science. Since we have attempted to minimize the overlap of content with preceding review papers, further details can be found in the following references. Reference [4] is for general readers and [5]\n1468-6996/10/044305+23$30.00 1 © 2010 National Institute for Materials Science Printed in the UK\n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)\n\ncontains more scientific and technical data as well as reference papers. More review papers are contained in a special issue of J. Disp. Technol. on transparent electronics [6].\n\nThe first part of this review was written with general readers in mind and will concentrate on the background and present status of oxide electronics, focusing on TFT technology. The second part overviews recent reports on scientific and technical issues related to AOS materials and their TFT characteristics, particularly focusing on a-IGZO.\n\n## 2. Discovery Of Aoss\n\nFPDs and light-emitting diodes (LEDs), used in common electronic devices such as computers, were traditionally fabricated using conventional semiconductors such as Si, GaAs, InP and GaN. This situation changed in the late 1990 s because of intensive research on oxide conductors such as ZnO [7] for their application as active layers in semiconductor devices. A series of advances have been reported for ZnO, particularly in terms of film growth technology [8], its application in devices such as LEDs [9, 10]\nand the elucidation of its intrinsic properties [11], which led to demonstrations of mesoscopic effects in ZnO heterojunction systems [12] and proved that oxides can compete with conventional semiconductors (see [13] for a review).\n\nThe applications of polycrystalline ZnO (poly-ZnO) to TFTs have also been studied because poly-ZnO is known to act as an active layer in a semiconductor device even when fabricated at low temperatures below 300 ◦C. Therefore, ZnO is expected to replace hydrogenated amorphous silicon\n(a-Si:H), which is used in current FPDs. The first report on a ZnO TFT, which was fabricated in a single crystal, was published in 1968 [14], following the first proposal of a TFT fabricated using CdS in 1962 [15] and reports on TFTs fabricated using other oxides (SnO2, In2O3) [16, 17]. After a long incubation period, ZnO TFT research was revisited with many papers appearing since 2003. It is recognized that poly-ZnO TFTs still have many issues to be addressed, such as their low mobility of charge carriers and unstable electrical properties, which are largely due to grain boundaries. Another problem is the difficulty of microfabrication, which originates from their low chemical durability against acidic etchants and reducing atmospheres. There have recently been a significant improvements in these areas, and FPDs using ZnO TFT\narray backplanes have been demonstrated in active-matrix (AM)-LCDs by Kochi University of Technology [18, 19]\nand in transparent AM-OLEDs by the Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI) and LG\nElectronics (LGE) group [20, 21].\n\nWe have investigated AOSs since the mid-1990 s but from the viewpoint of fundamental materials research rather than semiconductor devices. The main objective of our research has always been to develop new functional oxide/inorganic materials, and the discovery of electrically conducting materials among amorphous oxides was a challenging topic.\n\nUntil then, only a few amorphous oxide conductors had been suggested such as InOx [22] and Sn-doped In2O3 (indium tin oxide, ITO) [23], but their structures and properties were poorly characterized. We developed a materials design concept for amorphous oxide conductors and published it in 1996 [24]. We expected that the delocalized s orbitals of heavy\n\n| Sci. Technol. Adv.

This hypothesis was proven to be correct, and many amorphous oxide conductors have since been found such as AgSbO3\n[25], 2CdO·GeO2 [26],\n2CdO·PbO [27], CdS·In2Sx [28] and InGaO3(ZnO)m (m 6 4)\n[29]. These materials were targeted for use as transparent conductive oxides and designed to have high electron density, electrical conductivity and optical transmittance.\n\nThis situation changed owing to the increasing interest in flexible electronic devices. The development of the flexible electronics was mainly driven by organic semiconductors until early 2000s, and ZnO research followed this trend. We considered the advantages and disadvantages of ZnO\nand organic semiconductors to be as follows. The main advantage common to these materials is that they can produce semiconductor devices as active layers even if they are deposited at low temperatures of markedly below 300 ◦C, whereas their main disadvantage is the instability and nonuniformity of properties due to grain boundaries. Another issue relevant to all these materials is the alteration of their electrical properties upon adsorption and desorption of trace amounts of oxygen and water. Another serious problem of ZnO and other oxide semiconductors, particularly for TFT use, is their high concentration of residual free electrons\n(>1017 cm−3) due to native defects such as zinc interstitials and oxygen vacancies. Consequently, it has been difficult to control the threshold voltage and to fabricate normally-off TFTs using poly-ZnO channels. To solve this problem, we employed a high-quality single-crystalline channel layer of InGaZnO4 (sc-IGZO) and demonstrated that the sc-IGZO\nlayer does not generate a high density of residual carriers, resulting in normally-off TFTs [30]. Similarly to sc-IGZO, we found that it was difficult to dope a high density of electrons into some amorphous oxides; for instance, we had to use proton implantation to dope 2CdO · GeO2 [26]. This in turn means that the free-electron density can be stably controlled down to markedly below 1015 cm−3 using such materials including amorphous InGaO3(ZnO)m. An important advantage of amorphous materials is that they do not suffer from the grain boundary problems typical for poly-ZnO. Using these advantages, we started research on TFTs with a-IGZO channels in 2003 and reported our first results in late 2004 [1]; we demonstrated the room-temperature fabrication of transparent, flexible TFTs on polyethylene terephthalate\n(PET) substrates by pulsed laser deposition (figure 1). The amorphous oxides used for active layers in semiconductor devices are now known as amorphous oxide semiconductors\n(AOSs).\n\n## 3. Advantages Of Aoss 3\n\nAs explained in the Introduction, AOSs including a-IGZO\nare promising channel materials for TFT backplanes in FPDs because of the following features (see table 1 for a comparison with Si TFTs). AOS TFTs are compatible with the present FPD industry, which uses large inexpensive glass substrates, because they are fabricated at low temperatures below 400 ◦C\nor even at room temperature. This is the main reason why a-Si:H TFTs are used in FPDs—a-Si:H films are deposited at temperatures below 350 ◦C using plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition and SiH4 gas. However, a-Si:H has many problems such as low mobility (<1 cm2 V\n−1s\n−1), instability under illumination (the Staebler-Wronski effect [31–33]) and electrical bias stress.\n\nThe mobility is improved to above 10 cm2 V\n−1s\n−1 by employing an AOS. The problem of instability was also the main concern regarding the mass production of AOSs, but recent studies have proved that the stability of a-IGZO\nTFTs is much greater than that of a-Si:H and organic TFTs and is comparable to that of polycrystalline silicon\n(poly-Si) TFTs. Poly-Si TFTs have well-known advantages over a-Si:H and organic TFTs, such as a high carrier mobility which can exceed 100 cm2 V\n−1s\n−1and excellent stability. It is also possible to fabricate poly-Si devices on inexpensive glass substrates by excimer laser annealing (such materials are called low-temperature poly-Si (LTPS)).\n\nHowever, the main drawback of poly-Si TFTs is their unacceptable variation of electrical properties due to grain boundary problems (short-range nonuniformity) [34, 35]\n\n![4_image_0.png](4_image_0.png)\n\nand inhomogeneous laser crystallization over a large area\n(long-range nonuniformity).\n\nThese drawbacks—the low mobility and instability of a-Si:H TFTs and the poor uniformity of poly-Si TFTs—have not been critical for AM-LCDs because a low mobility of ∼0.5 cm2 V\n−1s\n−1is sufficient for driving the present AM-LCDs of less than 90 inches diagonal size, and the instability and nonuniformity are compensated by LCD driver circuits. However, OLEDs require high mobilities because OLED pixels emit light by electrical current injection (i.e. an OLED is a current-driving device) and TFTs must support high currents. In addition, even a small distribution or fluctuation of TFT parameters, such as threshold voltage (Vth),\nresults in an unacceptable difference in the brightness of OLED pixels, causing a serious *mura* problem. For example, Jeong *et al* [36] reported that a variation in Vth of only ±0.1 V\nchanges the OLED luminance by 16%. Therefore, the OLED\ndisplays using a-Si:H, poly-Si and organic TFTs reported to date must employ complex compensation circuits having four or more TFTs (e.g. 4T2C and 5T2C circuits as listed in table 1; 4T2C means that the circuit involves four transistors and two capacitors). It is believed that such TFTs will not be used in the future mass production of OLED displays.\n\nHowever, the situation is changing rapidly even for AM-LCDs. It has been reported that the low-mobility a-Si:H TFTs cannot drive larger LCDs (e.g. 55 inches) operating at high frame rates above 120 Hz [37, 38]; the required mobility will be even higher for displays with higher resolution, a faster frame rate and a larger panel size (figure 2). Recently, three-dimensional (3D) displays have appeared on the market with panel sizes of ∼55 inches and frame rates of 240 Hz.\n\nHowever, higher frame rates of e.g. 480 Hz are required to improve the picture quality because a 3D display must project two or more picture frames alternately for the left and right eyes.\n\nFor these reasons, new channel materials are desired, and AOSs are expected to be one such material because they comply with all the above requirements. In particular, (i) they have high mobilities compatible with OLEDs, large LCDs and high-frame-rate 3D displays, (ii) they are compatible with large glass substrates (low-temperature fabrication) and present FPD technology, (iii) they have excellent uniformity owing to their amorphous structure and (iv) they are much more stable than a-Si:H and organic TFTs. AOS TFTs have other advantages such as the absence of a short-channel effect in small transistors [39] and the absence of the kink effect observed in crystalline silicon transistors.\n\n## 4. Present Status Of Displays And Circuits Based On Aos Tfts 4.1. Flat-Panel Displays\n\nThe development history of a-IGZO FPDs up to 2008 is summarized in [4] and more recent data are included in figures 3 and 4. As mentioned above, the first AOS TFT was reported in late 2004. Development research began in 2004 and Toppan Printing Co. Ltd first reported an AM display using AOS TFTs in the form of a flexible black-and-white e-paper in 2005 [40]. LGE has collaborated with ETRI on oxide TFTs and focused mainly on ZnO TFTs [20, 21].\n\nAfter that, LGE started working on AOSs, and reported the first AM-OLED display in 2006 [41]. Following them, Samsung SDI and Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology\n(SAIT) reported AM-OLED displays in mid-2007 [42, 43].\n\nThe largest displays by the end of 2008 were a 12.1 00 AM-OLED [44, 45] and a 1500 AM-LCD operating at 240 Hz with integrated gate drivers, as reported at the Society for Information Display (SID) meeting [46].\n\nFrom late 2008, more companies started activities involving AOSs. Hitachi Ltd, reported the low-voltage operation of AOS TFTs [47]. AU Optronics Corp. (AUO)\nstarted AOS TFT research in 2008 [48] and displayed a 2.4 00\n\n 11  \n\n![5_image_0.png](5_image_0.png)\n\n| size of and the original resolution without 'Q'. For example, QVGA has a resolution of 320 × 240 and QQVGA has that of 160 × 120. CIF 352 × 288 XGA 1024 × 768 QCIF+ 176 × 220 SXGA 1280 × 1024 (W)VGA (800)640 × 480 UXGA 1600 × 1200 SVGA 800 × 600 FHD 1920 × 1080 WQVGA 160 × 272 WXGA 1280 × 720/768/800   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n\nQVGA (see table 2 for the abbreviations of the resolutions)\nAM-OLED at FPD International (FPDI) 2009, where a 1900 QFHD AM-OLED was reported by Samsung Mobile Display Co. Ltd (SMD) [49] and a 1700 SXGA AM-LCD\nby Samsung LCD. LG Display (LGD) reported a 6.4 00 VGA\nAM-LCD, which was produced using a four-mask process similar to that used for a-Si:H LCD panels at FPDI2009, demonstrating that the production cost of AOS-based FPDs can be comparable to or even lower than those of present a-Si:H devices. Semiconductor Energy Laboratory (SEL)\ndemonstrated source/gate driver integration in a 400 QVGA\nAM-LCD [50, 51] and an AM-OLED [52]. Source/gate drive-integrated AM-LCDs were also reported by Sharp Corp. in the form of a 12.1 00 WXGA AM-LCD [53]. The largest FPD\ndriven by oxide TFTs was a 3700 FHD AM-LCD presented by AUO at TAOS2010 [3]. At the same conference, LGD\nreported a 1500 FHD AM-OLED [54].\n\n## 4.2. Flexible Displays\n\nFlexible displays have also been reported by several companies. The first reported display was the black-and-white e-paper by Toppan [40]. They have since developed more sophisticated displays such as a black-and-white e-paper with a larger size of 5.3500 for a 150 ppi (pixel per inch) resolution and a 200 black-and-white e-paper with the world's highest resolution of 400 ppi [55]. The first flexible FPD was an AM-OLED (3.5 00, QCIF+) fabricated on stainless steel foil presented by LGE [56]. SMD reported a very flexible 6.5 00 WQVGA AM-OLED fabricated on a polyimide substrate, which is bendable up to a curvature radius of 2 cm [57]. Dai Nippon Printing Co. Ltd also reported a flexible 4.7 00 QVGA\nAM-OLED on stainless steel, which combines a white OLED and a flexible color filter array on a polyethylene naphthalene sheet [58].\n\n## 4.3. Transparent Displays\n\nAnother interesting application is transparent electronic devices. Toppan proposed an attractive idea that utilizes the transparency of AOS TFTs [59]. In conventional color AM\ne-papers and displays, a color filter array is formed on the front plane and a TFT array is formed on the back plane.\n\nTherefore, the fine alignment of these planes through liquid crystal or E-Ink microcapsules is necessary to avoid color misfit. However, the thickness of a liquid crystal is only 4–6µm, while that of the E-Ink microcapsules is much larger (40–50µm), which hinders the horizontal alignment. This problem is critical for flexible displays because bending the display inevitably causes misalignment of the components on the front and back planes. Toppan solved this problem by fabricating a transparent TFT array on a color filter array and integrating them into the front plane. This structure can minimize the optical transmission/reflection loss owing to the transparency of the a-IGZO TFTs.\n\nAn important application of this is expected to be in transparent displays. DENSO demonstrated a transparent\n\n![6_image_0.png](6_image_0.png)\n\nmonocolor passive-matrix inorganic display at FPDI2006. Toppan presented a dual-sided black-and-white display at FPDI2009. Moreover, several companies have developed transparent OLED displays. For example, LGD presented a transparent AM-OLED display having an aperture ratio of ∼30% at FPDI2009 (they claim a ∼65% aperture ratio for passive-matrix OLED), partly because they employed opaque LTPS TFT arrays. Samsung SDI reported a 4.1 00 transparent dual-emission QCIF AM-OLED using a-IGZO\nTFTs [60], but its transparency was only ∼20%. LGE and ETRI have developed 2.5 00 QCIF+ transparent OLED displays using ZnO TFT backplanes with a panel transmittance of 60% [20, 21], and they displayed a 1.5 00 QQVGA transparent AM-OLED driven by AOS TFTs with a transparency of 45% at IMID2009. Transparent displays became a hot topic at SID2010; Samsung LCD displayed a 4600 transparent LCD\ndriven by a-Si:H TFTs with an integrated touch panel and LGD presented a 4700 window TV at the exhibition. At the SID2010 conference, SMD presented a 14.1 00 transparent OLED driven by LTPS TFTs with a transparency of up to 38% [61], and AUO featured a 2.4 00 transparent OLED driven by a-IGZO TFTs with an integrated touch panel [62].\n\n## 4.4. System Integration\n\nOne of the main advantages of AOS TFTs is their high carrier mobility. This advantage is exploited in more sophisticated glass-based devices known as 'system-on-glass (SOG)' or\n'system-on-panel (SOP)' devices. In these devices, electronic circuits such as pixel drivers and other peripheral circuits are integrated with TFT arrays on the same glass substrate. SEC\nfirst demonstrated a gate driver-integrated 1500 AM-LCD [46]. SEL integrated source and drain drivers in a 400 QVGA\nAM-LCD [50] and an AM-OLED [51]. More recently, Sharp reported a source/driver-integrated 12.1 00 AM-LCD [53].\n\nTransparent and flexible nonvolatile memories have also been developed by several groups using a-IGZO as active layers [63–65]. These memories are expected to be integrated in AOS-based SOPs.\n\n6\n\n![6_image_1.png](6_image_1.png)\n\nLarge-area fabrication techniques are required for the mass production of FPDs. Although the first AOS TFT was fabricated by pulsed laser deposition, Canon later demonstrated the fabrication of a-IGZO TFTs by radio-frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering [66]. Nowadays, most displays and AOS TFTs are fabricated by RF/dc sputtering. Some companies have attempted to develop large-size sputtering systems. For example, Oregon State University (OSU) and Applied Materials (AMAT) have been collaborating to develop metal-oxide TFTs since 2008 [67], and AKT announced a sputtering system for a 2200 × 2500 mm2 glass substrate at FPDI2007 (designed mainly for ITO). SEL reported a 3.4 00 QHD 326 ppi AM-OLED display based on a-IGZO TFTs and fabricated by a 3.5th-generation (3.5G) process (0.6 × 0.72 m2; see table 3 for the glass size of different LCD process generations) [68]. AUO uses a 6G sputtering target, which was used to produce the 3700 [3] and 3200 AM-LCDs [48]. More recently, ULVAC\nInc. reported the good uniformity of a-IGZO TFTs over a G4 size (0.73 × 0.92 m2area) using a multicathode ac sputtering system (figure 5(a)) [69], and they also developed an 8G-size a-IGZO sputtering target (figure 5(b)). Target manufactures, such as Nippon Mining & Metals Co. Ltd, provide sputtering\n\n 11  \n\n| Table 4.

The current a-Si:H\nLCDs employ 4–5 masks (table 4). One mask step can be eliminated by using a gray mask (also called a half-tone mask)\nto pattern the source/drain electrodes and the channel in a single masking step. LGD presented a 6.4 00 VGA a-IGZO\nAM-LCD fabricated with a 4-mask process at FPDI2009, and AUO has developed a 5-mask process [71]. SMD presented a 7-mask process (table 4) [2, 72], but it was designed for an AM-OLED with an etch-stopper structure and is essentially similar to a-Si:H processes (table 1).\n\nA future critical issue is the material of bus-line electrodes. A-Si:H TFTs have used tough metals with high melting points such as Ta, Cr and Mo/Ta.\n\nLarge, high-resolution and fast-frame-rate panels require higher-conducting electrodes such as Al and Cu. However, Al has poor adhesion to glass and Cu easily diffuses by electromigration as is well known in silicon ultra-large-scale integrated circuit (ULSI) technology. SEC applied Cu-based bus lines to a 1500 AMLCD [46] and AUO applied Ti/Al/Ti electrodes to 3700 AMLCD [3], in which the Ti layers improve the adhesion of the Al layer. In the case of using Cu electrodes, a group from Tohoku University examined a Cu–Mn alloy for a-IGZO TFTs and found that a self-forming MnOx layer acts as a good passivation and diffusion barrier [73]. Toppan also studied Al and Mo bus lines for e-papers because e-papers larger than 1000 will require a thick ITO layer (above 1µm) [74].\n\n4.6. Solution and printing processes Other future issues are solution processes and printing technologies. These issues are thought to be the largest drawback of AOS TFTs compared with organic TFTs because, in general, oxide materials have high melting points and require high synthesis temperatures. Despite this, solution processes have been intensively studied and improved as summarized in table 5. The pioneer of this field is the HP and OSU group, who fabricated amorphous In–Zn–O (a-IZO) TFTs from halide precursors and obtained high mobilities of 16.1 cm2 V\n−1s\n−1for spin-coated TFTs and 7.4 cm2 V\n−1s\n−1for printed TFTs, however, these TFTs required a rather high annealing temperature of 400 ◦C [75].\n\nSAIT has intensively studied solution processes [76] and reported the first solution-processed oxide TFT panels in the form of a 2.2 00 QQVGA AM-OLED, a 400 color QVGA\nLCD [77] and a single-color 400 QVGA AM-OLED [78].\n\nTaiwan TFT LCD Association (TTLA)/Inpria Corp./OSU\nalso reported a 4.1 00 QVGA AM-LCD [79]. They chose amorphous In–Zn–O (a-IZO) because the solution process becomes rather complex for multicomponent materials such as a-IGZO. Toppan succeeded in fabricating a high-mobility\n(5.4 cm2 V\n−1s\n−1) AOS TFT at a rather low temperature of 270 ◦C from a solution supplied by Evonik Industries and also fabricated a 400 ppi VGA e-paper [74]. Lim *et al* [80]\nreported solution-processed a-IGZO TFTs and found that their a-IGZO films contained fine microstructures including pores. The development and selection of new precursors and the improvement of microstructure are important current\n\n![8_image_0.png](8_image_0.png)\n\n## 4.7. Section Summary\n\nThe above activities indicate that AOS TFTs can be fabricated using very similar processes to those of present a-Si:H\ntechnology, and that the key technology steps, such as large-area sputtering targets and deposition systems, are being rapidly developed for their mass production. AUO announced at FINETECH JAPAN 2010 that they are ready to use a-IGZO\nTFTs for FPDs, and other companies also imply production of AOS-based FPDs.\n\n## 5. Operation Characteristics Of A-Igzo Tfts 5.1. Tft Structures And Fabrication Process\n\nHereafter, we overview the fundamental properties of a-IGZO and the operation characteristics of a-IGZO TFTs. Figure 6 illustrates typical device structures used for AOS TFTs. It is convenient to specify the TFT structure by the stacking order of the gate electrode, channel layer and source/drain electrodes (contacts) and to classify them into combinations of top/bottom gate and top/bottom contact. There is another structure called a co-planar structure in which source/drain contacts are formed in the same plane of the channel layer. This structure is employed for poly-Si TFTs and c-Si field-effect transistors (FETs), and its use has also recently been proposed for a-IGZO TFTs, as mentioned in section 5.5. The top-gate structure was employed for TFTs using epitaxial layers in which it is difficult to form a bottom electrode (e.g. c-InGaZnO4 FET [30]). This structure has other advantages. For example, it requires only two patterning mask steps at minimum, and the upper gate insulator and electrode act as passivation layers that protect the channel layer from degradation due to atmospheric exposure. Bottom-gate structures are common in laboratory research because commercially available SiO2/Si wafers can be used for the gate insulator and electrode, respectively, and TFT structures are easily formed by the deposition of a channel layer with a single mask step to form the source and drain electrodes (note that another mask step to make mesas of channel regions would be better employed to suppress the gate leakage current and prevent stray current, which often leads to the overestimation of TFT mobilities). This structure is, of course, not applicable to practical displays, and it has various disadvantages. For example, (i) the back-channel surface is exposed to the atmosphere, and therefore the TFT\ncharacteristics can be affected by the adsorption, desorption and diffusion of atmospheric gases, causing instability\n(section 5.8) and (ii) the gate—source/drain overlaps are very large and result in a large parasitic capacitance, which slows the response of devices and circuits. Both gate structures can employ either top-contact or bottom-contact structures. An advantage of the top-contact structure for oxide TFTs is that it can minimize the oxidation of the source/drain electrodes at the semiconductor channel interface, and geometrically accurate contacts can easily be formed. On the other hand, using a bottom-contact structure, more care is required to make good contacts with the upper channel layer, such as by forming taper-edge structures in the electrodes [66].\n\nInverted staggered structures have been employed in most prototype displays. One reason for this is that the same structures are used for a-Si:H TFTs. These structures employ bottom-gate and top-contact configurations, which are further classified by the structure above the channel layer. One is an etch-stopper structure, where an etching protection layer is formed before forming the source and drain; the latter are patterned by etching (as proposed for a-IGZO TFTs in [81]). The other is a channel-etch structure where a part of the channel layer is removed when the source and drain are formed by etching. The channel-etching procedure damages the back-channel surface and can cause the degradation of TFT characteristics; it also requires a thick channel to stop etching in the channel layer. The etch-stopper structure is free from these problems but requires an extra patterning mask. Both structures have been employed for the mass production of a-Si:H TFTs and are also used for AOS TFTs.\n\n 11  \n\n![9_image_0.png](9_image_0.png)\n\n## 5.2. Tft Characteristics: Mobility\n\nTFT characteristics are usually deduced from the output characteristics, where the source-to-drain current (IDS) is plotted against the source-to-drain voltage (VDS) for various gate-to-source voltages (VGS), and from the transfer characteristics, where IDS is plotted against VGS for various VDS, as shown in figure 7.\n\nDevice performance is evaluated in terms of several parameters as follows. On-current Ion is particularly important for current-driving devices such as OLEDs. However, Ion depends on the device geometry (i.e. channel width W, length L and thickness tc), the gate insulator material (i.e. dielectric constant εi and gate capacitance CG) and the applied voltages.\n\nTherefore, it is normalized into the field-effect (FE) mobility using an analytical equation based on the following gradual channel approximation (see [82–84] for the fundamental physics and analysis of TFTs and FETs):\n\n$$I_{\\rm DS}=\\frac{W}{L}\\mu C_{\\rm G}\\left[\\left(V_{\\rm GS}-V_{\\rm th}\\right)V_{\\rm DS}-\\frac{V_{\\rm DS}^{2}}{2}\\right].\\tag{1}$$\n\nHere, µ denotes the carrier mobility in the channel and Vth is a pseudo-constant called the threshold voltage. However, the observed IDS is usually lower than expected from equation (1)\nbecause defects in the channel, gate insulator and channel/gate insulator interface trap charge carriers. Therefore, the value of µ obtained from equation (1) and the experimental TFT\ncharacteristics is approximated as\n\n$$\\mu=\\frac{N_{\\mathrm{GS}}-N_{\\mathrm{t,tot}}}{N_{\\mathrm{GS}}}\\mu_{\\mathrm{d}}.$$\n$$\\left(2\\right)$$\n\nHere, µd denotes the drift mobility in the channel, NGS is the total carrier density induced by VGS estimated as NGS =\nCG(VGS–Vth) and Nt,tot denotes the density of carriers trapped by defects. The thus-obtained µ value is called the field-effect mobility µFE (more specifically, the TFT mobility) and is used to assess the TFT performance.\n\nDifferent values of µFE are obtained using different approximations as shown in figures 8(a)–(c), and it is important to check their consistency. Saturation mobility\n(µsat) is obtained from IDS in the saturation regime (i.e. when VDS is markedly above the pinch-off voltage Vp = VGS–Vth)\nunder the condition VDS  Vp using the following equation:\n\n$$I_{\\mathrm{DS}}^{1/2}=\\sqrt{\\frac{W}{2L}\\mu C_{\\mathrm{G}}\\left(V_{\\mathrm{GS}}-V_{\\mathrm{th}}\\right)}\\,.$$\n$$(3)$$\n\nThe values of µsat and Vth are deduced by plotting I\n1/2 DS\nversus VGS as shown in figure 8(a). Note that VDS must be larger than Vp and that there is a large deviation from linearity for low-VDS data. Even taking a large VDS of 10 V,\na slight nonlinearity remains and the deduced parameters vary with µsat = 8.2–12.6 cm2 V\n−1s\n−1and Vth = 0.48–0.93 V, as indicated by the red and blue lines in figure 8.\n\nAs explained above, field-effect mobility is a general term including µsat, while it is also used as a specific definition. In this case, µFE is obtained from transfer characteristics in the linear IDS–VGS region (i.e. at VDS ∼ 0  VGS) using the following equation:\n\n$$I_{\\mathrm{DS}}=\\frac{W}{L}\\mu C_{\\mathrm{G}}V_{\\mathrm{DS}}\\left(V_{\\mathrm{GS}}-V_{\\mathrm{th}}\\right).$$\n$$\\quad(4)$$\n\nThe values of µFE and Vth are obtained by plotting IDS versus VGS as shown in figure 8(b) (13.7 cm2 V\n−1s\n−1and 2.63 V,\nrespectively, using the red line). Note that VDS must be as small as possible (e.g.  0.1 V). Usually IDS–VGS curves are nonlinear; therefore, the value of µFE changes with VGS as shown in figure 8(c), and is represented by the maximum value\n(Note that only the data for VDS = 2 V (the thick line) can be used for evaluating µFE because VDS must be small).\n\n$$\\mu_{\\mathrm{FE}}(V_{\\mathrm{GS}})=g_{\\mathrm{m}}(V_{\\mathrm{GS}})\\frac{L}{W C_{\\mathrm{OX}}V_{\\mathrm{DS}}},$$\n$$({\\boldsymbol{5}})$$\n, (5)\nwhereas crystalline Si and a-Si:H TFTs exhibit a maximum in their µFE–VGS curves [85], µFE monotonically increases up to 18 cm2 V\n−1s\n−1for a-IGZO. This result can be interpreted as reduction of the apparent carrier mobility due to interface scattering in the high-field region in silicon, but not in an a-IGZO TFT fabricated on an atomically flat SiO2/c-Si substrate because the interface scattering is not significant.\n\nHowever, maxima in µFE–VGS curves are observed in other a-IGZO TFTs, for example, in an etch-stopper-type inverted staggered TFT on glass that exhibits a large µFE\n\n![10_image_0.png](10_image_0.png)\n\nof 35.8 cm2 V\n−1s\n−1[81]. The low values of µFE in the low-VGS region are caused by carrier trapping, as follows from equation (2).\n\nThe above analysis of a-IGZO TFT (figures 7 and 8)\nreveals that the two values of mobility, µsat and µFE, are consistent with each other and that the above equations are reliable for evaluating a-IGZO TFTs.\n\nFor practical applications, the off-current (Ioff) is also an important parameter because it determines the minimum power consumption of a device. Usually Ioff < 10−12 A is required for FPDs, and the a-IGZO TFT shown in figure 7(b)\nhas a much smaller value of ∼10−14 A. From the values of Ion and Ioff, the on-to-off current ratio Ron/off = Ion/Ioff is defined, which exceeds 109for an a-IGZO TFT. The origin of Ioff is discussed in section 5.7. 5.3. TFT characteristics: subthreshold voltage swing parameter S Another important TFT parameter is the subthreshold voltage swing (S value), which reflects the value of VGS required to obtain a 10 times larger IDS in the subthreshold region (i.e.\n\nVGS < Vth). It is defined as S = dVGS/d log10 IDS. The S value is also dependent on VGS as shown in figure 8(d), and usually the smallest value of S is taken.\n\nThe importance of the S value is that it determines the minimum VGS required to turn a TFT from the off state to the on state, roughly estimated as 1VGS,min = S × Ron/off.\n\na-IGZO TFTs have an S value of ∼100 meV decade−1, which is comparable to that of poly-Si TFTs; this is a reason why a-IGZO TFTs operate at rather small voltages (<5 V, see figure 7).\n\nThe S value also provides important information about the quality of a TFT. It is related to the trap density in the band gap (subgap traps) at the Fermi level (Dsg) as\n\n$$S=\\ln10\\cdot\\frac{k_{\\rm B}T}{e}\\left(1+\\frac{eD_{\\rm sg}}{C_{\\rm G}}\\right)$$ $$=59.5\\left(1+\\frac{eD_{\\rm sg}}{C_{\\rm G}}0\\right)[{\\rm meV\\;decade}^{-1}\\;{\\rm at\\;300\\;K}].\\tag{6}$$\n\nFrom this equation, the S value of a metal-insulatorsemiconductor (MIS)-type FET should be larger than 59.5 mV decade−1at 300 K and a steeper transfer curve should correspond to a higher-quality channel with fewer defects. The value of Dsg for the a-IGZO TFT described in figure 8(d) is ∼1011 cm−2eV−1. This Dsg value includes contributions from the bulk channel region Nsg and the interface Dit, and it is important to separate them to clarify the origin of the defects. A recent study reported that Dit =\n0.82 × 1011 cm−2eV−1and Nsg = 3.2 × 1016 cm−3eV−1for a TFT annealed in wet oxygen at 400 ◦C [86]. This is discussed in section 5.8 in relation to TFT stability.\n\n 11  \n\n![11_image_0.png](11_image_0.png)\n\n## 5.4. Comparison With A-Si:H Tft\n\nFigure 9 shows the characteristics of an a-Si:H TFT. There are several differences compared with the a-IGZO TFT graphs in figure 7. In particular, (i) Ion is 1000 times smaller at ∼10−6 A,\n(ii) the S value is much larger at ∼0.4 V decade−1, (iii) Ioff is smaller at 10−13 A but increases with decreasing VGS and\n(iv) the IDS–VDS curves are nonlinear even for small VDS. As explained above, Ion and S depend on the device dimensions and should be normalized, for example, into µFE and Dsg. The above analysis yields µsat = 0.24–0.60 cm2 V\n−1s\n−1, Vth =\n0.2–4 V and Dsg ∼ 1012 cm−2eV−1, that is, the FE mobilities are 10 times smaller and the defect density is 10 times larger in a-Si:H TFTs than in a-IGZO TFTs. These values reflect the low mobilities of a-Si:H (∼0.8 cm2 V\n−1s\n−1for electrons and ∼0.002 cm2 V\n−1s\n−1for holes [87]). Because of the low mobilities, the present a-Si:H technology is considered unsuitable for future displays, and owing to the large defect density, a-Si:H TFTs require relatively high operating voltages.\n\n## 5.5. Electrode Structures And Materials\n\nThe nonlinearity of the IDS–VDS curves of the a-Si:H TFT\nin figure 9(a) for small VDS is caused by the large contact resistance, mostly due to the series resistance between the top source/drain electrodes and the bottom channel region (the so-called current crowding effect [88]). Similar effects have also been observed for a-IGZO TFTs, for example, in the first sputtered a-IGZO TFT [66]. The current crowding effect is examined via the channel thickness dependence in reference [89].\n\nThe nonlinearity of the IDS–VDS curves is also affected by the source/drain material and by the contact structure. We analyzed the contact resistance of various channel materials with the transmission line model [90] and found that Ti and ITO are the best electrodes [91]. The contact resistance and interface electric characteristics strongly depend on the electronic structure and carrier density of the channel surface; therefore, several treatments have been employed to improve contacts, such as Ar plasma treatment [92] and the insertion of highly doped a-IZO or a-IGZO. A drawback of oxide semiconductors is that they are easily reduced by chemical and physical treatments, such as Ar or hydrogen plasma treatment or annealing in Ar or hydrogen, but this property can also be used in a sophisticated fabrication process for co-planar homojunction TFTs [93, 94] and self-aligned processes [95–97].\n\nIt should also be noted that multilayer electrode structures such as Ti/Au (i.e. Au on Ti) and Ti/Al/Ti [3] are also used for electrodes. The Au layer protects the bottom reactive metal and decreases the contact resistivity. The Ti layer not only improves the adhesion of the top layer but also reduces the resistivity of the contact with the channel.\n\n## 5.6. Subgap States And Mobility Model\n\nAs explained above, the S value reflects the density of subgap traps, and knowledge of this density (subgap DOS, Dsg(E))\nis important for improving the TFT characteristics. Figure 10 shows a schematic Dsg(E) for a-Si:H and a-IGZO; a-Si:H has tail states below the conduction band minimum (CBM) and above the valence band maximum (VBM), and their energy dependence follows the Urbach law as Dsg(E) ∝ exp (E/Eu)\n(Eu is called the Urbach energy). Different values of Eu are deduced by different methods, but typically Eu ∼ 25 meV for the conduction band tail and Eu ∼ 50 meV for the valence band tail in a-Si:H. For doped a-Si:H, donor and acceptor levels also appear, and their different charge states are labeled as D−/D\n0/D\n+in figure 10(a). A similar subgap DOS has been revealed for a-IGZO as shown in figure 10(b) [5], but there are some differences. As discussed above, S and Dsg are smaller in a-IGZO TFTs than in a-Si:H TFTs.\n\nReflecting this result, the subgap DOS measured by other methods such as device simulation (technology computerassisted design, TCAD) [98] and the capacitance–voltage\n(C–V) method [99] substantiated that the subgap DOS in a-IGZO is one-two orders of magnitude smaller than that in a-Si:H (figure 11(a)). The C–V analysis also shows that the hysteresis in the electrical characteristics of the unannealed a-IGZO TFT (figure 11(b)) is related to an extra subgap DOS at 0.1–0.3 eV below CBM, although this energy level would be too shallow to quantitatively explain the slow response time of the hysteresis (longer than tens of seconds).\n\nThe subgap DOS of a-IGZO varies for different a-IGZO\nTFTs. The larger DOS in a depletion-type TFT than in an enhancement-type TFT is explained by the larger density of donors, and thus of defect states, in the depletion-type TFT. The smaller DOS in an annealed TFT than in an\n\n![12_image_0.png](12_image_0.png)\n\nunannealed TFT indicates that the annealing in air at 400 ◦C\nreduces the defect density and also annihilates the shallow defects in the 0.1–0.3 eV range, removing the hysteresis as shown in figure 11(b). The subgap DOS is separated into the interface (Dit) and the bulk (Nsg) regions (figure 12(a)),\nwhich reveals that annealing decreases Dit from 4.8 × 1011 to 0.82 × 1011 cm−2eV−1cm−2eV−1and Nsg from 7.0 × 1016 to 3.2 × 1016 cm−3eV−1[86].\n\nThe subgap DOS of annealed a-IGZO TFTs is larger when deduced by device simulation than when deduced by the C–V method. This is because in the device simulation it is assumed that the electron mobility is constant and does not depend on carrier density, which is unrealistic as shown in figure 13(a) (the mechanism is discussed on the basis of the percolation conduction model in section 6.2, see figure 13(b)). In contrast, the C–V method does not require the assumption of the mobility model and can provide more reliable DOS data. Therefore, deducing an accurate subgap DOS and mobility model is still challenging [100]. Jeon and co-workers combined a photo-excited C–V method and device simulation and extracted the variation of effective mobility with VGS [101–104]. We also extracted the dependence of mobility on the electron density (Ne) using a combined field-effect method and found that a universal µ(Ne)\nmodel explains the different characteristics of a-IGZO TFTs subjected to different annealing treatments. The universal model follows the relation in the analytical percolation conduction model µ(Ne) = µ0 exp (−eφeff(Ne)/kBT ) [105]\nwith effective potential barrier height φeff(Ne) = φ 0 eff(Ne) −\na1 log Ne − a2 log2 Ne, where φ 0 eff(Ne) = φ0 − eσ 2 φ\n/(2kBT ) −\nEBM(Ne) is the effective barrier height measured from the Fermi level, and a1 and a2 are correction constants [106].\n\n## 5.7. Deep Subgap States: Off Current\n\nThe schematic electronic structure in figure 10(b) also shows an interesting structure above VBM. As observed in the hard x-ray photoemission spectrum (HX-PES) shown in figure 14(b), a-IGZO has a high density of occupied states above VBM with an energy width of ∼1.5 eV [107] (Note that the assignment of the valence band peaks is shown in figure 14(a), which will be compared with the density functional theory (DFT) calculation result in section 6.5). Much smaller but similar structures have also been reported in crystalline (Zn,Mg)O [108]. For a-IGZO, DFT calculations of oxygen-deficient a-IGZO suggest that a possible origin of these levels is an oxygen vacancy with a free space comparable to the size of an oxygen ion [109–111]. These deep states are important in understanding why a-IGZO TFTs do not exhibit an inversion operation, which is observed in\n\n![13_image_0.png](13_image_0.png)\n\n![13_image_1.png](13_image_1.png)\n\ncrystalline Si FETs and also in some a-Si:H TFTs as shown in figure 9(b).\n\nThe large band gap (∼3.2 eV) [107, 109, 110] and the strongly localized valence band in a-IGZO [110] cannot explain the flat Ioff at negative VGS in figure 7(b) because the standard MIS FET model predicts that holes are induced by the inversion of band bending at negative VGS markedly below the band-gap value. Therefore, one possible explanation for the low and flat Ioff is that the source/drain contacts form a strong Schottky contact for holes and block the hole current.\n\nThe device simulation in figure 15, based on the parameters and the subgap DOS model in [98], reveals that Ioff should\n\n![13_image_2.png](13_image_2.png)\n\nbe <10−20 A for an ideal TFT, which should be due to the Schottky contact for holes.\n\nHowever, it is difficult to believe that oxide semiconductors form a stable and good Schottky contact [112–114], because oxide semiconductor–metal contacts easily exhibit an ohmic behavior, which is explained by the formation of conductive layers by a reduction reaction [115]. As is known for poly-Si TFTs, direct contact between an electrode and a channel results in a strong electric field at the interface and causes a leakage current due to tunneling, hot electron injection and generationrecombination current by the Shockley–Reed–Hall (SRH)\nmechanism; therefore, a lightly doped drain structure is employed. A similar mechanism should apply to a-IGZO TFTs; although the band gap is much larger for a-IGZO, the SRH mechanism can still be efficient owing to the surface reduction layer having a high density of defect states.\n\nThe deep-subgap DOS above VBM in figure 14(b)\nprovides another possible explanation of the low Ioff. The subgap DOS extends up to ∼1.5 eV above VBM, and its density exceeds 1020 cm−3even for high-quality, weakly doped a-IGZO films [116]. This density is larger than the electron density that can be induced by VGS (<1018 cm−3),\nas estimated from the relation Ne ∼ CG · VGS/e based on the TFT dimensions in figure 7. In such a case, the Fermi level is pinned in the subgap DOS and thus there should be no mobile holes in the valence band. According to a recent angle-resolved hard x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (AR-HX-PES) study, the deep part of the DOS is mostly concentrated in the surface region [116], but it still remains a possible origin of the pinning centers because the detection limit of HX-PES is above 1019 cm−3, and such a density is still sufficiently high to pin the Fermi level in conventional TFT structures.\n\nFigure 14(b) shows the peak structure around the Fermi energy EF, suggesting that a high density of electrons exists near the conduction band. Similar structures have been reported in highly doped a-IZO [117] and can be attributed to doped electrons. We estimate the corresponding densities to be >5 × 1019, but these values are larger than the carrier density that can be induced by VGS and cannot be achieved in TFTs. The AR-HX-PES results showed no systematic relationship between the shallow DOS and the electron density measured using the Hall effect [116].\n\n## 5.8. Stability\n\nThe long-term stability and reliability of TFTs are the most important issues for their mass production. The stability of AOS TFTs has been intensively studied in recent years.\n\nAs mentioned above, a-IGZO TFTs have high mobilities of above 10 cm2 V\n−1s\n−1even when fabricated at room temperature; however, the uniformity and stability are poor for unannealed TFTs [118, 119]. Therefore, most a-IGZO TFTs in prototype displays have been annealed at a temperature above 300 ◦C (lower annealing temperatures have been applied recently). We reported that such high-temperature annealing is necessary to oxidize a-IGZO and reduce the concentration of native donor defects in as-deposited a-IGZO,\neven in a pure O2 atmosphere; electrical conductivity increases with annealing temperature up to ∼300 ◦C and then starts decreasing [118]. This result indicates that O2 molecules do not have sufficient oxidizing power to passivate the defects in a-IGZO below 300 ◦C. We also found that annealing is more effective in wet oxygen than in dry oxygen, which was attributed to the stronger oxidation power provided by H2O\nmolecules. Thermal annealing removes weak chemical bonds, 11  \nparticularly Zn–O-related bonds, and forms stable a-IGZO. Constant-current stress tests revealed that annealed a-IGZO TFTs are much more stable than unannealed TFTs with the saturation values of the Vth shift (1Vth) less than 2 V [119].\n\nSome groups, including ours, have reported that the time dependence of 1Vth follows a stretched exponential law [120, 121]. Most results of 1Vth under bias stress tests exhibit a positive shift, which is explained by the following contributions: the trapping of positive charges in (i) the gate insulator, (ii) the channel-gate insulator interface, (iii) the bulk of the channel and (iv) the back-channel surface, as well as (v) the creation of acceptor-type deep traps (i.e. unoccupied defects that can accept extra electrons) and (vi) a decrease in the donor concentration. Contribution (vi) can be ruled out because it is difficult to believe that the defect density can decrease during a degradation test. Regarding to our studies [86, 119], contribution (i) can also be excluded because we used stable thermally oxidized SiO2 formed on a Si wafer. But this mechanism is valid for other practical device structures that employ SiO2, SiON or SiNx gate insulators and are not formed by high-temperature oxidation of single-crystalline silicon.\n\nThere have been reports of other 1Vth(t) dependences.\n\nAn exponential dependence of 1Vth(t) has been reported for a constant–voltage stress test and explained by charge tunneling [122]. It is pointed out that most of the instability of bottom-gate a-IGZO TFTs with the back-channel surface exposed to the atmosphere originates from the adsorption/ desorption of oxygen and water molecules [123, 124]; they proposed a field-induced adsorption/desorption model [125].\n\nThe instability due to the exposed back channel is solved by adopting dense, gas-tight passivation layers (see, for example, [126]) and employing a top-gate structure in which the gates act as passivation layers [127]. Actually, most of the recent a-IGZO TFTs have employed passivation layers made of SiO2 [128], SiNx [93], Al2O3 [129, 130]\nor TiOx [3, 131]. It has also been found that the transfer characteristics of annealed a-IGZO TFTs under bias stress tests only exhibit parallel shifts; i.e. the values of S and mobility are not affected. This behavior is explained by the formation of deep traps, which reduce the density of free electrons in the channel.\n\nWe reported that this situation is different for unannealed TFTs fabricated at room temperature, which also exhibit the degradation of S values, and that the increase in the subgap DOS near CBM must also be considered [119]. This degradation is recovered by aging at room temperature in air for over 10 h [132]. We also observed that only applying negative-bias stress does not change Vth. The instability against positive bias stress discussed above and the high stability against negative-bias stress suggest that the positive-bias instability is related to the current flow. Uraoka and co-workers observed Joule heating by the drain current in a-IGZO TFTs and concluded that a positive 1Vth is induced by the gate voltage and that a negative 1Vth is induced by the drain voltage and is caused by the Joule heating [133].\n\nJeong *et al* [36] gave a good overview of the instability issues reflected in the above description.\n\n![15_image_0.png](15_image_0.png)\n\nMore recently, illumination stability and negative bias—light illumination (NBL) stability have become more important because the bias stability problem for annealed TFTs has almost been solved by employing passivation layers. The photoresponse of AOS TFTs was reported for a-Zn–Sn–O\nTFTs [134] and a-IGZO TFTs [135, 136]. As can be seen in the typical transfer characteristics under monochromatic illumination in figure 16(a) [86], a-IGZO TFTs respond to photon energies above 2.3 eV, which is lower than the band gap (3.1 eV). Illumination increases Ioff and induces negative parallel shifts of Vth. The threshold photon energy corresponds well to the energy levels of the subgap DOS above VBM\ndetected by HX-PES (figure 14(b)); therefore, it is attributed to the excitation of electrons from deep subgap states to the conduction band.\n\nA similar photoresponse is also observed in steady-state photocurrent measurements of a-IGZO films [137], which show that the mobility-lifetime product decays slowly with the corresponding Urbach energies of ∼0.24 eV for unannealed a-IGZO and ∼0.16 eV for annealed a-IGZO. The photoresponse is reversible and very slow with a time constant exceeding thousands of seconds. This is attributed to the relaxation of metastable donor states with activation energies of 0.9–1.1 eV, and a similar model was proposed by Takechi et al [136].\n\nAn enhanced negative Vth shift is observed if a negative bias is applied with illumination (i.e. NBL stress) [138].\n\nLee *et al* reported that the NBL stability depends on the quality of the initial a-IGZO layers; i.e. although initial performance of high-quality and low-quality a-IGZO TFTs 11  \nis similar, the latter are rapidly degraded by stress [139]. We found that low-quality films have a much higher deep-subgap DOS, although their Hall mobilities and TFT characteristics appear similar to those of high-quality films [4]. These results indicate that only the electrical characteristics themselves cannot be used as an indicator of film quality, and it is important to improve the film quality to as high as possible to produce stable a-IGZO TFTs.\n\nLee *et al* [140] proposed a hole-trap model to explain the NBL instability. In this model, photoexcitation occurs from the valence band to subgap electron traps; electrons are localized at the subgap traps and holes are transported to traps in a channel—gate insulator interface or a gate insulator. We consider a similar mechanism but with the Fermi level in the a-IGZO channels rather high in the band gap above 0.5 eV below CBM (i.e. ∼2.5 eV above VBM) for the usual electron density [5], and with a small subgap DOS near CBM as discussed in section 5.6; therefore, the excitation to electron traps cannot explain the photoresponse under the 2.3 eV subgap illumination (note that almost all the subgap states are fully occupied below the Fermi level). Therefore, we consider that the subgap photon excitation mostly occurs from the deep-subgap DOS to the conduction band. Lee et al [140] also pointed out that moisture enhances the NBL\ninstability [140]. Sony reported that the use of a dc-sputtered AlOx passivation layer suppressed the photoresponse to a cold cathode fluorescent lamp [130]. For poly-ZnO TFTs, the Kyoto University and Kochi University of Technology groups reported that the photoleakage current originates from the large photoresponse in the source region [141].\n\n## 5.9. Tft Modeling\n\nMany subgap DOS and mobility models and analytical models have been reported for a-IGZO TFTs; however, combined and unified models have not been established yet. Here, we simply list the references for device simulation models [98, 142, 143], DOS models based on C–V methods [99], combinations of C–V methods and device simulations [100–104, 106], mobility models [105, 144], subthreshold models based on the Meyer–Neldel rule [145, 146], temperature dependences [143, 147] and circuit design [148, 149].\n\n## 6. Fundamental Properties And Physics Of A-Igzo\n\n6.1. Origin of large electron mobility in a-IGZO:\npseudo-band structure Hereafter, we discuss the fundamental physics and properties of AOSs. The first issue is why AOS TFTs have a good performance superior to that of a-Si:H TFTs, even though both AOSs and a-Si:H are amorphous. Before the report on transparent amorphous oxide conductors in 1995 [24–27], amorphous conductors were thought to have poor electronic conductivity because of hopping conduction in the disordered structure. This is the case for a-Si:H, where both electrons and holes migrate by hopping and not by band conduction, which is why the electron mobilities are as low as <1 cm2 V\n−1s\n−1\n\n![16_image_0.png](16_image_0.png)\n\n(see section 5.4 and [87]). In contrast, the electron mobilities in AOSs easily exceed 10 cm2 V\n−1s\n−1, and band conduction is observed, as evidenced by the clear Hall voltage signals and the degenerated temperature dependence of the Hall mobility [1, 144, 150]. This difference is explained by chemical bonding in [4]. The sp3 hybridized orbitals that form the carrier transport paths in Si are markedly distorted by disorder and form deep localized states. This results in the hopping conduction and the low drift mobilities in a-Si:H. In contrast, the electron paths in oxides of typical metals are formed mainly by s orbitals of the metal cations, and the overlaps between the wave functions of adjacent metal cations are not altered significantly by the disorder in AOSs, thus enabling band conduction and high mobilities.\n\nThis chemical bonding view is supported by firstprinciples DFT calculations. Figure 17 shows pseudo-band structures of a-InGaZnO4 and a-Si. Note that band theory is not applicable to non-periodic systems, but periodic calculations are still helpful to for understanding the stable atomic configurations and the nature of chemical bonds even for amorphous materials. In particular, the width of a band in such a (pseudo-)band structure reflects the local effective mass and transfer integrals [151, 152]. Figure 17(a) shows that the CBM band at ∼0.7 eV has a large dispersion with a bandwidth of ∼1 eV, similar to that of crystalline InGaZnO4 (c-IGZO)\n(the band effective masses are calculated as m\n∗\n\ne = 0.2 me for a-IGZO [153] and 0.18 me for c-IGZO [111]), indicating that the electrons in a-IGZO are delocalized.\n\nCalculations for a-Si (performed for a Si64 unit cell using a similar procedure to that in [153]) show that all the bands have very small widths, much less than 0.5 eV, indicating the suppression of band conduction. The band dispersion in a-Si is markedly suppressed because of the strong spatial directivity of the sp3 hybridized orbitals.\n\nSimilar results were obtained for a-IGZO in the high-energy conduction band region above 3 eV and the valence band region. The former is formed mainly by the p orbitals of metal cations and the latter is formed by the p orbitals of oxygen ions, whereas the CBM band is mainly composed of the s orbitals of metal cations. These results support the chemical bonding considerations above. Note that the valence band dispersion is very small and that isolated bands are found (at –0.2–0 eV) in a-IGZO, indicating that holes are strongly localized.\n\n## 6.2. Carrier Transport Mechanism\n\nIn–Ga–Zn–O exhibits unusual carrier transport properties as shown in figure 13(a). In particular, (i) its electron mobility increases with increasing free-electron density, (ii) the maximum Hall mobility is similar for crystalline InGaO3(ZnO)m [154] and a-IGZO. The reason for (ii) is explained in section 6.1: the band dispersions, i.e. the effective masses, are similar for c-IGZO and a-IGZO because their CBM bands are formed by the s orbitals. Behavior (i) is opposite that of single-crystalline semiconductors, in which the carrier mobility usually decreases with increasing carrier density because of scattering on the ionized donors or acceptors.\n\nBehavior (i) is explained by a percolation conduction model [105, 144, 150, 154]. As illustrated in figure 13(b), a distribution of potential barriers is formed above CBM\nowing to the disordered structure. Electrons take shorter transport paths at high temperatures even if these paths have high potential barriers (path (i) in figure 13(b)). They take a longer path (ii) with lower barriers at lower temperatures because they do not have sufficient thermal energy to pass the high potential barriers. In this model, the distribution of the potential barrier heights is characterized by the center energy\n(φ0) and distribution width (σφ). The model reproduces the temperature (T ) dependences of Hall measurements as shown in figures 18(a) and (b). The distributed potential barriers result in the deviation from simple thermal activation; i.e. the Arrhenius plot of conductivity (σ) shows nonlinear behavior in figure 18(b) and a better straight line is obtained in the log σ ∼ T\n−n(n ∼ 1/4) plot. Such behavior is usually explained by Mott's variable-range hopping, but it cannot be applied to a-IGZO because this material exhibits clear Hall voltage signals.\n\nAt intermediate electron densities, a weak localization behavior is observed in which σ follows the relation σ (T ) =\nσ0 + ηT\np/2 + λT\n1/2. Here σ0, η and λ are constants and p reflects the carrier scattering mechanism. For example, p = 1 corresponds to photon scattering [155–157]. This behavior can be explained by the percolation conduction model. Weak localization is also observed in amorphous In–O and In–Zn–O\nand is confirmed by the magnetic field response [158–161]. At lower electron densities, a Hall voltage anomaly appears in a-IGZO films at low temperatures (<120 K) as seen in the deviation of the calculated electron densities from the measured values (figure 18(a)).\n\nSemiconductor statistics analysis of nHall(T ) data yields donor levels at 100–150 meV for c-IGZO and at 110 meV below CBM for a-IGZO [105], and the percolation conduction model indicates that the potential barriers have an average height of 40–120 meV and a width of 20–30 meV as shown in figure 18(c).\n\nIt would also be interesting to examine the Meyer-Neldel\n(MN) rule [162], which is valid for many semiconductors\n\n![17_image_0.png](17_image_0.png)\n\nincluding a-Si:H [163, 164]. Conventionally σ is expressed as σ = σ0 exp(−Ea/kBT ), where σ0 is a prefactor and Ea is the activation energy. The MN rule indicates that ln σ0 and Ea are linearly related, i.e. σ0 = σ00 exp(AEa), A > 0, and this behavior in a-Si:H is related to the localized tail states [165]. The ln σ0–Ea plot is presented in figure 18(d),\nbut both c-IGZO and a-IGZO exhibit negative values of A. This behavior is called the 'anti-MN rule' and is observed, for example, in hydrogenated microcrystalline silicon (µc-Si:H) [166]. A regular MN relation was reported for a-IGZO TFTs [145, 146] in a large Ea region that corresponds to a low VGS and a low carrier density (Ne).\n\nThis changes to the anti-MN rule for low Ea < 80 meV [146],\nwhich is consistent with the data in figure 18(d) and similar to the case of µc-Si:H.\n\nLet us consider effective masses. The effective mass of a-IGZO (In:Ga:Zn = 1:1:1) is estimated to be ∼0.34 me from free-carrier absorption in highly doped a-IGZO films [150].\n\nThis value is similar to that of c-IGZO (0.32 me) and is consistent with the chemical bonding view discussed in section 6.1. Medvedeva [167] reports that electron effective masses in multicomponent transparent oxides can be estimated from their chemical composition. Canon investigated AOSs in the In-X-O system (X = Al, Si, Ge, etc)\nwith various compositions and found a clear relation between the estimated effective mass and µsat [168, 169].\n\nAs described above, it is easy to obtain a Hall mobility above 10 cm2 V\n−1s\n−1for a-IGZO (In : Ga : Zn = 1 : 1 : 1),\nbut larger mobilities are obtained for In-rich and Ga-poor compositions [170]. Especially, Zn-doped amorphous indium of a-IZO increases with increasing Ne for Ne < 1020 cm−3 and decreases at higher Ne. Such a decrease at high Ne is not observed for a-IGZO, while the increase in mobility with Ne extends to a wider range of Ne. It should be noted that the decrease in µ in the high Ne range is attributed not to conventional ionized impurity scattering but to other defects which are responsible for the 'gray' optical absorption in highly doped a-IZO.\n\nIn figure 19, the optical band gap is plotted against N\n2/3 e for a-IGZO [5] and a-IZO [171]. The figure shows that the optical band gap increases with increasing Ne, which is due to the band-filling effect, that is, the Burstein–Moss shift 1E\nBM\ng\n\n$$\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{g}}^{\\mathrm{BM}}=\\frac{h^{2}}{m_{\\mathrm{de}}}\\left(\\frac{3N_{\\mathrm{e}}}{16\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\right)^{2/3}.\\qquad\\qquad(7)$$\n\nThe DOS effective mass mde is obtained from the slope of this plot to be ∼0.56 me for a-IZO. For a-IGZO, the 1E\nBM\ng − N\n2/3 e plot does not follow a straight line, which might be due to the nonparabolic bands or the band-narrowing effect [5].\n\n## 6.3. Optical Properties\n\nBand gap values of AOSs are usually estimated from a Tauc plot [172], which has the form αE = [B(E − Eg)]\nr(α is the absorption coefficient, E is the photon energy, and B and r are constants). Assuming parabolic bands and the vanishing of the k-selection rule for optical transitions, which is valid for a crystal, r = 2 is usually employed in the Tauc plot. The estimated band gap (Tauc gap) is ∼3.2 eV for high-quality a-IGZO films (In : Ga : Zn = 1 : 1 : 1) and tends to decrease to\n∼3.0 eV for poor-quality films. It has also been reported that the Tauc-Lorentz model [173, 174] closely fits to the optical spectra of a-IGZO and c-IGZO [110, 175]. As discussed in relation to the deep subgap DOS and the NBL instability in sections 5.6–5.8, subgap optical absorption is important for the TFT stability [86]. It was found that optical absorption\n\n![18_image_0.png](18_image_0.png)\n\nspectra just below the band gap follow the Urbach law with an Urbach energy of ∼150 meV [109].\n\nOptical spectra also provide information about the subgap DOS. The a-IGZO films in figure 20 have band gaps of 3.0–3.2 eV, but there is observable optical absorption in the photon energy range from 2.0 eV to the band gap values\n(figures 20(b) and (c)). The widths of these subgap optical absorption features correspond well to the deep-subgap DOS\nabove VBM observed by HX-PES in figure 14(b), and they are considered to have the same origin.\n\n## 6.4. Structure Analysis\n\nIt is difficult to deduce the atomic structure of an amorphous material. The structure of AOSs was studied by grazing-incidence x-ray scattering (GIXS) and x-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) combined with molecular dynamics (MD), reverse Monte–Carlo simulations and DFT\ncalculations. Utsuno *et al* have reported the structures of a-In2O3 [176] and a-IZO [177] and found the number of edge-sharing network structures decreases and the number of In–Zn corner-sharing structures increases with increasing Zn content. We constructed a-IGZO models from MD/DFT\ncalculations based on the coordination structure obtained from XAFS, which showed that the coordination numbers around the cations are similar but slightly smaller than those in the corresponding crystals [5, 153]. Cho *et al* reported that the coordination structure of the Zn ions is distorted; they suggested that holes are localized on the Zn atoms [178]\nas on the basis of a DFT result for crystalline ZnO [179].\n\nThis view of the localized holes is consistent with DFT\npseudo-band calculations for a-IGZO [110, 111], but the verification of hole states is very difficult for a-IGZO because it is a wide-band-gap n-type semiconductor with almost no holes, unless illuminated.\n\nThe common conclusions of these studies are (i) the nearest-neighbor bond distances are similar in AOSs and \n\n![18_image_1.png](18_image_1.png)\n\nthe corresponding crystals, (ii) the coordination numbers of cations are similar or slightly smaller than those in the corresponding crystals (e.g. 4.5–6 for In, 4.3–5 for Ga-O\nand 4.6–5 for Zn-O), (iii) InOn polyhedra tend to form edge-sharing networks. The In-In distances are different between crystalline In2O3, c-IGZO and a-IGZO because of different angles in the connecting InOn polyhedra.\n\n## 6.5. Electronic Structures, Doping, Impurities And Defects\n\nThere have been several reports on theoretical calculations of the electronic structure and defects in c-IGZO [181–186] and a-IGZO [109–111, 153, 185, 187]. The pseudo-band structure is shown in figure 17(b) and the projected DOS is shown in figure 21, which corresponds to the peak in the valence band of HX-PES in figure 14(b). The calculated energy levels are underestimated because DFT provides energy levels as types of chemical potentials [188], which are smaller than ionization\n\n 11  \n\n![19_image_0.png](19_image_0.png)\n\npotentials. In addition, it is known that the incorporation of Coulomb repulsion is important for Zn 3d electrons [179] because omission of it raises the energy levels of Zn 3d and results in an overestimation of the Zn 3d–O 2p interaction and the VBM dispersion and in the further underestimation of the band gap.\n\nDFT calculations have provided the following information. Different structures with different densities from 5.8 to 6.1 g cm−3can be stable ([153] and unpublished data). The film density measured by grazing-incidence x-ray reflectivity (GIXRR) was ∼6.1 g cm−3. This value is ∼4%\nsmaller than that of crystalline InGaZnO4 (x-ray density, 6.379 g cm−3) but is in good agreement with the DFT results.\n\nOxygen deficiency in a-IGZO results in both deep, fully occupied states and shallow donor states in the band gap, which depend on the local structure of the oxygen defect [109]. A large open space in the structure traps electrons and forms a deep level similar to the deep-subgap DOS observed by HX-PES. It simultaneously forms a shallow unoccupied trap because the coherence of the CBM band is broken by the vacancy site [110]. If such a large open space is not formed in oxygen-deficient a-IGZO, then shallow donor states are formed that contributes to the enhancement of electronic conductivity.\n\nFigure 22 shows several oxygen deficiency structures. If an oxygen vacancy site is coordinated by a small number of cations (a) or if it is adjacent to a large open space (b), then deep traps and shallow traps are formed, whereas if an oxygen vacancy site is coordinated by a large number of cations with dense edge-sharing networks, then a shallow donor state is created. Whereas this tendency does not always hold, numerous calculations have confirmed it to be a general trend. This implies that the elimination of open spaces should be effective for making high-quality a-IGZO\nwith fewer defects. Jeong *et al* came to a similar conclusion.\n\nThey reported a variation in the a-IGZO density from 5.50 to 6.27 g cm−3for different deposition conditions; denser films had smaller S values and thus fewer defects [189].\n\nWe speculate that such an open space may also be related to the metastable donor states observed by steady-state photoconductivity measurements [137].\n\nDFT calculations provide the defect formation energies summarized in figure 23. The minimum formation energies are 2.0 eV for an oxygen vacancy (VO), 6.1 eV for an indium vacancy (VIn), 4.0 eV for a zinc vacancy (VZn) and 5.1 eV for a gallium vacancy (VGa) at the reduction limit. Takechi *et al* estimated the defect formation energy from the temperature dependences of TFT characteristics. They obtained a value of 1.05 eV, which corresponds to an activation energy of 0.35 eV [147]. This value is, however, much smaller than the high-temperature (<300 ◦C) conductivity activation energies of 0.65–1.5 eV [118], which correspond to the defect formation energies of 2–4.5 eV and agree well with the DFT\nresults. Figure 23 also provides the formation energies of other defects such as O–O and metal–metal (M–M) linkages, as well as that of excess hydrogen at a bond center (Hi) at the reduction limit, showing that these defects can be easily formed in a-IGZO.\n\nRegarding hydrogen doping, DFT calculations showed that the incorporation of a hydrogen atom into a-IGZO\nalways results in a shallow donor state [110, 111], but the incorporation of a H2 molecule would not change the chemical bonds and electronic structure (unpublished).\n\nIt has been reported that a-IGZO films deposited by sputtering contain hydrogen with a concentration above 3 ×\n1020 cm−3 which further increases to 2 × 1021 cm−3 with increasing H2O pressure during the deposition; however TFTs using these a-IGZO channels exhibit a positive Vth [190].\n\nOn the other hand, we observed that the low-temperature\n(∼200 ◦C) annealing of a-IGZO films in a diluted H2 gas increases the carrier density to ∼1020 cm−3. These results appear contradictory but can be explained using the DFT results and the electronic structure in figure 10(b).\n\nDFT calculations for H-incorporated a-IGZO suggest that hydrogen atoms, but not molecules, form –OH bonds and shallow donors. In addition, even if the incorporated hydrogen creates donors, they might be compensated by the deep traps as observed by HX-PES. This is an important issue to be clarified in the near future.\n\n## References\n\n[1] Nomura K, Ohta H, Takagi A, Kamiya T, Hirano M and Hosono H 2004 *Nature* 432 488\n[2] Kim H D, Park J-S, Mo Y G and Kim S S 2009 *9th Int.*\nMeeting on Information Display (12–16 October 2009, Seoul, Korea) 3-1\n[3] Hung M-C, Lin W-T, Chang J J, Chen P-L, Wu C-Y, Lin C-J,\nChiu H-L, Huang C-Y and Kao Y-C 2010 Int.

Several excellent review papers regarding metal oxide TFTs in terms of fundamental electron structure, device process and reliability have been published. In particular, the required field-effect mobility of TMO TFTs has been increasing rapidly to meet the demands of the ultra-high-resolution, large panel size and three dimensional visual effects as a megatrend of flat panel displays, such as liquid crystal displays, organic light emitting diodes and flexible displays. In this regard, the effects of the TMO composition on the performance of the resulting oxide TFTs has been reviewed, and classified into binary, ternary and quaternary composition systems. In addition, the new strategic approaches including zinc oxynitride materials, double channel structures, and composite structures have been proposed recently, and were not covered in detail in previous review papers. Special attention is given to the advanced device architecture of TMO TFTs, such as back-channel-etch and self-aligned coplanar structure, which is a key technology because of their advantages including low cost fabrication, high driving speed and unwanted visual artifact-free high quality imaging. The integration process and related issues, such as etching, post treatment, low ohmic contact and Cu interconnection, required for realizing these advanced architectures are also discussed.\n\nKeywords: field-effect transistors, metal oxide, high performance\n(Some figures may appear in colour only in the online journal)\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nTransition metal oxide (TMO) semiconductors with n-type conductivity have attracted enormous attention as a channel layer of pixel switching transistors in the area of active matrix devices, such as liquid crystal displays (LCDs) and organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), because they offer intriguing properties, such as high mobility, good transparency to visible light, low temperature process capability and relatively low fabrication cost compared to silicon-based semiconductors\n[1, 2]. In particular, the conduction band of TMO materials is associated with overlap of the ns orbitals of transition cations, such as zinc, indium and tin. Their non-directionality allows disordering-independent carrier mobility, low trap state density and good uniformity of the resulting TMO TFTs [3, 4].\n\nThe applications of flat-panel AM displays include mobile telephones, tablets, monitors, and televisions according to the panel size. Traditional amorphous Si (a-Si) and low temperature polycrystalline silicon (LPTS) backplanes are still the mainstream for such products. In the case of mobile telephones, the LPTS thin film transistors (TFTs) array is rapidly penetrating the high-end LCD and OLED products because 0268-1242/15/024002+16$33.00 1 © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd Printed in the UK\nthey exhibit very high mobility (>80 cm2 Vs−1), excellent electrical stability and good form factor. On the other hand, televisions, which have the largest market volume among the various applications, is driven by a-Si TFT arrays. This is due to the large size uniformity, scalability and low fabrication cost of a-Si backplane technology [5, 6]. The application of TMO electronics to practical products depends on the design specifications of each panel. For mobile applications, TMO\nTFTs with high mobility compatible to the LTPS counterpart need to be developed. Considering that the typical mobility of In2Ga2ZnO7 TFTs is approximately 10 cm2 Vs−1 in the 30 (2015) 024002 J Yeon Kwon and J Kyeong Jeong\n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)\n\nmanufacturing line, it is imperative to develop an advanced composition and device structure of TMO TFTs with high field-effect mobility (>30 cm2 Vs−1), as shown in figure 1. Although higher mobility (>20 cm2 Vs−1) can be achieved for In-rich IGZO films [7–9], the reliable and production grade composition of the IGZO channel layer for TFTs is limited in the flat panel display industry. For the large size television applications, the most important aspect is the low fabrication cost. TMO TFTs can be fabricated without an intentional crystallization and ion doping process, which are essential processes for LPTS TFTs. Therefore, TMO TFTs are potentially attractive for low cost fabrication. The overall panel cost of flat panels is determined by the architecture of the TFTs, which can be classified as a bottom gate, top gate or coplanar structure. The most popular architecture of a-Si TFTs is a bottom gate structure (figures 2(a) and (b)), where the source/\ndrain electrode is formed on the semiconducting layer. In particular, the back-channel-etch (BCE) type is preferred due to the simplicity of the process and the lowest use of photomask steps (figure 2(b)). On the other hand, TMO TFTs, which have been studied thus far, are the etch stopper (ES)\ntype because the TMO channel is attacked easily by S/D\npatterning damage (figure 2(a)). Therefore, the development of TMO TFTs with a BCE type is essential for reducing the fabrication cost.\n\nHigh resolution (⩾200 ppi) and high frequency frame\n(⩾240 Hz) driving have become a megatrend for the next generation active-matrix (AM) displays, which enable a vivid image and a natural motion picture in the resulting display. On the other hand, these requirements shorten the scan line selection time, leading to insufficient charging (image error)\n\n![2_image_1.png](2_image_1.png)\n\n 30 (2015) 024002 J Yeon Kwon and J Kyeong Jeong extensive efforts are needed including high mobility, low resistance and low capacitance with the aim to reduce the resistive-capacitive (RC) delay (figure 1). In addition, undesirable visual artifacts, such as flicker and image sticking, etc, can be aggravated by the displacement current caused by parasitic capacitive coupling. In particular, the kick-back effect due to the parasitic capacitance of TFTs is the origin for the flicker and image sticking problem in AMLCD and AMOLED panels, respectively [10]. Therefore, the design and fabrication of TFT arrays with a low parasitic capacitance, such as a self-aligned coplanar structure, is also a technically important issue (figure 2(c)).\n\nSeveral excellent review papers on TMO TFTs in terms of the fundamental electron structure, device process and reliability have been published [11–14]. In this review, the novel channel composition and channel structure reported recently focused on the In-Zn-Sn-O (IZTO), zinc oxynitride (ZnON) semiconductor, double channel and hybrid composite channel. The sputtering technique is the most commonly used method for preparing TMO films because of its higher performance and superior electrical or photo stability compared to the counterpart of the solution-based processing. Kim et al recently reviewed solution processed TMO and related devices, which have the advantages of a simple process, low cost and high throughput [15]. Beside the traditional ES type device, BCE type TMO TFTs with the merit of process simplicity and short channel device are also addressed in terms of the etching, treatment, passivation and copper (Cu)\nline processes. Finally, the fabrication process and issues of TMO TFTs with a self-aligned coplanar structure are reviewed, which enables realization of a visual artifact-free image in the resulting AM displays.\n\n## 2. Compositional Approach For High Performance Tft 2.1. Binary Tmo Semiconductor\n\nBinary oxides, such as ZnO, In2O3 and SnO2, have a wide band gap (>3.0 eV) and high electrical conductivity, which can be attributed to native defects, such as oxygen vacancies, cation interstitials, hydrogen, which act as shallow donors\n[16–18]. These oxides have high electron mobility even when they are amorphous, which originates from the intercalation of the ns orbital of the cations [19, 20]. For these reasons, these oxides have been considered widely as the base materials for amorphous semiconductors. Since the first report of ZnO TFTs by Hoffman et al [21], the performance of ZnO\nTFTs have been improved steadily by optimizing the sputtering process or solution process [22–25]. Recently, modification of the device structure, such as the vertical channel\n[26] and dual gate [27], has been also reported using a ZnO\nsemiconductor. On the other hand, ZnO is a polycrystalline material that is unsuitable as a channel material for TFTs because of its non-uniformity [1, 17, 28]. Therefore, the key issue for ZnO semiconductors is to obtain grain boundary-free uniform properties, which should not be compromised by any\n\n![3_image_0.png](3_image_0.png)\n\ndegradation of the high electron mobility, via a simple process. The extraordinary mobility of ∼120 cm2 Vs−1 was previously reported for InOx TFTs with an organic dielectric.\n\nDespite this, these devices suffer from a large off-state current and low Ion/off ratio of ∼105 presumably due to the high leakage current of the organic dielectric and/or the high conductivity of the InOx channel layer itself [29].\n\n## 2.2. Ternary Tmo Semiconductor\n\nWith the viewpoint of large area uniformity, the ternary TMO\nsemiconductor would be promising because a multi-component cation system is immune to crystallization under a given processing condition. InZnO (IZO) is the representative ternary system. In2O3 and ZnO have the bixbyite and wurtzite crystal structure, respectively. Owing to the different geometrical hindrances, the two components have also different cation coordination numbers, which allow the resulting IZO\nalloy to be an amorphous phase. In addition, the resistivity of IZO films varies dynamically from 10−4 to 108 Ωcm by controlling the cation composition and cation/oxygen nonstoichiometry. This means that the IZO film can be used as either a transparent conducting electrode or channel layer of TFTs for FPD application [30–33]. On the other hand, the IZO film exhibits a high free electron density (Ne) because of the easy formation of oxygen vacancy defects, which deteriorates the off-state current and photobias stability of the resulting IZO TFTs. For example, a high mobility of\n>100 cm2 Vs−1 was reported for the IZO TFTs with a good Ion/off ratio of 107 [34], but the NBIS stability of the IZO TFTs was not studied. Recently, IZO TFTs with high mobility\n(>30 cm2 Vs−1) have been reported (figure 3), where the photobias stability was reinforced by oxygen high pressure annealing [35].\n\nZnSnO (ZTO) is another ternary class material that easily forms an amorphous phase. In contrast, the ZTO system is much cheaper than the IZO system. Therefore, there have been many reports regarding the promising performance of TFTs with a ZTO channel layer [36–43]. The stability of ZTO\nTFTs was improved by either optimizing the Zn/Sn ratio [38] or controlling the passivation process [41]. On the other hand, it is difficult to pattern tin-rich ZTO by wet etching. Moreover, the device instability of ZTO TFTs under bias thermal stress (BTS), light illumination or negative bias illumination stress (NBIS) conditions require further improvement.\n\n## 2.3. Quaternary Tmo Semiconductor\n\nA low Ne (<1017 cm3) is a key technical parameter for achieving highly stable TMO TFTs. In the case of binary or ternary TMO systems, moderate n-type doping can be controlled by the cation/anion non-stoichiometry or process optimization. An alternative approach is to introduce an extra component, which is called a carrier suppressor. Gallium (Ga)\nis a representative carrier suppressor for the IZO system.\n\nNomura et al reported high performance TFTs with an IGZO\nchannel, where Ne was reduced by the Ga fraction [1]. This reduction of Ne can be explained by the high ionic field strength of the Ga ion, which allows oxygen to be bound tightly and prevents the formation of oxygen vacancies\n[1, 20, 28, 44]. In the IGZO TFTs, the carrier mobility generally increased with increasing In content (decreasing Ga content), which can be explained by the increasing Ne.\n\nTherefore, high mobility (>20 cm2 Vs−1) can be achieved for TFTs with an In-rich IGZO channel composition [7–9]. Many other carrier suppressors, which are similar to the Ga ion, have been suggested for IZO and ZTO. Hafnium (Hf) was proposed as an effective carrier suppressor for the IZO semiconductor\n[45]. The fabricated HIZO TFTs exhibited reasonable device performance with a field-effect mobility of ∼10 cm2 Vs−1, and high Ion/off ratio of >108. The photobias stability of the HIZO\nTFTs was improved further by either choosing a SiO2 dielectric as a gate insulator [46] or adopting a double etch stop layer\n[47]. Park et al reported highly stable Zr-doped IZO (ZIZO)\nTFTs, where the ZrO2 was introduced as a carrier suppressor\n[48]. The Ne in the ZIZO films decreased from 4 × 1016 cm−3 to 1 × 1014 cm−3 with increasing Zr fraction. The ZIZO TFTs annealed at 350 °C for 2 h. exhibited a field-effect mobility of 3.9 cm2 Vs−1, SS factor of 0.98 V/decade, Vth of 1.6 V, and an Ion/Ioff ratio of ∼107. The constant current stress (IDS = 3 μA,\nVDS= 10 V, 60 h.) stability (ΔVth= 1.0 V) of the ZIZO TFTs was superior to that (ΔVth= 3.4 V) of IGZO TFTs. Titanium\n[49, 50], aluminium [51, 52], tantalum [53], strontium [54],\nbarium [54], scandium [55], magnesium [56], lanthanum [57], and gadolinium [58] exhibit similar carrier suppressor behavior in the IZO-based system, as shown in figure 4.\n\nOne promising composition toward high mobility in quaternary TMO materials is the IZTO semiconductor [59].\n\nThe role of the Sn cation is controversial. Sn4+ acts as a mobility enhancer, which is similar to In3+. Therefore, the observed high mobility in the IZTO transistor can be explained by the efficient cooperative intercalation of the ns orbital of In3+ and Sn4+ cations. On the other hand, the metastable Sn2+ ion can trap the carrier as tailing states in the\n\n 30 (2015) 024002 J Yeon Kwon and J Kyeong Jeong\n\n![4_image_0.png](4_image_0.png)\n\nforbidden band-gap of the IZTO semiconductor [60]. High temperature annealing under an oxidizing atmosphere favors the Sn2+ to Sn4+ transition in the TMO film. Figures 5(a) and\n(b) shows the transfer characteristics and mobility variations of the representative IZTO TFTs with the atomic ratio of In:\nZn: Sn = 40: 36: 24. A high mobility of 52.4 cm2 Vs−1 and low SS factor of 0.2 V/decade were observed without a deterioration of the off-state drain current and Vth value (Ion/off ratio > 2 × 108, Vth∼0.1 V) [61]. On the other hand, the introduction of a carrier suppressor in the IZO system tended to reduce the mobility of the TFTs (so called percolation conduction), even though it improved substantially the resistance of the TFTs against an external gate bias stress and photobias stability. The strong trade-off between the mobility and stability of TMO TFTs will be described in the next section.\n\n## 2.4. Oxynitride Semiconductor\n\nThe cation composition has been modified mainly to improve the stability of TMO TFTs under bias and illumination stress. An entirely different approach was proposed using ZnON as a channel layer [62, 63]. The substitution of an oxygen anion with a nitrogen anion in ZnO reduces the energy band gap of ZnON to 1.3 eV, which eliminates the oxygen deficient-\n\n![5_image_0.png](5_image_0.png)\n\n![5_image_1.png](5_image_1.png)\n\nrelated deep levels near the valence band maximum. Therefore, the photobias stability of the resulting ZnON TFTs becomes comparable to that of the LTPS TFTs (figure 6 ) [ 63 ].\n\nSimultaneously, a high mobility of >40 cm 2 Vs 2 can be achieved due to the effective small electron mass in ZnON\nfilms. On the other hand, the severe stretch-out of the subthreshold drain current suggests the existence of huge tailing trap states that need to be resolved.\n\n## 3.1. Double Channel Structure\n\nIn a-IGZO system, the wave function of the ns orbital of In 3+\noverlaps first and forms delocalized states in the conduction band because the indium ion has the largest ionic size among the various cations. The increasing In content in the a-IGZO\n 30 (2015) 024002 J Yeon Kwon and J Kyeong Jeong film gives rise to a simultaneous increase in Hall mobility and Ne, which can be explained by the formation of shallow oxygen vacancies that is facilitated by increasing the coordination number of In ions around a given oxygen atom. In particular, the proportional relationship between the carrier density and mobility can be understood by a so-called percolation conduction mechanism. This means that the enhancement in the field-effect mobility by increasing In content normally accompanies the serious degradation in both off-state drain current and Ion/off ratio in the IGZO TFTs. This tradeoff relation limits the use of the In fraction to achieve high mobility. The photo bias stability of metal oxide TFTs can also be aggravated seriously by the increasing In fraction.\n\nMost oxygen vacancies except for a few oxygen vacancy species were calculated to be an inactive and deep state in the forbidden energy gap of IGZO materials [2]. The exposure of photons (>2.2 eV) on the IGZO material causes the photoionization of neutral oxygen vacancies (VO) to meta-stable positively-charged oxygen vacancies (VO\n2+). During the photoionization process, the two electrons (VO → VO\n2+ + 2e−)\nreleased gives rise to photon-induced electron doping, which results in a negative shift of Vth in the IGZO TFTs [11].\n\nTherefore, achieving a high field-effect mobility without the degradation of photobias stability is a challenge. As an alternative approach, the double-channel structure can provide a solution to the adverse tradeoff between the field-effect mobility and photo-bias stability [64–68].\n\nAll double-channel devices studied had a bottom gate and top contact configuration. The channel layer consisted of a front layer and back layer. The front channel layer inserted between the gate dielectric film and back channel layer plays the role of the mobility booster, whereas the back channel layer strengthens the resistance of the TFTs to external gate bias and light stress. Therefore, the physical thickness (tint)\nand Ne of the interfacial front layer is a critical factor for determining the overall device performance of the double channel TFTs. A reasonable window for the interfacial layer in terms of the tint and Ne values can be expected, which does not cause any degradation of the Vth and Ioff parameters.\n\nGiven that the Ne of the interfacial channel layer is much larger than that of the back channel layer, it can be assumed that the Vth and Ioff values for the double channel TFTs are determined by the conducting front layer. First, to sustain the low Ioff value, the tint value should be smaller than the depletion thickness (xdepl = (2ε0Ksϕs/qNd)\n1/2, where ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, Ks is the relative dielectric constant of a semiconductor, ϕs is the channel surface bending and q is the elementary charge), which corresponds to guide line (i)\nin figure 7. Second, the total number (q(tint)Ne) of free electrons in the channel must be less than the number of charge carriers (QG) induced by the gate dielectric capacitor\n(QG =CiVGS = ε0KGIVGS∣tGI, where Ks is the relative dielectric constant of the gate insulator, and tGI is the gate insulator thickness), which determines guide line (ii). The tint-dependent Ne values should belong to the shaded area for the suitable operation of transistors. Otherwise, the device would suffer from either a large negative Vth value and/or a large Ioff current. Kim et al reported high performance TFTs with a\n\n![6_image_0.png](6_image_0.png)\n\nIDS (A)\n\n![6_image_2.png](6_image_2.png)\n\n![6_image_1.png](6_image_1.png)\n\ndouble-channel structure consisting of a thick back IGZO and thin front IZO (or ITO) layer, as shown in figure 8 [64]. TFTs with a single 70 nm thick IGZO channel exhibited a moderate mobility of 19.2 cm2 Vs−1, Vth of −0.6 V and an Ioff value of 5.7 × 10−13 A. A substantially higher mobility of 55.2 cm2 Vs−1 was obtained for TFTs with a single 30 nm thick IZO channel layer. The Vth value of the IZO TFTs, however, degraded to − 8.2 V. The improved mobility and degraded Vth value of the IZO FETs was attributed to the high Ne of the IZO channel layer, even though the actual Ne values of the IZO films were not characterized. In contrast, the double channel TFTs with a back IGZO(70 nm)/front IZO\n(5 nm) showed a high mobility of 51.3 cm2 Vs−1 and a low Ioff of 4.7 × 10−13 A without sacrificing the Vth value (∼0.3 V).\n\n![7_image_0.png](7_image_0.png)\n\nJ Yeon Kwon and J Kyeong Jeong\nThis suggests that the conducting interfacial IZO or ITO between IGZO and the SiO 2 film induces the high mobility of the resulting TFTs. The thickness of the conducting IZO or ITO layer should be controlled carefully because the thick IZO or ITO layer (>8 nm) in the double channel TFTs can cause a huge negative V th value [ 64 ]. The concept of a conducting channel path as an enabler of high mobility was confirmed in the IGZO TFTs with a buried channel of the GO film [ 65 ]. The insertion of a conducting GZO film with a carrier density of 3.9 × 10 19 cm − 3 between the semiconducting IGZO and SiO 2 dielectric film allowed enhanced mobility and better positive bias stress (PBS) stability of the resulting TFTs compared to those of the TFTs with a single IGZO channel. The result of a device simulation indicated that the screening length of the buried channel device was smaller than that of the single IGZO device when the positive gate voltage was applied. The insensitive surface potential variation near the channel region of the buried channel device resulted in less trapping of the charge carriers, which allowed better PBS stability of the resulting TFTs.\n\nThe thickness effect of the thin front ITO film on the transporting property and PBS/negative gate bias stress\n(NBS) induced instability in the double-channel Zn 0.7 Sn 0.3 O\n(ZTO)/In 0.9 Sn 0.1 O(ITO) TFTs was investigated in detail. The PBS and NBS stability as well as the mobility of the ZTO/\nITO TFTs were improved with increasing tint (<3.5 nm)\ncompared to those of the single channel ZTO device, which was attributed to a decrease in the effective interfacial trap density. The ZTO/ITO(4.5 nm) TFTs, however, suffered from inferior NBS stability to that of single channel ZTO TFTs, whereas their mobility was enhanced further to 45.0 cm 2 Vs −1\n[ 67 ]. The density-of-state (DOS)-based design concept was proposed for the double-channel TMO TFTs. The DOS-based Hf 0.10 In 0.35 Zn 0.55 O(HIZO)/In 0.85 Zn 0.15 O(IZO)\noptimized TFTs exhibited superior BTS stability as well as a higher mobility of 48.0 cm 2 Vs − 1 compared to those of the single channel HIZO or IZO TFTs [ 68 ]. On the other hand, the fundamental and puzzling question is why the optimal front channel thickness ( tint ) for high performance TFTs without an accompanying deterioration of the BTS stability was approximately 3 ∼5 nm (see figures 9(a) and (b)). The indepth theoretical calculation indicated that Sn-doped In0.74Zn0.26O (IZO) has a ∼0.3 eV larger formation energy of oxygen vacancies than IZO. Therefore, the in-diffusion of Sn ions to the front IZO layer during thermal annealing can allow the high resistance of the resulting TFT against NBIS. Nevertheless, the double channel device with a thick front IZO layer would exhibit inferior NBIS stability due to the limited diffusion length of Sn (3∼ 5 nm) [69]. This double channel approach can be a solution to resolving the tradeoff between the high mobility and stability. On the other hand, the optimal thickness of the front indium-rich TMO layer is so small that it would be a challenge to secure the thickness uniformity of the front layer over the large size glass substrate. In this regard, the development of a novel deposition technique, such as atomic layer deposition, should be considered.\n\nTFTs with a multiple channel structure consisting of 7 pairs of In2O3/Ga2O3 showed high mobility (51.3 cm2 Vs−1)\nand Ion/off ratio (108), which was attributed to the reduction in the subgap states [70]. The TFT with a superlattice channel consisting of a ZnO/Al2O3 stack was reported to exhibit better transporting and gate bias stress stability than those with a single ZnO channel, as shown in figure 10. The superior performance of the ZnO/Al2O3 superlattice TFTs was attributed to the quantum confinement effect, improved crystallinity of the ZnO channel and passivation effect of the Al2O3 film [71].\n\nThe electrical properties of the TMO semiconductor can be tailored by adopting a composite structure. The hybrid channel structure consisting of sol-gel processed In0.50Zn0.50O/single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) was used to produce high performance, flexible TFTs. This composite channel device exhibited a high mobility of 140 cm2 Vs−1, whereas a high Ion/off ratio of ∼107 was maintained [72]. The reason for the high mobility is that the SWNTs in a composite channel provide a fast carrier path owing to their ballistic transporting properties. Similar to the composite approach, nanometer dot doping (NDD) in the In1/3Ga1/3Zn1/3O film allowed an increase in the conductivity of the channel layer and thus the carrier mobility of the resulting IGZO TFTs [73]. The coating of a self-organized polystyrene sphere and subsequent etching of the IGZO\nchannel allowed a porous gate structure, which was used for the mask. The structure was treated with Ar plasma through a porous gate mask to increase the conductivity of the IGZO\nchannel layer. This NDD on the IGZO channel region rendered a high mobility of 79.0 cm2 Vs−1 in the resulting TFTs, which can be attributed to the NDD-induced barrier lowering effect on the percolation conduction mechanism.\n\nThe tailing states near conduction band minimum of IGZO are believed to originate mainly from atomic disordering. The excess oxygen or loosely bound oxygen species in the IGZO material can give rise to a substantial increase in the tailing state distribution. Zan et al reported an exceptionally high mobility of ∼100 cm2 Vs−1 in amorphous In1/3Ga1/3Zn1/3O TFTs by capping the Ca/Al layer with subsequent stabilization in air [74]. The strong reduction 30 (2015) 024002 J Yeon Kwon and J Kyeong Jeong power of the Ca film on the IGZO surface caused the elimination of interstitial oxygen defects in the IGZO channel, leading to a decrease in the tailing defect states. Interestingly, this high mobility in IGZO TFTs was achieved without compromising the SS factor or the Ion/off ratio. The device stored for 50 days in air exhibited a mobility of 105.7 cm2 Vs−1, SS factor of 0.12 V/decade and Ion/off ratio of 9 × 108, corresponding to the state-of-art characteristics in any TMO TFT (figure 11). Figure 12 shows the benchmark plot between the field-effect mobility and Ion/off ratio for various TMO TFTs. Because the values of the higher field-effect mobility would be compromised somewhat by the lower Ion/\noff ratios for various TMO TFTs, the regions of the TFTs satisfying the high mobility (>30 cm2 Vs−1) and Ion/off ratio\n(⩾108) are still limited.\n\nNote that some of the TMO TFTs referred in this section were not properly passivated. The adoption of a high quality passivation layer on the bare channel layer would further improve the PBS, NBS and NBIS stability of the resulting TMO TFTs [11, 75, 76].\n\n## 3.2. Bce Architecture For Low Fabrication Cost 8\n\nBottom gate and ES type TMO TFTs exhibited good uniformity and stability as well as reasonable field-effect mobility because the electrical degradation of the channel properties, which is caused by physical and/or chemical damage during patterning of the source/drain (S/D) data line, can be prevented by the existing ES layer beneath the S/D metal film. This ES\ntype device, however, has the drawback of relatively high processing cost and the difficulty in fabricating a short channel device. Compared to the BCE type structure, the ES type device requires additional deposition of an ES layer by PECVD\nas well as patterning by photo-mask lithography and etching.\n\nIn addition, the existence of an ES layer on TMO semiconductor layer limits the definition of a short channel device due to the misalignment margin of the gate-to-ES or the source/\ndrain-to-ES. The panel design with a bezel-free good form factor necessitates the addition of driver integration on the circuit peripheral region of the same panel, which requires the design of short channel (<2 μm) TFTs. For two main reasons, there is strong demand for BCE type TMO TFTs.\n\nThe S/D metal film on the channel layer should be overetched during the patterning process of the S/D electrode line.\n\nThe fabricated device showed simple conducting behavior because of the residual metallic components on the channel back surface. Dry etching or/and wet etching methods are used to pattern the S/D metal line. For a high-resolution AM display, dry etching would be preferred due to the ability of an anisotropic etching profile with good overlay accuracy.\n\nThe first BCE IGZO TFTs-driven four inch AMOLED panel was fabricated by dry etching of the Mo S/D film on the IGZO contact layer using fluorine-based plasma [77]. On the other hand, the effects of plasma-based dry etching on the degradation of the resulting BCE IGZO TFTs was not addressed in detail. Park et al reported the effects of a N2O\nplasma treatment and passivation layer on the device performance of the BCE IGZO TFTs [78]. The Mo S/D electrode\n\nSemicond. Sci. Technol. 30 (2015) 024002.\n\nJ Yeon Kwon and J Kyeong Jeong\n\n![9_image_0.png](9_image_0.png)\n\nwas patterned by dry etching using a SF 6 /O 2 gas mixture. The transfer characteristics of the BCE IGZO TFTs were adversely affected by etching-induced damage. The SS factor and I off value were degraded to 1.0 V/decade and 10- 11 A, respectively. This deterioration was attributed to the formation of oxygen loss and 3 nm thick in segregation, which might result from the selective removal of oxygen ions with the larger coordination number of the In cation. The device performance of the IGZO TFTs is also strongly dependent on the deposition conditions of the SiO 2 passivation layer. A\nhuge hydrogen concentration, originating from the SiH 4 precursor, can be incorporated into the PECVD-derived SiO 2 film. Because hydrogen often acts as a shallow donor center in IGZO films, the thermal diffusion of hydrogen to the IGZO\nchannel layer during post annealing results in metallic behavior of the resulting TFTs, as shown in figure 13 (a). The switching property of the TFTs was improved substantially by the post treatment of N 2 O plasma on the damaged channel surface, which supplied oxygen species near the IGZO back surface region and prevented the invasion of hydrogen from the SiO 2 passivation layer. Therefore, the N 2 O treated device decade and low I off of 10 − 13 A (figure 12 (b)). The switching property and BTS induced stability of dry etching-based BCE\nIGZO TFTs can be improved further by optimizing the N 2 O\nplasma treatment, deposition conditions and post annealing of the SiO 2 passivation layer [ 79 ].\n\nThe wet etching technique has the merits of low processing cost and relatively high throughput compared to dry etching. The selection and formulation of the wet etchant is of prime importance because ZnO-based oxide materials are etched too easily in weak acid. The effects of a HNO 3 -based etchant and H 2 O 2 -based etchant on the performance of the IGZO TFTs with a Mo S/D electrode were compared [ 80 ].\n\n![10_image_0.png](10_image_0.png)\n\n![10_image_1.png](10_image_1.png)\n\nThe BCE IGZO TFTs using the HNO 3 -based etchant showed an inferior SS factor (1.22 V/decade) and more negative V th value (1.8 V), indicating the formation of substantial etchinginduced trap states near the IGZO back surface. From the O1s XP spectra, the oxygen-deficient region on the IGZO back surface was confirmed to have been created, which can be attributed to the surface reaction of IGZO films with a strong reducing agent containing H + ions (pH < 1). In contrast, the H 2 O 2 -based etchant-patterned BCE IGZO device exhibited better switching characteristics: reasonable mobility of 13 cm 2 Vs − 1 , lower SS value of 0.74 V/decade and higher V th of 2.6 V. The comparable performance using the H 2 O 2 -based etchant was previously reported for BCE IZO TFTs [ 81 ].\n\nTherefore, the use of a H 2 O 2 -based etchant for patterning the S/D line in the BCE TMO TFTs would be a better choice than that of the HNO 3 -based etchant.\n\nRecently, wet etching using a H 2 O 2 -based etchant and subsequent SF 6 plasma treatment to remove the wet-etching residues was attempted for BCE IZO TFTs with the Mo S/D electrode. The resulting BCE-type IZO TFTs exhibited stable behavior against external BTS applications: the V th shift was only 0.25 and −0.2 V under PBS and NBS conditions\n(V GS =±30 V, V DS =0 V  @60 C, 12 h), respectively [ 82 , 83 ].\n\nAlthough the TMO TFTs with Mo film as the S/D\nelectrode have been studied intensively, there are a paucity of reports regarding the BCE processing for the Cu-contacted TMO TFTs. This needs to be investigated in the near future.\n\nFurthermore, the photo-bias instability of Cu contacted BCE\nTMO TFTs should be compared with its ES TMO TFT\ncounterpart [ 84 ]. A future study should examine whether the reliability of BCE type TMO TFTs can be comparable to that of ES type TMO TFTs. Because TMO materials are vulnerable to various wet etchants and solvents as well as to ionic bombardment under a plasma ambient, the in-depth degradation chemistry of the underlying TMO materials during S/D\npatterning needs to be understood clearly. Obviously, the stoichiometry deviation and unwanted impurities near the back surface of the TMO films should be either eliminated or inactivated by developing novel post treatments or processing prior to the formation of a passivation layer, which would allow the ES type compatible reliability of the resulting ES\ntype TMO TFTs.\n\n## 3.3. Self-Aligned Coplanar Architecture\n\nFigure 14 (a) shows the equivalent unit pixel circuit for AMLCD.  When the scan signal switches from the turn-on state to the turn-off state, the pixel suffers from a certain voltage drop ( ΔV P ) due to capacitive coupling caused by the parasitic gate-to-source capacitance ( CGS ) (figure 14 (b)). The\n\n![11_image_0.png](11_image_0.png)\n\n![11_image_1.png](11_image_1.png)\n\n$$\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{P}}={\\frac{C_{\\mathrm{GS}}}{C_{\\mathrm{LC}}+C_{\\mathrm{SC}}+C_{\\mathrm{GS}}}}\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{G}},$$\n\nwhere C LC is the capacitance of the liquid crystal, C SC is the capacitance of the storage capacitor and ∆ V G is the voltage swing of the scanning line. The imbalance in V P with frame inversion driving gives rise to flicker or image sticking, which is called the 'kickback effect' [ 85 ]. The kickback effect induces a similar image sticking problem in the panel driving of AMOLEDs. To reduce the kickback effect, the storage capacitance in one pixel should be increased. On the other hand, the higher resolution design renders a smaller unit pixel area, which limits the maximum storage capacitance.\n\nThe best way to eliminate the kickback effect is to adopt a self-aligned coplanar architecture. Although many studies of the staggered or inverted staggered structures of TMO TFTs have been reported, there are only a few reports of TMO\nTFTs with a self-aligned coplanar device. Morosawa et al reported the fabrication of IGZO TFTs with a self-aligned coplanar device for the first time [ 86 ]. Figure 2 (c) shows a schematic cross-section of a self-aligned coplanar TFT. In terms of device operation, the modulation of the gate fieldinduced conductance in metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) capacitors is similar to that of the bottom gate configurations, such as BCE and ES structure. On the other hand, the charge carrier injection from the source to channel layer is limited due to a lack of overlap of the gate electrode and source electrode. Therefore, a key process in the self-aligned structure is to form a metal access layer, which is denoted by the pink color in figure 2 (c). Although selective ion doping via the gate electrode and subsequent activation process are well established for coplanar LPTS TFTs, ion doping is unavailable for TMO TFTs. The authors introduced a metal reaction method to form a metallic IGZO access region (figure 15 ).\n\nThe underlying mechanism is based on the thermodynamic equilibrium reaction between the capping metal layer and underlying IGZO layer. Two types of 5 nm thick capping layers, such as Ti and Al, were deposited by dc magnetron sputtering after patterning the gate line (see figure 15 (b)).\n\nSubsequent thermal annealing in oxygen ambient at 300 °C\ncaused the conversion from a metallic Al (Ti) film to an Al 2 O 3 (TiO 2 ) film. During the metal reaction, the formation of Al 2 O 3 near the Al/IGZO interface consumed the oxygen species from the back surface IGZO film, which gives rise to the creation of metallic IGZO due to an oxygen deficiency.\n\nThe resulting self-aligned coplanar IGZO TFTs with a Mo/Al/ IGZO contact stack exhibited a high mobility of 21.4 cm 2 Vs − 1 and a low contact resistance ( R C ) of 2 Ω cm, indicating good ohmic contact. The R C value of 2 Ω cm was much smaller than those (20 ~ 100 Ω cm) reported for the bottom gate IGZO TFTs [ 87 , 88 ].\n\n111\n\n 30 (2015) 024002 J Yeon Kwon and J Kyeong Jeong\n\n![12_image_0.png](12_image_0.png)\n\nHydrogen doping of the TMO layer can be used to form a metallic access layer. SiO2 or SiNx containing a large concentration of hydrogen species was deposited after patterning the gate bus line. During post deposition annealing, hydrogen diffuses in the S/D contact region of the IGZO layer, where the hydrogen incorporated in IGZO acts as a shallow donor.\n\nTherefore, the S/D contact region of IGZO converts to the metallic state, leading to ohmic contact between IGZO and the S/D electrode [89, 90]. The switching speed of the inverters based on the self-aligned coplanar a-IGZO TFTs was quite high (∼1.25 MHz), which was attributed to the small parasitic capacitance and high mobility of 23.3 cm2 Vs−1 [90]. Finally, a plasma treatment, such as Ar, NH3 etc, can be used for the formation of a metallic access region. As mentioned earlier, energetic ion bombardment, such as Ar radicals during plasma treatment, causes an oxygen-deficient region near the back channel surface of the TMO film, which results in a metallic region, presumably due to VO-induced free electron generation [91].\n\nSelf-aligned coplanar TFTs with a channel layer of a-IZO\nelectrode instead of a-IGZO was reported to have a high mobility of 157 cm2 Vs−1, low SS factor of 0.19 V/decade and good electrical reliability (figure 16) [92]. The N2O plasma treatment facilitated a transition from the conducting IZO film to a semiconducting IZO due to the elimination of oxygen vacancies near the IZO back surface. Ohmic contact between the Mo S/D electrode and IZO channel layer was achieved by an Ar plasma treatment on the S/D contact region of the IZO\nfilm. Remarkably, the Vth shift of the fabricated self-aligned device was ∼0 and 1.0 V under severe NBIS and PBIS conditions (∼3000 cd m−2, VGS,ST = ±20 V, VDS,ST = 10 V @\n60 °C, 11 000 s), respectively.\n\nThe first self-aligned coplanar IGZO-driven AMOLED\npanel was demonstrated by Sony Inc., where a metallic access region was formed using an Al metal reaction method.\n\n(figure 17(a)) [86]. The 9.9 inch quarter high definition\n(960 × 540) AMOLED panel exhibited a brightness of 200 cd m−2, a contrast ratio of 1 000 000:1 and a color gamut of 96%. In 2013, Bae and coworkers from LG display Inc.\n\ndemonstrated a prototype of a 13.1 inch AMOLED panel that was driven by self-aligned coplanar IGZO TFTs\n(figure 17(b)). Metallic IGZO was formed by an Ar plasma treatment. The mobility, SS and Vth values of the IGZO TFTs obtained in the OLED panel were 11.1 cm2 Vs−1, 0.12 V/\ndecade and 0.92 V, respectively [93].\n\n## 3.4. Cu Process For Low Resistance S/D Data Line\n\nThe charging error in the storage capacitor of each pixel during the selection time increased with increasing resolution, frame rate and panel size, which gives rise to the shading effect and image distortion in the resulting display. To reduce this RC delay, the development of the gate and S/D interconnection process with a low resistivity as well as high mobility TFTs is essential. In this regard, the Cu metallization process in conjunction with the IGZO or non-IGZO semiconductor has been studied. In the case of the Cu gate line, the transitional process consisting of a Cu film, adhesion and/or diffusion barrier can be adopted in a straightforward manner because the Cu gate process is well proven in a-Si and LPTS\ntechnology. On the other hand, the application of a Cu film as the S/D data line satisfies the following requirements including good adhesion, excellent diffusion barrier properties and low ohmic contact between the TMO channel and Cu film.\n\nThe directly contacted device between the Cu electrode and IGZO channel suffers from the well-known Cu diffusion problem during elevated thermal annealing [94]. The humplike behavior in the transfer characteristics of the Cu TFTs became dominant with increasing VDS, which is believed to have originated from the electro-migration of Cu impurities along the channel length direction. The Cu impurity in the IGZO channel causes the creation of tailing trap states and deep states. From a comparative study of IGZO TFTs with an Al, Mo and Cu S/D electrode, the Cu contacted TFTs exhibited an inferior SS factor (∼1.0 V/decade) to those\n(∼0.5 V/decade) of Al or Mo contacted TFTs [95]. This can be explained by the inter-diffusion of Cu impurities into the IGZO channel region, which was confirmed by TOF-SIMS\nanalysis. Therefore, the common feature of Cu-contaminated TFTs was the phenomena of severe stretch-out in the subthreshold drain current due to the additional creation of Cu-related tailing states and deep states in the IGZO channel region [96]. Therefore, the diffusion barrier to prevent\n\n 30 (2015) 024002 J Yeon Kwon and J Kyeong Jeong\n\n![13_image_2.png](13_image_2.png)\n\n![13_image_0.png](13_image_0.png)\n\n![13_image_1.png](13_image_1.png)\n\n10.1 V 10.1 V\n-10 -5 0 5 10 -10 -5 0 5 10 Gate voltage (V)-10 5 -5 0 10 Mob (cm2/Vs)Mob (cm2 /Vs) 180\n\n## 4. Conclusions\n\nCu diffusion should be inserted between the Cu electrode and TMO channel layer.\n\nRefractory metals, such as Ti, Mo, Cr, Ta or Mo-Ti alloy, can be used as a potential diffusion barrier and adhesion promoter for Cu-contacted TMO TFTs [97]. For example, the introduction of a Ta-diffusion barrier between the Cu electrode and ZTO channel layer can suppress the inter-diffusion of Cu impurities into the channel region during thermal annealing. The resulting Ta-inserted ZTO TFTs showed better switching properties than that of the Cu TFTs without a diffusion barrier: the mobility and SS factor were improved from 13.2 cm2 Vs−1 and 1.1 V/decade (control device) to 18.7 cm2 Vs−1 and 0.48 V/decade, respectively [98]. Yun and Koike reported the fabrication of IGZO TFTs with a Cu–Mn alloy as the S/D electrode [99]. The good ohmic contact\n(1.2 × 10−4 Ωcm2) between the Cu–Mn and IGZO film after annealing at 250 °C for 1 h was attributed to the formation of a metallic IGZO layer with a Ne of 1.4 × 1020 cm−3, which allowed reasonable performance of the IGZO TFTs with the Cu–Mn S/D electrode: the mobility, SS and Vth were 10.8 cm2 Vs−1, 0.44 V/decade and 5.5 V, respectively.\n\nThe Ti/Si stack barrier for the S/D Cu interconnection was examined. The good diffusion barrier properties and the contact resistance between IGZO and Cu metal resulted in reasonable performance of the resulting IGZO TFTs [100].\n\n13 Vacuum-based n-type TMO TFTs have begun to penetrate as the backplane technology in commercial flat panel displays, such as AMLCD and AMOLED displays owing to their superior device properties and low fabrication cost, which is comparable to those of their silicon-based counterparts. To accelerate the implementation of TMO TFTs, a high mobility\n(>30 cm2 Vs−1) and low parasitic capacitance device architecture should be developed to compete with LPTS TFTs.\n\nRecently, various channel compositions, double channels or composite structures as approaches to achieving high mobility have been proposed. These approaches showed LPTS-compatible high mobility. On the other hand, the electrical reliability including the PBS, NBS, NBIS and hot carrier effect etc are not completely understood, which should be addressed in the near future. In terms of the device architecture, the current ES type bottom gate TMO TFTs is expected to be replaced by the BCE-type bottom gate and/or the self-aligned coplanar structure with a Cu interconnection because these structures have the merit of low cost fabrication, short channel device and low parasitic capacitance. Because the TMO composition and structure for high mobility (>30 cm2 Vs−1) should be compatible with advanced architectures, the issues related to the unit process and device integration for this purpose will become a major research topic.\n\n 30 (2015) 024002 J Yeon Kwon and J Kyeong Jeong\n\n![14_image_0.png](14_image_0.png)\n\nFigure 17.

The ALD process offers accurate controlling of film thickness and composition as well as ability of achieving excellent uniformity over large areas at relatively low temperatures. First, an introduction is provided on what is the definition of ALD, the difference among other vacuum deposition techniques, and the brief key factors of ALD on flexible devices. Second, considering functional layers in flexible oxide TFT, the ALD process on polymer substrates may improve device performances such as mobility and stability, adopting as buffer layers over the polymer substrate, gate insulators, and active layers. Third, this review consists of the evaluation methods of flexible oxide TFTs under various mechanical stress conditions. The bending radius and repetition cycles are mostly considering for conventional flexible devices. It summarizes how the device has been degraded/changed under various stress types (directions). The last part of this review suggests a potential of each ALD film, including the releasing stress, the optimization of TFT\nstructure, and the enhancement of device performance.

Introduction\n\nIn modern era, the display technology has been rapidly advanced that peoples' lives are getting into the swing of commercial products from small/medium mobiles device to large TVs.  Display  market  have  been  faced  to  significant  factors like higher resolution, lighter weight, lower power consumption, thinner thickness, and a free designing-form. Especially, the customers have demanded that the next generation of innovation could be flexible paper-thin display, which is available to fold or roll from large screen size to small form factor in the coming display market[1]. Besides, the flexible activematrix  organic  light-emitting  diode  (AMOLED)  displays exhibit  suitable  characteristics  for  mobile  terminals  or  large sheet-shaped  televisions  (TVs),  attribute  to  its  lightweight, thin  thickness,  mechanically  robust  and  high  quality  images[2].  Afterwards,  regarding  a  display  operation,  many  researchers  have  paid  attentions  on  flexible  TFT  fabrication processes,  that  limited  by  process  temperature  due  to  polymer substrates[3]. In addition, the device performances on flexible  substrates  should  be  considered  such  as  high  mobility and  on-off  current  modulation,  low  contact  resistance  and mechanical flexibility in the meantime[4, 5].\n\nAmorphous silicon (a-Si) TFTs and polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) TFTs have been mostly produced for commercial  display  devices[6, 7],  while  numerous  organic  and  inorganic  materials  had  also  been  extensively  explored  to  replace  the  silicon  semiconductors[8, 9].  Among  various  semiconductor TFTs, a-Si and organic TFT exhibited a low mobility  (<  1  cm2/(V·s))  and  inferior  bias  stability[5, 10–12].  Although  poly-Si  TFTs  showed  outstanding  high  mobility\n(> 80 cm2/(V·s)) and excellent stability, its process is limited due to high process temperature budget (> 450 °C) as well as expensive laser crystallization system[13, 14]. As a result, oxide semiconductor TFTs have recently been considered as alternative  solutions  due  to  their  high  mobility  and  low  process temperature, relative low cost and good transparency in visible light region[15]. Among oxide semiconductor, amorphous indium–gallium–zinc oxide (a-InGaZnO) is well known as a potential material for high stability and low off current[16, 17].\n\nAs relative low mobility (~10 cm2/(V·s)) limits various application of a-IGZO TFTs, researches started to focus on the high performance of oxide semiconductor TFTs through methods of element doping, crystallization and multi-channel layer[18–20].\n\nVery recently, many flexible TFTs have been fabricated on  polyimide  (PI)  or  PEN  (polyethylene  naphthalate)  films, which  usually  covered  with  functional  buffer  layers  due  to anti-water diffusion and smooth surface morphology development[21]. The characteristics of buffer layer, normally deposited by ALD or chemical vapor deposition (CVD), would probably influence the electrical performance of TFTs, regarding the mobility and stability[22]. Moreover, many studies on flex-\n\n  \n\n| Table 1.                 | Summary of recent reports for ALD buffer layer based flexible oxide TFTs.   |           |              |          |                   |               |      |\n|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|--------------|----------|-------------------|---------------|------|\n| Substrate                | Buffer layer                                                                | Method    | Active layer | Mobility | Strain/radius     | Bending cycle | Ref. |\n| PI                       | SiOx , SiNx /Al2O3                                                          | PECVD/ALD | IGZO         | 14.88    | 15 mm             | 10000         | [22] |\n| Polyethylene naphthalate | Organic/Al2O3                                                               | ALD       | IGZO         | 15.5     | 3.3 mm            | 10000         | [43] |\n| PI                       | SiNx /SiO2 /Al2O3                                                           | ALD       | InOx         | 15       | 5 mm (0.4% tens.) | 10000         | [44] |\n| PI                       | Al2O3                                                                       | ALD       | a-IGZO       | 12.5     | 2 mm              | [45]          |      |\n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)\n\nible oxide TFTs have been reported for the optimized channel layer and gate insulators[23, 24]. Channel layers for enhancing mobility and stability of oxide TFTs, have been investigated on various deposition methods to keep lower process temperature and higher stability under mechanical stress[25, 26]. In terms of gate insulators in the TFTs, the conventional insulator  materials,  such  as  SiO2 and  Si3N4 deposited  by  CVD,\nshowed high process temperature (> 300 °C), which is limiting to select polymer substrate. The  ALD  is  a  conventional  thin  film  deposition  technique,  based  on  self-limited  surface  reaction,  to  dose  in  the chamber with two or more separated gaseous reactant pulses.\n\nFig. 1 shows that the ALD growth process consists of alternating pulses of gaseous chemical precursors that react with the substrate,  which  were  called  \"half-reactions\".  During  each half-reaction, the precursor that pulsed into chamber with certain time fully reacts with substrate surface. Then, there will be no more than one monolayer at the reaction surface due to the  self-limiting  process.  Subsequently,  inert  carrier  gas  is purged into chamber to remove by-products. The process of cycling  half-reactions  by  pulse  and  purge  then  forms  layers of the desired material[27]. Thus, ALD is appropriate for the precise control of film thickness and composition, while achieving uniform step coverages at relatively low temperatures[28].\n\nThus, ALD techniques can grow oxide semiconductors, dielectrics  or  relative  hydride  gate  insulator  layers  for  applying TFT fabrications[29–31].\n\nThis review article focuses on the ALD materials and processes in flexible oxide semiconductor TFT, including the buffer, gate insulator and oxide semiconductor layers. Also, it consists of the mechanical evaluation methods on flexible TFTs, including various bending conditions and device degradation mechanisms.  This  review  introduces  proper  solutions  using functional ALD layers to solve critical issues of flexible oxide semiconductor TFTs.\n\n## 2. Functional Ald Layers For Flexible Oxide Tfts 2.1. Ald Buffer Layer\n\nConventional buffer layer fabrication process on glass substrate is losing its attentions due to high water-vapor transmission rate (WVTR) of carrier glass that possesses weak ability of  blocking  water  molecules  from  the  ambient  permeating though  the  flexible  plastic  substrate[32–34].  Recent  reports about  ALD  buffer  layer  are  summarized  in Table  1,  SiO2, SiNx and Al2O3 are commonly used for buffer layers on flexible substrate[22, 35–38], where SiO2 and SiNx buffer layers are fabricated  by  plasma  enhanced  chemical  vapor  deposition\n(PECVD) process and Al2O3 buffer layer is mostly deposited by ALD. Compared to ALD deposited Al2O3\n[39, 40], PECVD\nproduced SiO2 and SiNx, although widely used in a-Si TFTs, were reported containing extremely high hydrogen (H2) concentration  (~25%)[41, 42] and  hydrogen  diffusion  that  would probably degrade TFT performance. Besides, it was reported that utilizing an organic/inorganic ALD buffer layer can improve  flexibility  of  TFT  under  mechanical  strain,  which proved that the TFTs would not degraded even under the mechanical bending situation at a curvature radius of 3.3 mm and after the repetitive bending cycles[43].\n\n## 2.1.1. Single Buffer Layer\n\nIt was reported reactant species could influence the barrier  characteristics  for  ALD  Al2O3 buffer,  including  WVTR\nand H2 passivation[46]. AsFig. 2(a)shows, top gate bottom contact  In–Ga−Zn−O  (IGZO)  TFT  was  fabricated  on  PI  substrate covered with SiNx/Al2O3 buffer layer, while Al2O3 was deposited  by  ALD  using  water  or  ozone  reactant.  The source/drain (S/D) electrodes and active are formed by depositing indium-tin oxide (ITO) and IGZO by sputtering and patterned by wet etch. The transfer curves exhibit in Figs. 2(b)\nand 2(c) shows stability performance of devices where TFT\nwith  Al2O3 buffer  using  ozone  as  reactant  exhibited  lower field-effect  mobility  (4.73  cm2/(V·s))  and  poor  stability\n( Vth =  −5.32  V)  under  negative  bias  temperature  stress\n(NBTS) (VG = −20 V, temperature = 60 °C and time = 3000 s in air) than using water as reactant (mobility of 7.15 cm2/(V·s)\nand Vth = −0.64 V). The device with Al2O3(ozone) exhibits much more seriously degradation under air ambient than in vacuum that reveals barrier characteristics of ambient molecules would probably be the reason of transfer characteristics degradation under bias and temperature stress.\n\n∆\n∆\n\n![3_image_0.png](3_image_0.png)\n\nFurther thin film analyses were produced to investigate the  mechanism  of  different  TFTs  degradation  for  different ALD  processed  buffers.  The  result  of  X-ray  reflectivity\n(XRR) indicated Al2O3(H2O) buffer had higher film density\n(3.14 g/cm3) and much smoother surface (0.49 nm) comparing to Al2O3(ozone) (2.97 g/cm3 and 1.04 nm). Based on the density of state (DOS) analysis (shown in Fig. 2(d)), higher density state existed in Al2O3(ozone) buffer both in vacuum and air ambient comparing to Al2O3(H2O), the authors suggested that relative low film density of Al2O3(ozone) resulted in facility of ambient molecules penetrating, and rough surface contributed to the poor-transfer performance where rough interfaces would act as charge trap site. Thus, the characteristics of  effective  passivation  or  external  ambient  eliminating  of ALD buffer layer was affected by ALD reactant, playing essential  role  to  reduce  the  defect  state  and  then,  the  stability  of TFT operation.\n\n## 2.1.2. Hybrid Buffer Layer\n\nThe flexible a-IGZO TFT fabricated on polyimide substrate with stack structure or organic/inorganic hybrid structure were also reported for flexibility development[22, 43]. The structure of top-gate and bottom contact a-IGZO TFTs fabricated on PEN substrate was shown in Fig. 3(a) and corresponding  transfer  performances  with  different  buffer  layer  were demonstrated in Fig. 3(b). The buffer layers were designed as SiNx 50 nm (Device A), SiNx 50 nm/Al2O3 10nm (Device B)\nand SiNx 50 nm/Al2O3 100 nm (Device C), respectively. The organic barrier and inorganic Al2O3 barrier were prepared by spin-coating and ALD, respectively. And S/D electrode and active layer, ITO and IGZO, was deposited by sputtering and patterned by wet etch. Al2O3 was deposited by ALD as gate dielectric  and  patterned  by  wet  etch.  Finally,  gate  electrodes  and S/D pads were formed by deposition and patterning of Al by thermal evaporation. As device A exhibited quite poor transfer performance (not shown, saturation mobility 3.31 cm2/(V·s),\nthreshold  voltage  −23.93  V  and  sub-threshold  voltage  0.76 V/decade)  compared  to  other  devices,  it  was  supposed  that higher H2 concentration existed in SiNx buffer layer lead to degradation by H2 penetrates during the process of TFT fabrication. In terms of device B and C that with different thickness of Al2O3, the higher sub-threshold voltage (0.84 V/decade) of device B than device C (0.24 V/decade) indicated that critical thickness of Al2O3 was necessary for effective hydrogen passivation.\n\nAs flexibility of conventional ALD inorganic buffer materials  have  their  limitations  due  to  their  high  Young's moduli[47], organic materials, with much lower Young's modulus, started to be utilized for hybrid buffer layer owing to the difference in the modulus of elasticity between two kinds of materials[43].  The  a-IGZO  TFTs  with  top-gate  bottom-contact structure on the flexible polyethylene naphthalate (PEN)\nsubstrate is shown inFig. 3(c) where a 3 mm-thick organic barrier (spin-coating) and a 50 nm-thick inorganic Al2O3(ALD)\nbarrier  were  deposited  in  order  to  obtain  a  smooth  surface\n\n![4_image_0.png](4_image_0.png)\n\n| Table 2.       | Transfer performance parameters comparison for device with different buffer layers[43] .   |                       |                            |              |\n|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|--------------|\n| Device         | Mobility (cm2 /(V·s))                                                                      | Threshold voltage (V) | Subthreshold swing (V/dec) | On/off ratio |\n| No buffer      | 1.11                                                                                       | 9.4                   | 0.4                        | 3.1 × 107    |\n| Organic buffer | 14.4                                                                                       | 2.8                   | 0.4                        | 1.5 × 109    |\n| Hybrid buffer  | 15.5                                                                                       | 4.1                   | 0.2                        | 4.7 × 109    |\n\nand a low moisture permeability, and a protection against mechanical  damage.  To  compare  the  roles  of  each  barrier  layer, the performance of TFTs with no buffer, only with an organic  buffer  and  a  hybrid  organic/inorganic  buffer  were  researched. In terms of transfer performance (Table 2), the TFT\nwith  hybrid  barrier  exhibited  marked  improvements  attributed to both of surface smoothness and ambient impermeability. The mechanical bending performance also found flexible IGZO TFTs with the hybrid organic/inorganic buffer layer exhibited excellent stable device characteristics under a mechanical  stress  even  at  a  curvature  radius  of  3.3  mm  (shown  in Fig.  3(d))  or  after  10000  repetitive  bending  cycles  (5  mm).\n\nThus,  we  prefer  to  keep  looking  forward  to  the  further  research on the hybrid organic/inorganic ALD buffer layer optimized for flexible oxide TFTs.\n\n## 2.2. Hybrid Organic/Inorganic Gate Insulator Layer\n\nThe recent reports of ALD gate insulator based flexible oxide  TFTs  are  summarized  in Table  3.  For  the  realization  of mechanically flexible devices, the aforementioned mechanical neutral plane is researched, which places the active layer in the device at mechanical neutral plane to reduce the mechanical stress when the device is under strains[48]. However, conventional inorganic dielectric layers such as SiO2, Si3N4, are vulnerable  to  mechanical  stress  and  fail  easily  by  cracking  or delamination  during  repetitive  large  mechanical  deformation[49].\n\nLee *et al*. reported an ultrathin ALD Al2O3layer based organic (poly-4vinyl phenol (PVP))/inorganic hybrid gate dielectrics for flexibility improvement of IGZO TFT as shown in Fig. 4(a) where the thickness of ALD Al2O3 varies from 20 to  40  nm.  The  inverted-staggered  top-contact  IGZO  TFTs were fabricated on a 125 lm-thick PI film. Then, a PVP layer of  1  lm  was  spin  coated  on  the  PI  substrates  to  make  a smooth  surface.  A  Ni  gate  electrode  of  100  nm  was  deposited on the bare PVP layer by the e-beam evaporator system using a shadow mask. The PVP and Al2O3layers of different thicknesses were formed by spin coating and ALD at 200 ℃,\nrespectively.

The thicker Al2O3layer (40 nm) based TFT exhibited electrical performance degradation of IGZO TFT (Fig. 4(c)). The cross-sectional  image  of  TFT  with  a  hybrid  gate  dielectric after 105 bending cycles by SEM was added in Fig. 4(b). The device showed delamination at the interface between the IGZO layer and source/drain Al electrodes. It seems the delamination between the active layer and source/drain electrodes degraded the device characteristics\n\n## 2.3. Active Ald Layer\n\nIn terms of active layer deposition, the conventional sputter or solution based oxide TFTs, such as IGZO, commonly need process temperatures above 300 °C in order to realize sufficiently reliable oxide TFTs with superior electrical performance, which in the meantime, can degrade TFT performance\n\n![6_image_0.png](6_image_0.png)\n\n![6_image_1.png](6_image_1.png)\n\nresult from coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and temperature capability of plastic substrate[57]. Otherwise, the traditional  a-IGZO  TFTs  exhibited  insufficient  field-effect  mobility for  high-resolution  AMOLED  display  as  reported  around 10 cm2/(V·s), such as 7 cm2/(V·s) by Ok *et al.*[46], 10 cm2/(V·s) by Jeong *et al.*[45], 7 cm2/(V·s) by Bak *et al.*[58].\n\n## 2.3.1. Active Layer Structure For Oxide Tfts\n\nBased  on  the  growth  mechanism  of  ALD,  considering the  growth  of  high  quality  inorganic  films  at  temperatures that plastic substrates can withstand, ALD is at present most appropriate.\n\nAn amount of reports about oxide TFT based on ALD published recently, which showed comparable performance to sputter or solution methods, such as 20 cm2/(V·s) of ZnO TFT by Tsai *et al.*[59],  13.4  cm2/(V·s)  of  ZnHfO  TFT  by  H.  N.\n\nAlshareef *et al.*[60], 6 cm2/(V·s) of Al–Zn–O (AZO) TFT by Lee *et al.*[61],  and  so  on[62–64].  To  increase  performance  of TFT, some groups came up with method of post annealing, the mobility of devices increased to 21.3 cm2/(V·s) using O2 annealing  at  400  °C  by  David  Wei  Zhang *et al.*[65] and 30.2 cm2/(V·s) using O2 annealing at 350 °C by Cho *et al.*[66],\nand  so  on[67, 68].  Such  high  annealing  temperature  does  not meet the standard of low process temperature requirement for flexible TFTs, which would possibly play an essential role of next generation display.\n\nBased  on  the  advancement  of  ALD,  active  layer  structure promotion was reported by some groups. The homogeneous  laminated  active  layer  was  most  widely  researched, where  concept  of  super-cycle  was  introduced.  Each  supercycle consists of several sub-cycles for each element (shown in Fig.  5(a)),  for  example,  the  IZO  active  layer  was  deposited by IZO super-cycles, containing one ZnO cycle and one In2O3 cycle reported as Park *et al.*'s paper[53]. Thus, the composition of deposited thin film can be effectively adjusted by the number of sub-cycles, which contributed to mobility optimization. On the other side, ALD process is a more appropriate approach for fabricating bi-layer channel structures that include quite thin front channel layer, commonly thinner than 5 nm, compared to the sputtering. The bi-layer channel structure owns superior TFT mobility and stability than single channel due to charge trap density and carrier concentrations control for both of front and back channel[69, 70].\n\nAsFig. 5(b)shows, ZnO-based bi-layer channel TFTs consisting  of  ZnO  and  AZO  layers  with  different  Al  compositions  and  stacking  sequences.  The  30  nm  ZnO  single-layer and  5  nm  AZO  (5  or  14  at.%  Al)/25  nm  ZnO  and  25  nm\n\n![7_image_0.png](7_image_0.png)\n\nZnO/5 nm AZO (5 or 14 at.% Al) bilayer channel structures were deposited on SiO2(200 nm)/p+-Si substrates by ALD at 200 °C. The thickness of the AZO layers was fixed at 5 nm, and the total thickness of the bi-layer channel was 30 nm. For the  bottom-gate  TFT  structure,  all  the  bi-layers  were  patterned  by  a  conventional  photolithography  process  and  wet etching. The source and drain electrodes were defined by depositing Ti (30 nm)/Au (70 nm) by e-beam evaporation using  a  shadow  mask.  The  width  and  length  of  the  channels were fixed at 500 and 50 μm, respectively. The ZnO single-layer and ZnO-based bi-layer channel TFTs were annealed in a furnace at 250 °C for 2 h under O2 ambient to reduce the carrier density of the channel layer and the contact resistance. The use of AZO thin layers as front channel reduced the charge trap  density  at  the  gate  dielectric/channel  interface  and  the back-channel effect on the channel surface, resulting in more stable TFTs under a gate bias stress. In addition, by control the composition of Al, the crystallization, which can affect mobility and stability, was adjusted by ALD process[64]. Similar approach  for  TFT  performance  by  ALD  was  reported  as shown  in Fig.  5(c),  where  step-composition  gradient  channels in oxide based TFTs was deposited and its effects on the performances and electrical stability of the TFT devices was investigated[63]. By utilizing ALD, the Al step-composition gradient channel could form alignment of conduction band offset within the channel layers for higher mobility as well as stability.\n\n## 2.3.2. Optimizing Materials/Processes For Flexible Oxide Tfts\n\nPrevious researches of ALD flexible TFT reveal its potential  for  applying  into  flexible  display  technology.  However, the relative high post treatment temperature still limits the application for flexible applications. Some groups started to focused on indium oxide based TFTs, which is known as a material to achieve high electron mobility due to single free electron-like band of In 5s states in the cubic bixbyite structure in linear  conducting  chains  of  edge-sharing  octahedral[71–73].\n\nHowever, as-deposited InOx generally exhibits metal-like conduction, in order to successfully implement this material as a semiconductor,  the  total  carrier  concentration  must  be  reduced to convey switching properties to the fabricated TFTs, which  could  be  controlled  available  by  post  treatment  as Fig.  6(a) shows[54].  The  performance  of  ALD  indium  oxide TFT was affected in terms of N2O plasma treatment time. By increasing N2O plasma treatment from 600 to 2400 s, the indium oxide positive shifted and mobility decreased, which can be explained by oxidation at surface of active layer. The suffering of plasma treatment at indium oxide channel induced oxygen deficiency decreasing and carrier concentration dropping when N2O plasma treatment time increasing. Fig. 6(b) shows bottom gate top contact thin film transistors (TFTs) based on IZO channels were fabricated on polyimide (PI) substrate by atomic layer deposition (ALD) at different growth temperature. The effect and its mechanism of growth temperature of IZO channel layer was found that IZO channel layer grow at increased temperature till 200 °C, exhibited best transfer and stability  performance  (saturation  mobility  42.3  cm2/(V·s),\nthreshold  voltage  0.7  V,  sub-threshold  voltage  0.29  V/decade and hysteresis 0.21 V) comparing to 150 and 175 °C due to  highest  carrier  concentration  with  increased  oxygen  vacancy and decreased electron trap states[54].\n\n## 3. Mechanical Stress Evaluation On Flexible Oxide Tfts\n\nAs  flexible  devices  were  sensitive  under  mechanical stress  due  to  dimensional  shape  transformation,  researchers  started  to  pay  attention  on  the  effects  of  mechanical stress[22, 45, 49, 54, 60, 65, 74–81]. It was reported performance of flexible oxide TFTs would be degraded under critical strain, repetitive  bending  cycles  or  different  bending  direction[45, 49, 54, 65, 77–80].\n\n## 3.1.

The decrease in the threshold voltage for tensile bending can be explained  by  two  reasons  as  reported  in  previous  papers[54, 80, 82–85].  One  is  the  increase  in  the  distance  between  the  atom that cause an effective decrease in the energy level splitting ( E)  of  the  bonding  and  anti-bonding  orbitals  between  the atoms in the semiconducting layer[86]. This changes the value of the Fermi function (more electrons are excited to the antibonding  state  for  the  semiconductor,  causing  an  increase  in the channel conductivity under tensile bending strain). The additional electrons caused an increase in the channel conductivity and, therefore, a negative shift of Vth. The other reason is reported previously that the charge transport of oxide semiconductors is related to the generation of carriers caused by native  defects  such  as  oxygen  vacancies  during  process[87, 88].\n\nThus the applied tensile strain might affect the oxygen vacancies,  which  could  change  the  electron  concentration  under mechanical deformation. The decrease of saturation mobility is due to the larger spacing between molecules is caused by tensile strain[31]. On the other side, the generation of defects in the interface of gate insulator and channel is revealed by slightly  increase  of  subthreshold  slop.  Besides,  the  increase\n∆\nof hysteresis also can be explained as the result from generation of charge traps by defects caused by tensile stress.\n\nThe transfer performances of ALD IZO TFT on PI substrates was also evaluated under repetitive bending with various strains, parameter change (shown in Fig. 7(b)). The measurements were produced after 100, 300, 1000, 2000 and 5000 bending cycles. Here the bending radius was adjusted from 5, 2,  and  1.5  nm,  while  the  calculated  strain  of  0.34%,  0.57%\nand 1.12% was induced. The Vth shifts in the negative direction  and  the  saturation  mobility  decreases  as  the  number  of bending cycles increases. It is generally reported in the literature that the degradation of electrical characteristics for amorphous oxide semiconductor is not significant when subjected to mechanical strain (under 1%), owing to their amorphous microstructure. Thus, for TFT bended smaller than 1% stress strain till 5000 repetitive cycles, a slight shift in Vth towards negative  values  (from  −2.3  to  −4.3  V)  is  observed.  As  the  TFTs bended  repeatedly  under  tensile  strain,  the  number  of  electrons that excited to the anti-bonding state increased, and resulted  in  carrier  concentration  increasing  in  the  semicondu ctor[86].  An  alternative  effect  would  involve  the  presence  of electron-donating  oxygen  vacancies,  of  which  the  density may increase with the application of tensile stress[87–89]. The\n\n![9_image_0.png](9_image_0.png)\n\nslight  decrease  in  field  effect  mobility  may  be  attributed  to the  increased  interatomic  spacing  in  the  semiconductor  induced  by  the  tensile  strain[31].  However,  when  the  stress strain was as large as 1.12%, the TFT lost its transfer characteristics  at  5000  cycles  and  showed  serious  degradation  compared  to  stress  strain  of  0.34%,  0.57%.  This  phenomenon may result from the electron trap sites and micro-cracks formation during repeated cycles under large bending strain.\n\n## 3.2. Tensile/Compressive & Parallel/Vertical Strains\n\nThe performance degradation of flexible TFTs under mechanical stress is also influenced by bending directions. Fig. 8\n(a) shows a-IGZO flexible TFT parameters shift under different types of stress (tensile/compressive) on the 50 μm PI substrate[79]. For the tensile stress, as bending radius decreased, threshold  voltage  negative  shift  and  saturation  mobility  decreased. On the other hand, for the compressive stress, the variation tendencies of TFT parameter are opposite. These phenomena reveal that energy level splitting in the internal semiconductor  materials  induced  by  change  of  atomic  bonding  distance[90] and resulted in TFT parameter change by changing Fermi-level energy level. On the other hands, comparison of parallel/vertical  stress  to  the  current  path  in  TFTs  is  under growing  concern[54, 91].  As  shown  in Fig.  8(b),  the  repeated mechanical bending stress was applied vertical or parallel to the  ALD  InOx TFTs[54].  The  mobility  decreases  gradually while S.S. value undergoes relatively minor change for vertical bending while TFT performance degradation is much more drastically for parallel bending. Similar report is published[91]\nrecently,  where  technology  computer  aided  design  simulation  was  performed  and  found  donor-like  and  acceptor-like states increase, respectively, by 2.5 × 1017 and 0.4 × 1017 cm−3 for vertical and parallel bending after 10000 bending.\n\n## 4. Conclusion\n\nIn this review, recent progresses of flexible oxide TFTs have been focused on various functional layers fabricated by ALD process, anticipating the improvement of device performances such as mobility, stability, and flexibility. The proper ALD buffer layer would provide excellent transfer performance  and  stable  reliability  for  flexible  oxide  TFTs.  In  addition,  inorganic/organic  ALD  based  gate  insulators  also  play an essential role as a mechanical neutral plane to strength the flexibility  of  oxide  semiconductor  TFTs.  Among  various ALD layers for flexible TFTs, the ALD oxide semiconductor act  as  an  important  role  for  operating  flexible  devices  with high mobility and stability, since the deposition method could easily control atomic compositions in nano-structure layer, unlike the sputtered oxide semiconductors. However, the mechanical  stresses  may  degrade  mobility  and  stability  of  oxide TFTs,  originated  from  the  micro-crack  generation.  Thus, ALD techniques could offer possible solutions regarding functional films, along with high quality, low deposition temperature, and less film-stress for applying flexible oxide semiconductor TFTs.\n\n## References\n\nKomatsu R, Nakazato R, Sasaki T, et al.

Besides the negative shift of threshold voltage (Vth),\nsimilar with that under DC SH stress, the asymmetric degradations near drain and source revealed the concomitant hot-carrier (HC) effect. The HC-induced local barrier near drain could compensate certain SH-induced Vth shift, while a drastic SH effect would in turn enhance the HC barrier to high enough to cause hard breakdown. For a-IGZO TFTs under dynamic SH stresses, the interactions between SH\nand HC effects dominate the degradation behaviors and can be sensitively tuned by the falling time of gate pulse, suggesting a feasible method of lessening the dynamic instability.\n\nIndex Terms**—Amorphous oxide semiconductor (AOS),**\nindium-gallium-zinc-oxide (IGZO), thin-film transistor (TFT),\nself-heating (SH), hot-carrier (HC), dynamic stress, instability, breakdown.\n\nI.

The representative amorphous indium-gallium-zinc oxide (a-IGZO) TFT has initiated the replacement of its silicon counterpart as the switch transistor in large-area and flexible displays. Further research efforts are devoted to exploring the current-driving capability of AOS TFTs for advanced applications, such as gate driver on array (GOA) [2], electroluminescence [3], and Micro-LED displays [4]. While AOS\nswitching TFTs could suffer the threshold voltage (Vth) shifts (-Vth) under various gate bias (VG) stresses, such as positive bias temperature stress (PBTS) and negative bias illumination stress (NBIS) [5], [6], even more severe deteriorations can be aroused when the large current flows through AOS TFTs under high VG and drain bias (VD).\n\nBesides the common -Vth, similar to PBTS and NBIS\ndegradations, diversified degradation behaviors have been caused by the high-current stresses under VG and VD, including the degradations of subthreshold slope (SS) [7] and mobility [8], abnormal hump [9], [10] and even normally-on channel [9], [10]. The hot-carrier (HC) effect [8], [11]–[15],\nself-heating (SH) effect [9], [10], [16]–[18], and their combinations [7], [19] have been accused, while the AOSs of poor thermal conductivities [20] are peculiarly prone to SH degradations. In order to more accurately evaluate the instability of current-driving AOS TFTs, dynamic SH stresses should be performed to mimic the practical operation conditions.\n\nIn this work, a-IGZO TFTs were subjected to pulsed VG and constant VD stresses. Besides the typical SH-induced negative -Vth, asymmetric degradation behaviors were extracted from source and drain, suggesting a concomitant HC effect. The interactions between HC and SH effects were revealed to determine the degradation behaviors of a-IGZO TFTs under dynamic SH stresses.\n\nII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nIn this work, the top-gate self-aligned a-IGZO TFTs were fabricated on glass substrates [21]. The active layer of 40-nm-thick a-IGZO and gate insulator (GI) of 200-nm-thick silicon oxide were respectively deposited by DC magnetron sputtering and plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). The n+-IGZO source/drain (S/D) regions were formed by argon (Ar) plasma bombardment [14]. 100-nm-thick molybdenum (Mo) was sputtered as gate and 0741-3106 © 2021 IEEE. Personal use is permitted, but republication/redistribution requires IEEE permission.\n\nSee https://www.ieee.org/publications/rights/index.html for more information.\n\n![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)\n\n200-nm PECVD silicon nitride deposited at 150 °C. The electrical characteristics of a-IGZO TFTs with channel width/length of 100 µ m/35 µ m were measured in the dark atmosphere using the Agilent B1500 semiconductor parameter analyzer. As illustrated in the inset of Fig. 1 , the a-IGZO TFTs were subjected to dynamic stresses of 40-V VD and unipolar VG pulse [22]. The parameters of VG pulse included pulse period and peak duration respectively of 10 µ s and 8 µ s, rising\n( t r ) and falling time ( t f ) both of 80 ns [23], base ( VG_base ) and peak voltage ( VG peak ) respectively of 0 V and 30 V.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 1 , after 200-s dynamic stress, the drain current ( ID ) versus VG curves exhibit negative shift with slight SS deterioration, opposite to the PBS-induced minor positive\n∆ V th [22] but similar to the typical degradation behavior under DC SH stress [18], [24]. During the VG_peak duration, the a-IGZO TFTs operated in the saturation regime with power around 12 mW, higher than the reported SH power of 6  mW [17], [18]. Due to the poor thermal conductivity of a-IGZO [20], surrounding silicon oxide and glass, the high-power stress gradually heated up a-IGZO TFTs, where an increased channel carrier concentration was often accused for the negative ∆ V th . These channel donors can originate from either the thermal diffusion of hydrogen or water molecules into the channel [9], [10], [18] or the heat-generated donor defects within a-IGZO [16], [19].\n\nThe pinched-off channel may suffer nonuniform degradation during the dynamic stress, thus the degradations of reverse-mode transfer curves were comparatively evaluated. As compared in the inset of Fig. 1 , after 200-s stress, the saturation-regime transfer curve measured at V D of 5.1 V\nexhibits less negative shift in the reverse mode than the forward I D -V G curve, suggesting asymmetric degradations near source and drain within the SH channel. During the saturationmode stress, the higher electric field near drain may cause additional HC effects, possibly forming a barrier region near drain side and thus elevating the local V th [11], [14], [15]. With such HC-induced higher- V th region depleted by the relatively high VD of 5.1 V, the forward ID-VG curve thus shifted more negatively than the reverse one. The linear-region transfer curves at V D = 0.1 V coincide in both forward and reverse modes, further verifying that HC effect only influences the local V th near drain rather than the whole channel.\n\nWhile the SH degradation occurred during the VG_peak duration, the HC effect may be more sensitive to the large change of electric field during tr and tf [23], [25]. In order to verify the role of HC in the dynamic SH degradation, the stress conditions were intentionally adjusted by comparatively varying t r or t f from 8 ns to 500 ns and meanwhile maintaining other parameters. For the same accumulated duration of V G_peak , dubbed the effective SH time ( t eff ), the t r - and t –induced degradation variations could be ascribed to the HC effect. As shown in Fig. 2 , the dynamic SH-induced ∆ V th gradually increases with t eff , suggesting the continuous generation of channel donors, while such teff evolutions of\n∆ V th exhibit distinctive dependence on tr and tr . For a constant tf of 50 ns, there is no noticeable correlation between ∆ Vth and t r . In contrast, much more negative ∆ V th was observed for a longer t f in Fig. 2 (b) . The underlying mechanism is then analyzed from the views of carriers and electric field.\n\nThe degradation mechanism of a-IGZO TFTs during tr and t  is comparatively illustrated in Fig. 3 . When V G ranges from 0 V to 30 V, the limited channel carrier concentration cannot trigger a large population of HCs, resulting in the weak dependence on tr observed in Fig. 2(a). When VG rapidly decreases from 30 V to 0 V, the channel is still populated with high-concentration electrons, so the significantly enhanced electric field near the drain side can accelerate partial electrons into HCs. While the HCs in silicon transistors include both hot electrons ( e − ) and hot holes ( h + ) [26], [27], those in Authorized licensed use limited to: Jinan University. Downloaded on June 05,2024 at 05:38:31 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply.\n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)\n\nAOS TFTs are mainly hot electrons. The HCs usually arise the charge trapping into GI or generate defects in semiconductor [11], [13]–[15].\n\nAs illustrated in Fig. 3(b), the strong electric field near drain rather than injects these hot e− into GI but drives them to collide with a-IGZO, dissociating some weak metal-oxygen bonds and thus proliferating defects and trap centers in bulk and/or at interface [8], [14]. A high energy barrier is thus formed near drain, increasing the local Vth and partially compensating the negative -Vth of SH main channel. When tf is prolonged from 8 ns to 500 ns, most VG_peak-induced electrons have enough time to be depleted before the elevation of electric field near drain, suppressing the HC effect and thus manifesting a larger negative -Vth. This agrees well with the stress-induced differences between forward- and reverse-mode transfer curves in Fig. 1, where a more negative Vth is extracted from the SH channel with the HC-induced higher-Vth region depleted by a large VD.\n\nAccording to the proposed role of HC in the dynamic SH\ndegradation, the HC-induced drain barrier should not only increase Vth, but also degrades SS, linear-region ON current (Ion) and saturation voltage. As shown in Fig. 4(a), the strong HC effect during 8-ns tf indeed gradually decreases the Ion, reducing the power and thus limiting the SH degradation. On the contrary, with the absence of HC effect during 500-ns tf, the SH effect continuously generated channel donors and gave rise to an increasing Ion.\n\nAccording to the SH mechanism, a further prolonged 500-ns-tf stress seems to be capable of forming a normally-on channel populated with massive donors, while Fig. 4(b) just points out the opposite. When teff increased to 1000 s, the ID\nexperienced a hard breakdown, together with slightly degraded gate leakage current (IG). In Fig. 4(c), the optical image from the bottom-side of failure TFT reveals two seriously damaged regions, the channel/drain interface along W (Region I) and central channel along L (Region II). The Region I clearly reveals asymmetric degradations near source and drain, and most plausibly corresponds to the channel breakage, while no differences can be observed between forward and reverse ID.\n\nThe gate-to-source capacitance (CGS) and gate-to-drain capacitance (CGD) were measured with floating drain and source, respectively. For breakdown a-IGZO TFTs, the drastic distinction between normally-off CGD–VG curve and the on-off characteristic of CGS further clarifies that the channel is only disconnected from drain rather than source, perfectly matching the visible breakage in Region I. The negative shift, gradual transition and large off-state of CGS–VG curve consolidate the SH-increased channel carrier concentration. However, these channel donors are no longer capable of elevating the ID\n(Fig. 4(a)), after the occurrence of Region-I breakdown cuts off the current path.\n\nAs illustrated in Fig. 3, the triggering of HC effect requires both high carrier concentration and strong electric field. When the Vth of gradually self-heated up channel shifts to a negative enough value, the channel carrier concentration becomes significantly high even at VG_base of 0 V. This, together with the high channel temperature [28], [29], triggers a much more drastic HC effect, resulting in the broken Region I to thoroughly disconnect channel from drain.\n\nThe severe HC damage might even extend into the central channel at the highest temperature due to poor thermal dissipation of a-IGZO [28], [29], consistent with the visible damage Region II of breakdown a-IGZO TFT. Besides, the minor drop of on-state CGS in Fig. 4(d) most plausibly suggests that the effective capacitance area is slightly reduced by such breakage Region II. When a-IGZO TFTs are subjected to dynamic SH stresses, either a relatively strong HC effect could constrain the weak SH effect, or the accumulated SH degradation would eventually cause the hard breakdown through triggering a drastic HC degradation.\n\nIII. CONCLUSION\nDynamic SH stresses were found to cause negative -Vth on a-IGZO TFTs, similar with the DC SH degradation caused by SH-generated channel donors, while the asymmetric -Vths extracted from forward- and reverse-mode ID suggest a concomitant HC effect. When HC effect is enhanced during a faster tf of gate pulse, the HC-induced drain barrier elevates the local Vth and thus partially compensates the SH-induced negative -Vth. Oppositely, an unstinted SH effect gradually increases the channel carriers and eventually explodes the HC barrier, triggering the drain breakdown. Such multiple roles of HCs complicate the dynamic SH degradations, and the HC-SH interactions could be elaborately adjusted to lessen the dynamic instability.\n\nREFERENCES\n[1] X. Xiao, L. Zhang, Y.

Hirschmana,b a **Department of Electrical and Microelectronic Engineering** \nb **Department of Microsystems Engineering,** \nRochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, New York, 14623, USA \nc **Corning Incorporated, Science & Technology Research,** \nCorning, New York, 14831, USA \nThis study investigates techniques to realize self-aligned IndiumGallium-Zinc Oxide (IGZO) TFTs that are not subject to gatesource/drain misalignment due to overlay error or process bias. The working source/drain electrodes in IGZO TFTs can be direct metal contact regions to the IGZO, however this typically requires several microns of gate overlap in order to provide ohmic behavior with minimal series resistance and ensure tolerance to overlay error. Boron ion implantation has been demonstrated to successfully dope IGZO, resulting in an estimated electron concentration level n ~ 1019 cm-3**. Top-gate co-planar TFTs were fabricated using boron** \nimplantation to selectively form IGZO:B n+ regions, with the channel region masked by the gate electrode. A novel lithographic strategy to extend this technique to the more traditional bottom-gate staggered TFT configuration has also been explored which utilizes top-side exposure rather than a back-side through-glass exposure, and would enable self-aligned devices on non-transparent substrates. Details of the self-aligned top-gate TFTs, and the topside exposure lithographic process will be presented. \n\n## Introduction\n\nSelf-aligned channel regions in thin-film transistors (TFTs) have advantages in reduced parasitic capacitance and stage delay, and a reduction in overhead real estate. A common method used to fabricate self-aligned a-Si:H TFTs is to utilize a through-glass exposure of photoresist which is blocked by the opaque metal bottom-gate electrode (1,2). This process does not require an additional photomask or lithographic alignment, and thus supports low production cost. Sputtered IGZO has been introduced into flat panel display product manufacturing, exhibiting a channel mobility of approximately an order of magnitude higher than a-Si:H. The working source/drain (S/D) electrodes in IGZO TFTs can be direct metal contact regions to the IGZO, without the need for additional processes such as doping to render the IGZO conductive. Proper metallurgy and annealing processes can provide ohmic behavior with minimal series resistance (3), however this usually requires several microns of gate-to-S/D overlap in order to ensure such behavior. Various self-aligned channel strategies have been demonstrated that either utilize a top-gate (TG) structure (4,5), or a through-glass exposure for bottom-gate (BG) configurations. The TG or associated BG feature must protect the channel region during S/D formation. \n\nTechniques that have been used to selectively form conductive IGZO regions include hydrogen diffusion (6), hydrogen plasma treatment (7-9), argon plasma treatment (10), and arsenic implantation (5). In this work the implantation of boron ions was used to form the n+ S/D regions on self-aligned TG (SA-TG) co-planar devices, resulting in ohmic contact behavior with TFT results showing DC operation comparable to metal-overlapped devices. \n\nIn order to enable self-aligned BG (SA-BG) staggered devices, a flood-exposure lithographic process is under development which utilizes the reflection from the underlying electrode, creating a mirror image of the gate electrode in positive photoresist above the IGZO channel region. This pattern definition, or extension thereof, can then be used to protect the channel region during subsequent S/D formation process. Experimental details and results from both of these new techniques to realize self-aligned device structures are described. \n\n## Experiment Sa-Tg Co-Planar Tft\n\nThe SA-TG process began with a thick isolation oxide (~500 nm SiO2**) thermally grown** \non a silicon wafer as the starting substrate. A 50 nm IGZO layer was sputtered using an InGaZnO4 **(1:1:1:4) target in an argon ambient with 7% oxygen, and then patterned and** \netched using dilute HCl. The S/D contact metal (100 nm Mo/Al bilayer) was sputtered and patterned using a lift-off process. A 50 nm PECVD SiO2 **layer was then deposited as the** \ngate dielectric. This was followed by 3 hr O2 anneal at 400 °C with 2 hr controlled rampdown in O2 ambient. The devices were then capped with 10 nm Al2O3 **film using atomic** \nlayer deposition (ALD) at 200 **C. The S/D contact regions were opened using 10:1** \nbuffered HF. The TG electrode was then defined using evaporated Al with a lift-off process. Finally, the samples were implanted with 11B\n+ **at an energy E = 35 keV and dose** \n = 4×1015 cm-2**. Figure 1 shows a cross-sectional schematic of the SA-TG TFT.** \nFigure 1. Cross-sectional schematic of an SA-TG **device, where the textured and nontextured IGZO represents** 11B\n\n![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)\n\n+ **implanted and non-implanted regions, respectively. Note** \nthat in this process scheme the implant is blocked in both channel and S/D metal contact regions. \n\nElectrical testing was done using a B1500 semiconductor parameter analyzer. TFT channel dimensions were of width W = 24 µm and length as indicated. All ID-VGS **transfer** \ncharacteristics presented were taken with a gate voltage up-sweep and medium measurement integration time unless otherwise noted, with low-drain and high-drain bias conditions at 0.1 V and 10 V, respectively. \n\n## Sa-Bg Lithographic Process\n\nThe **SA-BG process investigated had several steps common to the SA-TG process flow,** with a top-side flood exposure and optical thin-film interference used to produce a \"reflection gate\" electrode to serve as an implant mask. Using the same oxidized silicon substrate described previously, a 50 nm thick Mo gate electrode was sputtered and patterned, followed by a PECVD SiO2 **gate dielectric which was densified for 2 hours at** \n600 C in N2. A 50 nm IGZO layer was sputtered using an InGaZnO4 **(1:1:1:4) target in an** \nargon ambient with 7% oxygen, and then patterned and etched using dilute HCl. A 50 nm PECVD SiO2 passivation oxide was then deposited, followed by the O2 **anneal and Al**2O3 capping layers described previously. The wafer was then coated with AZ MIR 701 positive resist following an HMDS vapor prime at 140 °C. Top-side illumination at g-line \n(λ = 436 nm) with an irradiance of ~ 100 mW/cm2 **was done using an exposure array to** \ndetermine the resulting contrast between photoresist lying above the field and gate regions. After exposure, the resist was developed for 45 s in Microposit MF **CD-26 developer** solution and hotplate baked for 60 s at 140 °C. Figure 2 shows cross-sectional schematics of the SA-BG lithographic process. \n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)\n\n## Results & Discussions Sa-Tg Igzo Tft\n\nBoron-doped ZnO has been studied as a potential candidate in solar cell and solid state lighting (11-13). The ZnO:B film has low resistivity, high transparency and broad-band photoluminescence (11). However, the doped regions were not formed selectively; no transistor characteristics were shown in these studies. Compared to polycrystalline ZnO, IGZO has better uniformity and stability due to its amorphous nature. The authors believe this work is the first report of SA IGZO TFTs that have had selectively doped S/D regions formed via boron ion implantation. Figure 3a shows an image of a fabricated SA-TG device with 4 µm gaps between the gate and S/D regions. The high-dose ( = 4×1015 cm-2**) boron** \nimplant was done at 35 keV which is the lower energy limit of the ion implanter used. The implant profile was simulated using SRIM ion-matter interaction software (14), with the predicted distribution shown in Figure 3b. The 50 nm screen oxide represents the gate dielectric above the IGZO. The IGZO material model was specified to have a compositional ratio of In:Ga:Zn:O = 1:1:1:4 and density of 6.1 g/cm3 **(15). The simulation** \nshows that approximately 40 percent of the implanted dose resides within the IGZO film, which translates to an average boron concentration of approximately 3×1020 cm-3. \n\n![3_image_0.png](3_image_0.png)\n\nThe boron implanted IGZO had a measured sheet resistance Rs ~ 9 k**/sq, which assuming** \nan electron mobility µn = 10 cm2**/(Vs) translates to an electron concentration of** \nn ~ 1.4×1019 cm-3**. Note that there was no annealing following the implant process, and the** \norigin of free electrons is not yet certain. This suggests an activation level of between 4 - 5 percent of the boron atoms present, although the level of electrical activation is most likely higher considering mobility degradation due to implant damage and/or the presence of dopant ions. \n\nThe ID-VGS **transfer characteristics of the SA-TG TFT both before and after the boron** \nimplant are shown in Figure 4, along with a comparison to a standard TG coplanar non-SA device. The SA-TG TFT prior to implant has significant series resistance which severely limits current flow. The boron implant increases the on-state current by more than two orders of magnitude, and supports ohmic contact behavior and steep subthreshold operation. The SA-TG characteristic exhibits a shift of approximately -4 V in comparison to the standard TG device; the origin of which requires further investigation. A similar left-shift was observed on implanted TG coplanar devices with metal blocking all IGZO regions, thus it is in some way related to the implant process rather than the presence of implanted boron atoms. Terada-Muta (T-M) analysis was done on SA-TG devices (16), with the T-M plot shown in Figure 5. The common intersection of extrapolated characteristics occurs at ΔL **~2 µm** and a series resistance RDS ~ 8.5 kΩ. **The lateral straggle from the boron implant has a** \nnegligible influence on the effective channel length, however the **L value incorporates** \nprocess biases that are unique to the gate-defined channel length of the SA-TG device. The amount of series resistance equates to approximately \"one square\" of sheet resistance, which is higher than the device layout would suggest. Regardless, the contact behavior is ohmic and has only minor influence on device behavior as shown in Figure 4. \n\n![4_image_0.png](4_image_0.png)\n\n![4_image_1.png](4_image_1.png)\n\n## Sa-Bg Lithographic Process\n\nA preliminary indication of the feasibility of the \"reflection gate\" process was observed during the IGZO mesa lithographic process, which under standard exposure conditions resulted in underexposure over the BG electrode outside of the mesa region while the field area was completely cleared of photoresist. This was then recognized as a potential method for integration into a SA-BG process using a topside flood exposure under optimal exposure conditions. Because of the involvement of interface reflections and thin-film interference the process was found to be extremely sensitive to differences in film thickness and optical properties. For this process to work correctly, the photoresist must mirror the BG polygons with complete coverage. An exposure array with short time increments \n(**t = 0.03 s) was used for open field exposures on resist-coated BG structures in search of** \nsettings that would yield acceptable image contrast with minimal edge exclusion. Select results are shown in Figure 6, along with the exposure times used on the projection stepper system. \n\n![5_image_0.png](5_image_0.png)\n\nThe results shown in Figure 6 suggest that an exposure time of ~ 2.4 s may clear the field of photoresist while maintaining the self-aligned BG image, shown by sample\\#2. However all samples exhibited an edge exclusion, which would result in a significant change in channel length dimension and large gate-S/D overlaps. In addition, the photoresist thickness loss in areas where it did remain may not provide an adequate implant masking layer. The BG image integrity over the mesa is the only region of importance for S/D implant blocking. Unfortunately a suitable process window was not identified within the experimental conditions used. More experiments which investigate other parameters such as the develop process conditions (e.g. time, concentration) are required. \n\n## Summary & Conclusions\n\n1. K. Asama, T. Kodama, S.

This is the first report of the use of IGZO: B for the source drain regions formed selectively via ion implantation with the channel region masked by the gate electrode. The SA-TG devices demonstrated comparable DC characteristics as the standard TG coplanar device, with a minor influence from series resistance. This technique will enable the ability to scale to smaller channel lengths without the associated limitations of a channel length defined by the S/D contact regions. In addition, it overcomes a limitation in the non-SA TG coplanar device which typically exhibits inferior performance over staggered contact designs due to decreased gate capacitance at the S/D metal overlap regions. Results suggest that only a relatively small fraction of the implanted boron atoms present translate to free electrons, however measurements were taken following ion implantation without any additional thermal annealing.

Moreover, reducing the RC\ndelay is also important to achieve high-speed operation, which is induced by the parasitic capacitance formed between the source/drain (S/D) and the gate electrodes. From this perspective, self-aligned top-gate oxide TFTs can provide advantages such as a low parasitic capacitance for high-speed displays due to minimized overlap between the S/D and the gate electrodes. Here, we demonstrate self-aligned top-gate oxide TFTs using a solution-processed indium-gallium-zinc-oxide (IGZO) channel and crosslinked poly(4-vinylphenol) (PVP) gate dielectric layers.

Keywords: self-aligned; top-gate; thin-film transistor; solution process; polymer gate dielectric\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nAmorphous metal-oxide semiconductor-based thin-film transistors (TFTs) have gathered significant interest in active-matrix-driven displays such as organic light-emitting diodes and liquid crystal displays due to their outstanding electrical performance such as high field-effect mobility, low off-state current and excellent electrical stability [1–3]. In addition, their amorphous nature can offer advantages such as high spatial uniformity over a large area, which allows the demonstration of large-size electronics. Despite the advantages of amorphous oxide-based TFTs, the use of the conventional bottom-gate structure often results in the formation of high parasitic capacitance due to the overlap between the source/drain (S/D) and the gate electrodes [4]. This can cause a significant RC\ndelay during the operation of the displays, resulting in degradation of the image quality. To resolve this issue, specifically to reduce the effects of parasitic capacitance, a self-aligned top-gate structure has been adopted in oxide TFTs [5]. By using the self-aligned structure, the overlapped area between the gate and S/D electrodes can be significantly reduced, resulting in a decrease in parasitic capacitance as well as the RC delay.\n\nTo realize the self-aligned top-gate oxide TFTs, the S/D contact regions in IGZO channel should have high electrical conductivity. Previously, various doping elements such as aluminum and fluorine have been investigated [6,7]. By doping these elements into the metal contact regions of IGZO\nfilm, the electrical conductivity can be significantly increased, allowing low-contact resistance with the S/D metals. Although doping these metallic or halogen atoms is effective in increasing the conductivity, a sophisticated ion implantation equipment is typically required to dope the elements into the oxide channel layer. Additionally, a hydrogen-doping process was also suggested to form the S/D contact regions [8]. However, the hydrogen atoms are highly mobile and rather unstable at high temperatures [9]. Therefore, controlling the concentration of hydrogen may be difficult, especially when using a high process temperature. Compared to these approaches, a simple argon (Ar)\nplasma treatment can also be used to form the S/D contact regions [10]. Particularly, by the Ar plasma treatment, the oxygen vacancy concentration in the exposed regions can be increased, which leads to an increase in electrical conductivity. Moreover, the Ar plasma process requires relatively simple process equipment compared to other doping methods and only requires a short process time to obtain high electrical conductivity [11]. Therefore, by optimizing the Ar plasma process, self-aligned top-gate oxide TFTs can be simply realized.\n\nFurthermore, solution processing of oxide channel as well as the gate dielectric can offer potential advantages such as the non-vacuum and scalable fabrication of high-performance oxide TFTs. Particularly, for the gate dielectric layer, the utilization of insulating polymers can be effective in simplifying the fabrication process and lowering the process temperature [12]. Due to the low Young's modulus of the polymers, the mechanical flexibility of the TFTs can be improved [13]. Among the various polymer insulators, crosslinked poly(4-vinylphenol) (PVP) gate dielectric has been widely studied in organic TFT devices owing to its relatively high dielectric constant and good electrical stability [14]. The PVP gate dielectric can be solution-processed at a relatively low temperature, typically below 200 ◦C.\n\nHere, we report self-aligned top-gate oxide TFTs using solution-processed indium-gallium-zincoxide (IGZO) channel and crosslinked PVP gate dielectric layers. For the realization of self-aligned top-gate structure, a selective Ar plasma treatment was applied at the S/D contact regions of the IGZO\nchannel. With optimized Ar plasma treatment condition, the sheet resistance of IGZO film could be reduced to ~20.6 kΩ/sq. The fabricated self-aligned top-gate IGZO TFTs exhibited a field-effect mobility of 3.93 cm2/Vs and on/off ratio of ~106. Additionally, we also demonstrate self-aligned top-gate TFTs using electrospun indium-gallium-oxide (IGO) nanowires (NWs) as a channel layer. The fabricated IGO NW TFTs exhibited a field-effect mobility of 0.03 cm2/Vs and on/off ratio of >105. The results shown that the Ar plasma treatment for S/D contact formation and the solution-processed PVP gate dielectric can be implemented in realizing self-aligned top-gate oxide TFTs.\n\n## 2. Experimental Procedure\n\nTo prepare the IGZO precursor solution, indium nitrate hydrate, gallium nitrate hydrate and zinc nitrate hydrate were dissolved in 2-methoxyethanol at a total concentration of 0.125 M. Before use, the solution was thoroughly stirred at 75 ◦C for around 24 h. The molar ratio of In:Ga:Zn was 6.8:1.0:2.2.\n\nTo fabricate the self-aligned top-gate IGZO TFTs, the IGZO precursor solution was spin-coated on a Si/SiO2 wafer and thermal annealed at 350 ◦C for 1 h. The IGZO channel was then patterned by photolithography and wet etching. For the gate dielectric, a PVP solution was first prepared by dissolving PVP powder, poly(melamine-co-formaldehyde) in propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate with a weight ratio of 10:5:85, respectively. After stirring, the PVP solution was spin-coated onto the patterned IGZO layer and baked at 150 ◦C for 30 min. The thickness of PVP layer was\n~718 nm, which was measured by a surface profiler (alpha-step IQ, KLA Tencor, Milpitas, CA, USA).\n\nThen, Cr was deposited as a top gate electrode with a thickness of 50 nm. The patterning of Cr gate electrode was carried out by using a metal shadow mask. To etch the PVP gate dielectric, an O2 plasma process was carried out at 100 W for 3 min. During the PVP etching process, the Cr gate electrode worked as a screening mask for patterning the underneath PVP layer. Afterward, to form S/D contact regions, an Ar plasma process was performed at 50 W for 0~180 s (Asher, RIE system, SNTEK Co., Ltd., Suwon, Korea).\n\nFor the fabrication of IGO NW TFTs, an electrospinning process was carried out. First, an IGO\nprecursor solution was prepared by dissolving indium nitrate hydrate and gallium nitrate hydrate in a solution containing 0.7 g of polyvinylpyrrolidone (Mw~1,300,000) and 5 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide\n(DMF). The mixed solution was then stirred for 24 h at room temperature. To fabricate the TFTs, the IGO precursor solution was electrospun on a Si/SiO2 wafer (ESR200R2, NanoNC, Seoul, Korea).\n\nThe solution was ejected from a needle (23 gauge) at an electrical field of 13 kV for 15 s. The distance between the needle and the substrate was around 15 cm. The ejected NW composite was baked at 150 ◦C, and then finally annealed at 450 ◦C for 2 h to remove polyvinylpyrrolidone and other organic components in the solvent. The rest of the TFT fabrication processes were identical to the IGZO TFTs.\n\nTo measure the sheet resistance of the Ar plasma-treated IGZO films, IGZO films were coated on bare glass substrates. The sheet resistance was measured using a 4-point probe measurement system\n(CMT-SR1000N, AIT, Suwon, Korea). To evaluate the change in the oxygen binding states in IGZO\nfilms, depending on the Ar plasma time, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried out (ESCALAB 250, Thermo scientific, Rockford, IL, USA). The capacitance of the PVP gate dielectric was measured by using a precision LCR meter (Agilent 4284A) and the leakage current density of PVP gate dielectric and the electrical characteristics of IGZO and IGO NW TFTs were analyzed using a semiconductor parameter analyzer (Agilent 4155C). The microstructure of IGO NW channels was analyzed using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM; JSM-7600F, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan).\n\n## 3. Results And Discussion\n\nThe fabrication process and schematic device structure of self-aligned top-gate IGZO TFTs are shown in Figure 1. As described, the PVP gate dielectric is patterned using O2 plasma etching using Cr gate electrode as a screening mask. Under the etched PVP layer, IGZO regions for S/D\ncontacts are then exposed. However, due to the low electrical conductivity of the intrinsic IGZO film, high contact resistance and, subsequently, a large voltage drop can occur at these regions. To increase the conductivity of the IGZO film and to build a homojunction channel structure, an Ar plasma treatment was carried out. Here, due to the Cr gate and PVP gate dielectric layers, only the S/D\ncontact regions are exposed to Ar plasma, as shown in Figure 1. To investigate the effect of Ar plasma treatment on the electrical conductivity of IGZO film, Ar plasma time was varied from 0 to 180 s.\n\nFigure 2a shows the variation in sheet resistance as a function of Ar plasma time. The intrinsic IGZO\nfilm without the Ar plasma treatment exhibited a sheet resistance of 317.9 kΩ/sq., which decreased to 20.6 kΩ/sq. and 51.1 kΩ/sq. after 30 and 60 s of Ar plasma treatment, respectively. The main reason for the resistance decrease by the Ar plasma treatment can be ascribed to the formation of oxygen vacancies in the IGZO film [9]. Specifically, the energetic Ar+ bombardment during the plasma process can induce preferential sputtering of relatively lighter atoms from the film surface, such as the oxygen atoms in the IGZO film [10]. The relatively heavier atoms such as indium, gallium and zinc have a lower sputtering yield, therefore, oxygen vacancies are preferentially formed near the surface region. By the formation of oxygen vacancies, excess free electrons are generated in the film, which increase the carrier concentration and the conductivity of IGZO film [15]. Interestingly, the sheet resistance was saturated at around 30~60 s of Ar plasma treatment time. This can be attributed to the reaching of a steady-state condition at which the sputtering yield of oxygen atoms balances those of metal atoms in the oxygen-deficient IGZO region [ 10 ]. However, by increasing the Ar plasma treatment time up to 180 s, the sheet resistance could not be measured, mainly due to the high resistance of the IGZO film.\n\nTo investigate the influence of Ar plasma treatment on the oxygen-binding states of IGZO film and the formation of oxygen vacancies, an XPS analysis was carried out. Figure 2 b shows the variation in metal–oxygen (M-O), oxygen vacancy (O vac ), and metal hydroxide (M-OH) binding states in IGZO films as a function of Ar plasma time. Figure 2c–f also shows the series of O 1s peaks obtained from IGZO films treated with different Ar plasma timea. Here, the O 1s peaks are de-convoluted into three main peaks, M-O, O vac and M-OH. The peaks centered at around 530, 531 and ~532 eV correspond to M-O, O vac and M-OH binding states, respectively. Overall, as the Ar plasma time increased, the portion of M-O states was significantly decreased from 53.2% to 5.5%, while the portions of O vac and M-OH\nstates increased from 25.5% to 64.0% and from 21.4% to 30.6%, respectively.  As aforementioned, a continuous exposure to Ar plasma can induce a substantial increase in oxygen vacancies which can contribute to an increase in electrical conductivity. Therefore, the abrupt decrease in sheet resistance observed at the Ar plasma time of 30~60 s can be attributed to the generation of significant amounts of oxygen vacancies in the IGZO film. Interestingly, the sheet resistance was slightly higher when the Ar plasma time was increased from 30 to 60 s. It was also observed that a prolonged Ar plasma treatment\n(180 s) induced a high increase in sheet resistance (not measurable by the 4-point probe method). It is speculated that the significant generation of defective M-OH binding states, as well as a substantial decrease in M-O binding states, are responsible for the increase in sheet resistance.\n\n![3_image_0.png](3_image_0.png)\n\n![3_image_1.png](3_image_1.png)\n\n![4_image_0.png](4_image_0.png)\n\n![4_image_1.png](4_image_1.png)\n\nFor the self-aligned top-gate IGZO TFTs, a crosslinked PVP gate dielectric was used. The PVP\ngate dielectric has been used in organic TFIs owing to its high dielectric constant, low leakage current, and low-temperature solution processability [ 16 ].  To investigate the dielectric properties of the crosslinked PVP gate dielectric layer, the capacitance vs. frequency and the current density vs. electric field (J-E) were analyzed. As shown in Figure 3a, the PVP gate dielectric exhibited relatively stable capacitance characteristics up to 1 MHz, with a relatively large decrease in capacitance at 1 MHz. It is reported that the unreacted hydroxyl groups remaining in the PVP gate dielectric can be responsible for the frequency-dependent capacitance variation [ 17 ].  Particularly, the unreacted hydroxyl groups can easily attract the water molecules and mobile ions, which results in slow polarization and low capacitance value at high frequencies.  Furthermore, the J-E characteristics are shown in Figure 3 b. The PVP gate dielectric exhibited a low leakage current density of <2 × 10 −9 A/cm 2 up to an electric field of ~0.7 MV/cm. Although some hysteresis behaviors were observed during the double sweep measurement, the overall current density values were low, in the range of 10 -9 ~10 -12 A/cm 2 .\n\nNonetheless, the results of capacitance and the leakage current density show that the crosslinked PVP\nflm can be a possible candidate for a gate dielectric in top-gate oxide TFTs.\n\n![4_image_2.png](4_image_2.png)\n\nUsing the solution-processed PVP gate dielectric, self-aligned top-gate IGZO TFTs were fabricated\nand their electrical characteristics were measured. Figure 4a,b shows the transfer and output\ncharacteristics of the top-gate IGZO TFTs, respectively, having a channel width (W) of 1000 µm and\nchannel length (L) of 100 µm. In this case, the Ar plasma treatment for the S/D contact formation was\nperformed for 30 s, which exhibited the lowest sheet resistance (Figure 2a). As shown in Figure 4a,\nthe top-gate IGZO TFTs exhibited a decent switching behavior with a current on/off ratio of ~106 and\nthreshold voltage (Vth) of 4.04 ± 1.53 V. The saturation field-effect mobility (µ) was calculated using the\nfollowing equation\n$$\\mathrm{I_{D}={\\frac{W}{2L}}\\mu C_{i}(V_{G}-V_{t h})^{2}}$$\n2(1)\nwhere ID is the drain current, L and W are the channel length and width, respectively, Ciis the areal capacitance of the gate dielectric, and Vg is gate voltage. The saturation field-effect mobility was 3.93 ± 0.22 cm2/Vs which is comparable to those fabricated with SiO2 gate dielectric layer [18]. On the other hand, without the Ar plasma treatment, the device showed no switching behavior or charge accumulation. As shown in Figure 4c,d, the drain current (ID) was not varied by the gate bias (VG) and remained at current levels of 10−11~10−12 A. This can be attributed to the high resistivity of the S/D\ncontact regions in the IGZO channel. Due to the high resistance in these regions, a substantial voltage drop can occur at these contacts, which decreases the effective bias applied at the channel region [19].\n\nAs a result, the drain current level can be comparably lower than the devices with low-resistance S/D\ncontact regions. In addition, the parasitic capacitance of the self-aligned top-gate IGZO TFTs were analyzed in the range of 102~106 Hz. As shown in Figure 4e, even though the PVP has slightly lower dielectric constant (ε~3.6) than the SiO2 (ε~3.9), and thicker than the SiO2 gate dielectric (thickness\n~200 nm), the parasitic capacitance values measured in top-gate IGZO TFTs were comparably lower than that of the bottom-gate IGZO TFTs in most of the frequency range. Nonetheless, these results clearly show that the Ar plasma treatment is effective in lowering the electrical resistivity of IGZO\nchannel at the S/D contact regions, which is required to operate the self-aligned top-gate oxide TFTs.\n\nThe strategy of using Ar plasma treatment and PVP gate dielectric for self-aligned top-gate oxide TFTs has been further applied to oxide NW TFTs. Here, electrospun IGO NWs were adopted as a channel layer, as shown in Figure 5a. After electrospinning and annealing the IGO NWs, a PVP gate dielectric was spin-coated over the IGO NW channel. Afterward, deposition and patterning of Cr gate electrode, and Ar plasma treatment for S/D contact formation were carried out. Additionally, as S/D\nelectrodes, aluminum electrode was deposited over the IGO NWs. Figure 5b shows an optical image of the fabricated self-aligned top-gate IGO NW TFTs. The FESEM image of the IGO NW channel is also displayed. The sheet resistance variation in the IGO NW film was evaluated for different Ar plasma treatment times, as shown in Figure 5c. Before the Ar plasma, the IGO NW film exhibited a sheet resistance of 45.9 MΩ/sq., while it gradually decreased to 7.2 MΩ/sq. when the Ar plasma time was increased to 60 s. The sheet resistance value was also saturated after around 30 s, similar to that observed in IGZO films. Figure 5d,e show the transfer and output characteristics of the self-aligned top-gate IGO NW TFTs with an Ar plasma time of 30 s. The device showed good switching behavior with an on/off ratio of 105~106, Vth of 9.58 ± 0.53 V and field-effect mobility of 0.03 ± 0.005 cm2/Vs.\n\nThe relatively low mobility compared to the IGZO TFTs can be attributed to the low area coverage of IGO NWs in the channel region. Compared to thin-film type channels, the IGO NWs only cover partial areas of the channel region in which the electrons are transported. For the calculation of field-effect mobility using Equation (1), we used the dimension of the IGO NW channel (W = 1000 µm).\n\nNonetheless, the results also show that the Ar plasma treatment for S/D contact formation and PVP\ngate dielectric can be used to realize oxide NW-based TFTs.\n\n![6_image_0.png](6_image_0.png)\n\n![6_image_1.png](6_image_1.png)\n\nTo further investigate the influence of Ar plasma treatment on the semiconductor/metal contact properties in IGO NW TFTs, the contact resistance was calculated using the transmission line method (TLM) [20]. As described, excess electrons are generated by the formation of oxygen vacancies during the Ar plasma treatment. In addition, by the Ar+ bombardment, some heat can be generated on the IGO NW surface, which, in turn, induces some electrons to diffuse into the IGO channel region below the Cr/PVP layers, forming a parasitic resistance [21]. Here, the effective channel length\n(Leff) can be calculated by subtracting the diffused regions (∆L) from the actual channel length (L).\n\nAccordingly, the total resistance of the channel (RT) can be expressed as the following [22–24]\nTo further investigate the influence of Ar plasma treatment on the semiconductor/metal contact properties in IGO NW TFTs, the contact resistance was calculated using the transmission line method \n(TLM) [20].

Here, the crosspoint (x,y) made between the two fitted lines indicates x = 2·ΔL and y = 2·R0. From the plots, the extracted values of ΔL and width-normalized parasitic resistance (R0·W) were ~13.5 µm and 350 kΩcm, respectively.

Finally, recent progress and perspective of oxide TFT based on new oxide semiconductors, 2DEG, and low-temperature solution processed oxide semiconductor for flexible electronics will be reviewed.\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nWide bandgap oxide semiconductors (e.g., ZnO, In2O3, SnO2, and Ga2O3) combine the properties of visible-light transparency, high conductivity, and high electron mobility in a single material. These unique properties offer a variety of uses in commercialized optoelectronic devices (**Figure** 1).[1] For example, Sndoped In2O3 (ITO) thin films grown on glass can exhibit a high electrical conductivity of ≈104 S  cm−1 and a high transparency J.

The global ITO market has an annual growth rate of 15% and is valued at 7 billion USD in 2019. In 2004, Nomura and Hosono et al. made great  breakthrough in oxide thin film transistor (TFT) based on amorphous indium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO) grown at room temperature.[3] The amorphous IGZO showed an impressive mobility of 9 cm2 V−1 s−1, about 10 times of amorphous hydrogenated Si TFT which was used exclusively for displays at that time. Soon after Hosono's seminal work, IGZO \nTFT was commercialized by Sharp Corporation in 2012, and then rapidly expanded to mobile phones, tablets and laptops.[4] In 2019, the fifth generation IGZO TFT went to mass production, capable of driving large-area displays (85 in.) with ultrahigh 8 K resolution.[5] Moreover, oxide TFTs are also considered as the most promising transistors for next-generation curved, flexible, or even rollable electronics.[6]\nThe great success of oxide semiconductors is underpinned by their unique electronic structure, amenability for n-type doping, as well as intrinsic stability. Oxide semiconductors have bandgap larger than 3  eV, enabling transparency in the visible spectrum. The conduction band (CB) of oxide semiconductors is typically composed of empty ns-orbitals (n ≥ 4) \nof heavy posttransition metals. The large, spherical ns-orbitals give rise to a high electron mobility even in amorphous phases, as well as high dopability for hosting a high density of electrons. Therefore, oxide semiconductors are amendable via doping to be a transparent semiconductor or a transparent conductor, depending on the purposes of device applications, e.g., TFT or ITO. However, there are two sides to every coin. The nature of electronic structure of oxide semiconductors also leads to the fundamental limitation of achieving p-type oxide semiconductors, which is exacerbated by the presence of a high background electron density arising from the formation of unintentional defects and impurities.[1a,7] The lack of p-type semiconductor significantly limits the great potential of oxide electronics.[7b] A \nhigh electron density and defect states cause detrimental effects on oxide TFT device performance, such as a high off-current, lower mobility, and instability issues.[8] In the past two decades, considerable research efforts have been made to understand the microscopic origin of defect states and background electrons Figure 1. A variety of applications and emerging technologies based on wide bandgap oxide semiconductors.\n\npresent in oxide semiconductors.[9] Substantial progress have also been made for designing new p-type oxide semiconductors by modulating the electronic structure of oxides.\n\nThe other exciting milestone of oxide semiconductors is the formation of 2D electron gas (2DEG) with outstanding mobility of >1 × 106 cm2 V–1 s–1 at the ZnO/MgZnO heterointerface that enabled exotic integer and fractional quantum Hall effect.[10]\nSuch 2DEGs can also been created in many other heterointerface and surface of oxide semiconductors.[11] The 2DEGs offer great promise for achieving high electron mobility transistors (HEMT) and other quantum devices.\n\nIn spite of above-mentioned great success, there are a range of challenges be addressed: i. Both ITO and IGZO contain the expensive and rare element, indium. With the booming demand from flat panel displays and solar cells, the price of indium ($390 000 per ton) is comparable to that of silver. The market fluctuates widely because of the high risk of supply. Therefore, extensive research efforts have been made to search for alternative materials to ITO and IGZO, or to reduce the use of indium raw materials.\n\nii. The prospects of oxide electronics are greatly limited by the lack of p-type oxide semiconductors. P-type oxide semiconductors along with n-type counterparts would enable the realization of p–n junctions and complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) logic circuits. Furthermore, p-channel TFTs are more suitable to drive OLED as they consist of bottom hole injection electrode structures.[12] The development of high-performance p-type oxide semiconductors is indispensable.\n\niii. Emerging flexible electronics calls for flexible transparent electrodes and flexible TFTs, bringing new requirements for high-throughput, low-cost fabrication of oxide semiconductors on plastic substrates.\n\niv. Subband defect states generated by native defects and/or impurities in oxide semiconductors deteriorate TFT device performance and induce negative bias illumination stress \n(NBIS) instability issue in commercialized oxide TFTs.[8d]\nA detailed understanding of the origin of defect states and in-turn a strategy to reduce them, is crucial for current and emerging device applications.\n\nIn the past decades, substantial research progress has been made to address these challenges and opportunities. This article will provide an up-to-date review on both the fundamental understanding of the materials physics of oxide semiconductors, and recent advances on the new material design and high-performing TFT devices in the context of these fundamental understanding. In Section 2, we will first present an overview on the materials physics of oxide semiconductors in terms of electronic structure, transport and optical properties, defect and doping chemistry, which form essential guiding principles for the design of new materials and device optimization. Bearing these principles in mind, we will then review recent advances in design of p-type oxide semiconductors, and high mobility 2DEG at oxide surfaces and interfaces with fascinating physical properties. In Section 3, we will focus on material principles of transparent electrode materials, and recent new material design concept for cost-effective transparent and flexible conducting electrodes. Finally, recent progress and perspective of oxide TFT will be reviewed in Section 4, including the historical development and current issue of IGZO-based TFTs, design of high mobility TFTs based on new oxide materials and 2DEG \ncreated at oxide heterointerfaces, p-type oxide TFTs, and lowtemperature solution processed oxides for emerging flexible electronics.\n\n## 2. Materials Physics Of Oxide Semiconductor And Advances In Design Of New Materials\n\nThe advantages of oxide semiconductors result from its unique electronic structure and amenability for n-type doping. This section will provide an in-depth overview on the semiconductor physics of oxide semiconductors with respect to electronic structure, defect chemistry, transport and optical properties. We will also review recent advances on p-type oxide semiconductors which still represents one of the biggest challenges in the field. Recent discovery and creation of high mobility 2DEG at the surfaces and interfaces of oxide semiconductors will also be discussed.\n\n## 2.1. Electronic Structure And The Origin Of High Mobility\n\nBased on an ionic model, the top of the valence band (VB) \nof an oxide semiconductor is primarily formed by fully occupied oxygen 2p6, and the bottom of CB by unoccupied outer \n\n![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)\n\n \n\n![2_image_1.png](2_image_1.png)\n\nns orbitals of metal cations, e.g., Zn 4s, Ga 4s, In 5s, Sn 5s. \n\nFigure 2a depicts the schematic electronic structure of In2O3 as an example. Because the s orbitals of metal cations, e.g., In 5s, have a large spatial size and spread almost spherically, the s orbital can overlap extensively with neighboring s orbitals (Figure  2b). Such extensive orbital overlapping provides a facile pathway for conduction of electrons. From the point view of band structure, the s orbitals form a highly dispersive and delocalized CB minimum (CBM), thus facilitating a small electron effective mass (m*) and a high electron mobility. As an example, Figure 2c plots the band structure of In2O3 calculated by density functional theory (DFT), showing a highly dispersive CBM at Γ point.[13] Other oxide semiconductors such as ZnO, Ga2O3, IGZO and SnO2 also have small m* of 0.20–0.35 me (me is the rest mass of an electron) and reasonably high electron mobility of 200 cm2 V–1 s–1 (**Table** 1).[14] Moreover, the spherical symmetry of s orbitals also makes their overlapping insensitive to local bonding structure. As such, even in a disordered amorphous phase, effective orbital overlapping can be maintained and the oxide semiconductors still show a high electron mobility. For example, the calculated electron effective mass of amorphous IGZO (0.2 me)\n[15] is close to that of single crystal IGZO (0.18 me).[16] As reported in the seminal work by Hosono et  al., a high mobility of 10 cm2 V–1 s–1 was obtained in amorphous IGZO based TFT,[3b] in comparison with 80 cm2 V–1 s–1 found in crystalline IGZO based TFT.[3a] Having an amorphous structure leads to the advantages of low processing temperature, low cost, and the ability to scale-up for large-area substrates with excellent uniformity.\n\nSuch unique characteristics of oxide semiconductors are different from conventional semiconductors such as Si, in which the chemical bonds are made of sp3 orbitals with strong spatial directivity. Highly crystalline Si exhibits a high mobility of \n≈1500 cm2 V–1 s–1 (Table 1).[17] However, if the crystal structure Table 1.

Chemistry Of Defects And Impurities\n\nAccurate control of the defect and doping in oxide semiconductors underpins their device applications as transparent conducting electrodes, active materials for TFT, or electron/ hole transport layer in perovskite solar cells. Because of the d-block contraction, the outer ns orbitals of Zn, Ga, In, and Sn that form the CBM have low energy, giving rise to a large electron affinity that facilitates n-type doping for oxide semiconductors. Therefore, oxide semiconductors can be heavily doped to achieve a very high conductivity of 2  × 104 S cm–1, while maintaining a high transparency to visible light, giving rise to the so-called transparent conducting oxide (TCO). TCOs have a wide range of applications as transparent electrodes in flat panel displays, touch screen in smart phones, low-emissivity glass, and solar cells. However, for oxide semiconductors to be used as channel semiconductors in TFTs, a low carrier concentration of less than 1015 cm−3 is preferred, so that the current in the channel can be effectively modulated via electrostatic gating. However, undoped oxide semiconductors, even with highly crystalline quality, typically exhibit considerable n-type conductivity due to unintentional incorporation of native defects or impurities. Table 1 summarizes the conductivity and background electron concentrations (n) in undoped oxides. \n\nThe values of n in In2O3 are in the range of 1017–1019 cm−3,\n[19]\nSnO2 of 1015–1018 cm−3,\n[20] ZnO of 1015–1019 cm−3,\n[21] Ga2O3 of 1013–1019 cm−3,\n[22] and IGZO of 1014–1020 cm−3 etc.[23] Moreover, for TFT applications, unintentional defects and impurities also affect electronic properties, such as mobility, create deep level in-gap states, and impact optical properties; these factors are critical to TFT device characteristics and stability. Therefore, a detailed understanding of the chemistry of unintentional defects and impurities in oxide semiconductors, which in turn allows us to accurately control them, is crucial for current and emerging device applications. Over the past decades, considerable research efforts have been made to understand native defects and impurities present in oxide semiconductors. Proposed electron donors giving rise to the n-type conductivity include oxygen vacancies (VOs), hydrogen impurity, residual impurities from materials synthesis process, and surface 2D electron gas (2DEG), but no consensus has been reached yet. This section will review recent understanding of chemistry of these defects and impurities.\n\n## 2.2.1. Oxygen Vacancies (Vos)\n\nOxygen vacancies have long-time been suspected as the sources of n-type conductivity, because it was often experimentally observed that the conductivity of oxide semiconductors strongly \n\n![3_image_0.png](3_image_0.png)\n\ndepend on the oxygen partial pressure during the growth or post-growth treatment: highly oxidizing environments reducing the electron density, whereas reducing conditions leading to an increase in n-type conductivity.[19a,21a,22b,23c,24] Oxygen partial pressure is the most critical parameter to tune for optimization of growth of oxide semiconductor thin films. However, recent efforts based on state-of-the-art DFT calculations demonstrated that, although VOs have the lowest formation energy and can easily form in many oxide semiconductors, the transition levels of VOs are usually deep in energy and cannot be ionized efficiently for n-type conductivity.[25] For example, it was reported the ε(2+/0) transition levels of VOs in ZnO[25a,26] and Ga2O3\n[25g]\nare located at ≈1 eV below the CBM. The large activation energy of VOs suggests that they are hard to be ionized to provide free electrons in CB. It has also been reported that VOs in SnO2 are also deep donors, with an ionization energy of 1.8  eV.[25d]\nTherefore, VOs cannot be the origin of n-type conductivity in these oxides. On the other hand, some theoretical works predicted that the VOs in In2O3 may act as shallow donors.[27] Very recently, Chatratin et al.[27b] performed a comprehensive investigation of the impact of native point defects in In2O3 using hybrid functional of Heyd-Scuseria- Ernzenhof (HSE), and found that the ε(2+/+) transition level of VOs is at 0.11 eV below the CBM. Hence, VOs likely act as shallow donors in In2O3, when the carrier concentration is low. However, for high electron concentrations where the Fermi level is higher than the CBM, VOs will become electrically inactive. The more \"active\" VOs in In2O3 likely result from the lying low In 5s derived CBM.\n\nThe deep donor levels of VOs were also corroborated by experimental measurements using optical spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance, and deep-level transient spectroscopy.[28] High-resolution X-ray photoemission spectroscopy available at advanced synchrotron lights have been extensively used to study the occupied density of states below the Fermi level.[29] Interestingly, localized in-gap states lying above the VBM have been commonly observed in oxygen-deficient In2O3, SnO2, and IGZO thin films. Annealing the samples in O2 conditions reduced the gap states. It has been argued that the in-gap states in IGZO is associated with VOs, responsible for the photoexcitation of sub-band state for the negative bias illumination stress (NBIS) instability in TFT devices.[30] It is also worth noting that, although VOs in crystalline IGZO were shown to be deep donors, recent works by Vogt et  al.[31] and Noh et  al.[32] suggested that in a-IGZO, while most VOs are deep donors, some of the VOs may act as shallow donors due to locally different environments from those in the crystalline phase.\n\n## 2.2.2. Hydrogen Impurities\n\nHydrogen impurities have been increasingly proposed to act as shallow donors in oxide semiconductors. Hydrogen is certainly a ubiquitous impurity in conventional semiconductors, present in many growth conditions.[33] A high density of hydrogen impurities have also been found in magnetron sputtering grown IGZO with a concentration of 1020 cm−3,\n[34] hydride vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE) grown Ga2O3,\n[33f] and flux grown In2O3 single crystals.[35]\n\nThe chemistry of hydrogen in oxide semiconductor is quite complex.[33a,36] Hydrogen can be incorporated as interstitials \n(Hi) and as substitution at the oxygen sites (HO),[25g,37] and can be neutral Ho(inactive), H+ (donor) and H− (acceptor). \n\nBoth Hi and HO have been predicted to be shallow donors, and were further experimentally verified by *Muon*-spinresonance,[33e,38] infrared spectroscopy,[34b,39] photoluminescence spectroscopy,[37b,40] SIMS,[37c] and phenomenal evidence that annealing the samples in hydrogen substantially increase the n-type conductivity.[41] Hi have low formation energy if H2 or H2O are present during the growth or postgrowth treatment. Hi exist in the form of OH by bonding with lattice oxygen. This formation of OH bonding has been predicted to occur generally in ZnO,[33b] In2O3\n[33c] and IGZO,[30b] SnO2.\n\n[33d]\nFurthermore, infrared spectroscopy studies also detected vibrational line in the 3200–3500 cm−1 range associated with OH \nstretch modes in In2O3, SnO2, and IGZO. Meanwhile, it was found that the Hi are highly mobile even at room temperature, and can easily diffuse out of the sample.[25d,33c,35,42] This indicates that Hi is probably not stable, and it can be eliminated by annealing with certain temperature. On the other hand, the HO is much more stable than Hi. For example, Janotti and Van de Walle showed that hydrogen can substitute for oxygen sites in ZnO[33a] and SnO2,\n[25d] becoming fourfold and threefold coordinated, respectively. By stabilizing at lattice sites, the HOs are much more thermally stable than Hi. The incorporation of H \nimpurities may originate from various sources, including the growth atmosphere, molecules absorbed on sputtering targets, hydrogen contained precursors (e.g., H2O) used for CVD or ALD growth and the post-annealing processes.[8d,43]\nIn addition to VOs and hydrogen impurities, other residual impurities (Si, C, F, etc.) may also be present in bulk crystals, typically at a concentration of a few ppm by weight.[22a] The sources of the residual impurities may come from starting precursors, containers and crucibles, growth chambers and furnaces. For example, it has been shown that Si is the main impurity present in high-purity Ga2O3 powders[44] and single crystals.[45] The Si impurity concentrations are determined at 10–20  ppm (weight) for 6N (99.9999%) high-purity Ga2O3, which corresponds to a Si concentration of 1016–1017 cm−3. This value would give comparable electron density observed in unintentional doped Ga2O3.\n\n## 2.3. 2D Electron Gas (2Deg) And 2D Hole Gas (2Dhg) At Oxide Surfaces And Interfaces\n\nThe surface and interface of oxide semiconductor play a crucial role for their device applications, and have been extensively studied. Recently, 2DEG has been found generally at the surfaces of oxide semiconductors, including CdO,[46]\nIn2O3,\n[29a,d,47] SnO2,\n[29c,48] ZnO,[46b,49] IGZO,[29b] and possibly Ga2O3.\n\n[50] The 2DEG is confined at a few nanometers of near surface region, exhibiting properties such as increased electron mobility and reduced bandgap. Furthermore, 2DEG \ncan also be created by modulating charge transfer at the interfaces of MgxZn1–xO/ZnO,[51] LaAlO3/SrTiO3,\n[52] In2O3/\nZnO,[53] and (AlxGa1–x)2O3/Ga2O3.\n\n[11d,54] The interface 2DEG \nhas been demonstrated to show extremely high mobility of \n>1  × 106 cm2 V–1 s–1 at the MgZnO/ZnO interface, as well as exotic integer and fractional quantum hall effect.[51] The 2DHG \nhas also been reported at the interfaces of SrTiO3/LaAlO3/\nSrTiO3 and FeOy/SrTiO3 lately.[55] These new properties offer great potential for design of novel electronic devices. This section will review recent research progress on the creation and understanding of the 2DEG and 2DHG at both surfaces and interfaces of oxide semiconductors. The oxide 2DEG based TFT devices will be presented in Section 4.4.\n\n## 2.3.1. Surface 2Deg\n\nFor conventional n-type semiconductors such as Si[56] and GaAs,[57] negatively charged surface states cause a depleted space charge region and upward band bending near the surface. This has been long thought to be the situation at the surface of n-type oxide semiconductors such as In2O3.\n\n[58] However, during the past decade, a series of studies performed on high-quality, low-defect single crystals or epitaxial thin films suggested the opposite situation where a surface electron accumulation layer (SEAL) confined within a few nm thick near the surface region with a concomitant downward band bending at the surfaces of CdO,[46a–e] In2O3,\n[29a,d,47] SnO2,\n[29c,48] ZnO,[46b,49]\nIGZO,[29b] and Ga2O3.\n\n[50] Furthermore, the downward band bending creates a confining potential well, leading to quantization of 2DEG. It should be mentioned that, although the SEAL \nis only a few nm thick, such layer can have a pronounced effect on the electronic properties of oxide films and the subsequent device performance. First, the SEAL is the core of the use of oxide semiconductors in conductometric ultrasensitive gas sensors.[58b] Second, the surface is where the electronic contacts are made. Depending on the type of devices, either Ohmic contact or Schottky contacts are needed. The existence of 2DEG \nfavors the formation of Ohmic contacts, while the formation of Schottky contacts required for several other applications is hindered.[59] Third, the 2DEG in the SEAL exhibits high mobility and new quantum phenomena, which offers new possibilities for the design of novel devices.[29d] Therefore, understanding of the origin of the SEAL, which can be purposely tuned, is of great importance to unlock the entire spectrum of potential device applications.\n\nIn the following, we will take In2O3 as an example to illustrate the properties of surface 2DEG. Using a series of photoemission spectroscopy measurements available at synchrotron light sources, King et al.[47a] and Zhang et al.[29a] demonstrated the existence of a SEAL of ≈5  nm thick and downward band bending of ≈0.4  eV at the surface of single crystalline In2O3 thin films, as shown in **Figure** 3. The pronounced downward band bending causes the CB states to become quantized into 2D subband states, i.e., 2DEG, which has been observed directly by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). The sheet electron concentration of the 2DEG is 4.2 × 1013 cm−2. The electron density is much larger than that typically observed in conventional semiconductor interfaces such as Si metal-oxidesemiconductor field effect transistors or at the GaAs/\nAlGaAs interface.[60] Interestingly, owing to the high electron density at the SEAL, many-body interactions within the SEAL becomes important, leading to a shrinkage of the \n\n![4_image_0.png](4_image_0.png)\n\n![5_image_0.png](5_image_0.png)\n\nbandgap at the surface, [61] also similar to 2DEG in other oxide semiconductors. [46 f] Because of modification of the bandgap, it was also observed that the electrons at 2DEG have smaller effective mass, in comparison with that in the bulk, implying an increase of mobility. 1621 Very recently, Papadogianni et al. [476]\ndetermined the transport properties at the SEAL and found a high Hall electron mobility of up to µ = 155 cm 2 V − 1 s − 1 .\n\nThe microscopic origin of the surface 2DEG in In 2 O 3 has been attributed to surface concomitant V O S acting as doubly ionized shallow donors, [256] and recently it was suggested that surface In adatoms which are more energetically favored over V S , can also act as shallow donors. [63] The SEAL was also found to be sensitive to surface adsorbates. Oxidizing O 2 or NO 2 species lead to a decrease of the SEAL, while reducing conditions are prone to enhance it.[29a,47b] Such behavior is the core of the application of In 2 O 3 and other oxide semiconductors for conductometric gas sensors.\n\nIn the past decade, similar 2DEG and downward band bending have been also observed at the surfaces of CdO, [46]\nSnO 2 ,[ 29 c, 48 ] ZnO,[ 46 b,49 ] IGZO,[ 296 ] and possibly Ga 2 O 3 ,[ 50 ] and other d-orbital metal oxides such as TiO 2 , [64] SrTiO 3 , [65] and KTaO 3 . 166 The origin of the high density of electrons are attributed to surface Vos [25b,63] and hydrogen.[49b,50,67] Thus, the SEAL\nlayers could also be tuned by intentional adsorption of oxidizing or reducing species. Recently, Santander-Syro et al. demonstrated that the thermal deposition of a monolayer of reducing metals such as Al can effectively create 2DEG in oxides such as TiO 2 , [64a] SrTiO 3 , [64a] 'ZnO, [49c] SnO 2 . [48d]\nThe general tendency of oxide semiconductors for the formation of SEAL can be understood within the context of the charge neutrality level (CNL), or the branch point energy of the semiconductor, as proposed by King et al. [472,68] The CNL is an energy level at which the surface state is electrically neutral. Its energy position relative to the Fermi level ( E f ) is the demarcation for a surface state being donor-like (higher than E f ) and acceptor-like (lower than E f ). As summarized in Figure 4, the CNLs for ZnO, CdO, In2O3, SnO2 and IGZO locate at 0.5, 0.4, 0.7, 0.6, and 0 eV above the CBM, respectively, in contrast to the conventional semiconductors such as Si and GaAs where the CNL locate within the bandgap. [296,50,68] The fundamental reason for the CNL lying above the CBM for oxide semiconductors can be understood by the relatively low energy of CBM\nformed by the low- lying metal s orbitals. Consequently, there is a tendency for the surface state to be donor-like, i.e., positively charged, which causes the accumulation of electrons near the surface region to screen it and a downward band bending.\n\nomoog +[FOC/COM] no candid online) foll W, 100 (suc\n\n![6_image_0.png](6_image_0.png)\n\nAs a rule of thumb, the tendency to form SEAL is correlated to the energy difference of CNL relative to CBM. Besides In2O3, other In-containing compounds such as InAs[69] and InN[70]\nhave been reported to have SEAL and downward band bending, because of their low-lying CBMs of mainly In 5s orbital character. On the other hand, Ga 4s has a much higher energy than In 5s. The CNL of Ga2O3 (Figure 4) is located at 0.6 eV below CBM. This may explain the observation both surface electron depletion and upward band bending in literatures.[50] The depletion of electrons at surface region of Ga2O3 lead to difficulty in achieving Ohmic contacts for Ga2O3 based electronic devices.[71]\n\n## 2.3.2. Interface 2Deg\n\nBesides surfaces, 2DEG can also be realized by engineering the band offsets and charge transfer at the heterointerfaces of two oxide semiconductors. Electrons confined by the quantum wells at the interface exhibit much higher mobilities than those in bulk, because of the suppression of deleterious scattering from ionized impurities and phonons. The highest mobility exceeding 3 × 107 cm2 V–1 s–1 has been realized in AlGaAs/\nGaAs interface.[72] This method forms the basis for many highend electronic devices, such as high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs) for high power and high frequency electronics. \n\nSimilar to the high-mobility 2DEG achieved in conventional semiconductors, recently it has been demonstrated that 2DEG created at the oxide semiconductor interfaces could also lead to outstanding mobility that enabled the observation of the fascinating integer and fractional quantum Hall effects, and the high-mobility 2DEG could also be exploited in HEMTs and other quantum devices.\n\nThe necessary condition for interface 2DEG requires that the CBM of the electron-donor semiconductor must be higher than that of the electron-acceptor semiconductor. The relative CBM positions of common oxide semiconductors can be found in Figure 4. The CBM positions can also be modulated by bandgap engineering, i.e., alloying ZnO with large bandgap MgO (MgxZn1–xO). Moreover, for oxide semiconductors, 2DEG \ncan also be realized by built-in electric fields arising from spontaneous polarization or electrostatics of the polar surfaces. \n\nRepresentative examples are polar MgxZn1–xO/ZnO[51] and LaAlO3/SrTiO3 (LAO/STO)[52] heterointerfaces. In MgxZn1-xO/\nZnO heterostructure, the mismatch in the spontaneous polarization of the two piezoelectric compounds is compensated by an accumulation of electron confined as 2DEG at the interface (**Figure** 5a,b). The 2DEG at the MgxZn1–xO/ZnO interface shows an extremely high mobility at T < 2 K, the best of which is in excess of 1 × 106 cm2 V–1 s–1,\n[51c] as displayed in Figure 5c, indicating the potential of oxide-based devices to compete with conventional semiconductors. Because of the high mobility and long mean free paths of electrons in 2DEG, interesting integer and fractional quantum Hall effects have been observed at MgxZn1–xO/ZnO interfaces (Figure 5d).[51] In the perovskite LAO/STO interface, 2DEG is initially proposed to originate from electronic reconstruction, as described by the \"polar catastrophe\" model, i.e., the polar structure of LAO with alternating \n(LaO)+ and (AlO2)\n− planes along the [001] direction leads to a monotonically increasing potential with an increasing number of LAO unit cells.[52] To avoid the potential divergence caused by the polar catastrophe, half an electron charge in one unit cell is transferred to the conduction band of STO, forming 2DEG of a sheet carrier density of n2D 3.4 × 1014 cm−2.\n\n[52a,73] Because of the presence of transition metal d orbitals, the 2DEGs at LAO/ STO and other perovskite oxides based interfaces are the hosts to a rich variety of phenomena, ranging from high mobility,[74] superconductivity[11a] to magnetism,[75] offering tremendous opportunity for design of next-generation electronic devices. However, the \"polar catastrophe\" model presumes an ideal scenario for thin film heterointerface. Several following XPS studies on the interface of LAO/STO failed to detect a built-in potential required for the \"polar catastrophe\" model.[76] It was also found that the appearance of 2DEG requires the thin film growth performed at a low oxygen partial pressure by PLD.[76c]\nThe interfaces grown by MBE, which normally have lower defect densities than those made by PLD, are insulating unless the LAO layer is deliberately made to be Al rich.[77] The formation of oxygen vacancies (Vos) at the interfaces and cation intermixing have been invoked to be responsible for the conductive interface, which were further supported by PES and DFT calcu lations.[76b,d,77,78]\nRecently, the interface 2DEG has been extensively exploited to enhance the device performance of TFTs based on ZnO/\nIn2O3 heterojunction[53] and Ga2O3 based HEMTs using modulation-doped (AlxGa1–x)2O3/Ga2O3 interfaces.[11d,54] We will further extend our discussions on recent advances of this aspect in Section 4.4.\n\n## 2.3.3. Interface 2Dhg\n\nAs the 2DEG at n-type oxide interface exhibits intriguing physical properties, its p-type counterpart, 2D hole gas (2DHG), \nhas also been attracting growing interests. 2DHG has already been reported in the interfaces of several III-V semiconductors, including GaAs/AlGaAs,[79] GaN/AlGaN,[80] and GaN/\nAlN.[81] However, the 2DHG in the oxide systems has not \n\n![7_image_0.png](7_image_0.png)\n\nbeen discovered until recently. Lee et  al.[55a] first reported the experimental observation of 2DHG in the system of SrTiO3/ LaAlO3/SrTiO3 (STO/LAO/STO). The 2DHG was found at the top (SrO)0/(AlO2)\n− interface, in coexistence with the 2DEG at the bottom interface of (LaO)+/(TiO2)\n0. Anh et  al.[55b] reported another experimental observation of 2DHG in the interface between TiO2-terminated STO and a thin amorphous FeOy layer. In general, the reports on 2DHG in oxide system remain elusive and this field still require extensive efforts from both experimentalists and theorists.\n\n## 2.4. Design Of New P-Type Oxide Semiconductors\n\nMost of the oxide semiconductors are n-type. The technological prospects of oxide electronics are greatly limited by the lacking availability of p-type ones.[7a,b] P-type oxide semiconductors in combination with n-type counterparts would enable the realization of CMOS logic circuits which are more energy efficient than unipolar devices, as well as p–n junction for UV optoelectronics. Furthermore, p-channel TFTs are more suitable to drive OLED pixels as they consist of bottom hole injection electrode structures.[82] Recent rapid progress in photovoltaics and solar water splitting also call for wide bandgap p-type layer for more efficient hole carrier collection. The development of highperformance p-type oxide semiconductor materials and their implementation in electronic devices are indispensable.\n\nThe high-performance p-type oxides are fundamentally limited by their electronic structures: the localized nature of O \n2p-derived VBM leads to large hole effective mass (hence low hole mobility) and difficulty in introducing shallow acceptors. The key strategy to mitigate this problem is to delocalize the top of VB by hybridizing O 2p orbitals with transition metal 3d orbitals, e.g., closed-shell Cu 3d10 orbitals or with post-transition metal cations with filled ns2 lone pair state.[83] After years of efforts, several types of p-type oxide semiconductors have been discovered and demonstrated in device applications. This section will briefly review the material design principle and current trend in development of new p-type oxide semiconductors. \n\nA detailed review on the materials chemistry of p-type oxide semiconductors can be found in refs. [7a,b]. Recent progress on p-channel TFTs and CMOS devices will be presented in Section 4.5.\n\n## 2.4.1. The Challenge: The Localized O 2P Vbm\n\nAs discussed above, the spherical, spatially spread s orbitals give rise to highly dispersive and delocalized CBM and facilitate low electron effective mass, high mobility, and n-type conductivity. However, O 2p derived VBM makes it a difficult task to obtain p-type oxide semiconductors, for the following reasons: i) the top of O 2p derived VB is very flat and localized, resulting in a large hole effective mass and thus low hole mobility. For example, the effective mass for hole in In2O3 is as large as 38 me.\n\n[14a] The hole carriers tend to be trapped by local lattices as small polarons, as opposed to electrons that are delocalized in the CB. ii) VBM is deep in energy, and holes can be easily compensated by defects such as VOs. Therefore, it is difficult to control the hole density via doping.\n\n## 2.4.2. Modulation Of Vb By Hybridization Of O 2P With Filled D Orbitals\n\nA strategy to mitigate this problem is to use the hybridization of O 2p orbitals with closed-shell Cu 3d10 orbitals, \n\n![8_image_0.png](8_image_0.png)\n\ni.e., \"chemical modulation of the valence band\" (CMVB) as proposed by Hosono and co-workers.[83] Because the energy level of Cu 3d10 is close to that of O 2p6, it is expected that the Cu 3d10 can form strong covalent bonding with O 2p6. This will result in creating a less-localized hole transport pathway and a smaller hole effective mass. Indeed, Cu2O has been known as a promising p-type oxide with a high Hall mobility exceeding 90 cm2 V–1 s–1.\n\n[84] Theoretical band structure calculations[85] clearly show that VB is composed of hybridized states of Cu 3d and O 2p orbitals (**Figure** 6a), and the VBM is much more dispersive. The hole effective mass measured by cyclotron resonance[86] for Cu2O was 0.58 me and calculated by DFT[85a] was as low as 0.24 me. The source of p-type carriers in Cu2O is associated with the formation of Cu vacancies (Vcu).[87]\nHowever, the bandgap of Cu2O is only 1.9–2.2 eV. The small bandgap of Cu2O was believed to be due to the strong Cu–Cu interaction in a cuprite structure: each Cu ion has 12 nextnearest Cu+ neighbors.[88] It was therefore suggested that a large bandgap can be found in ternary Cu based oxide with less Cu neighbors. Following this design rule, a series of Cu+\nbearing delafossite CuMO2 (M = Al,[83a] In,[89] Ga,[90] and Cr[91]) \nand related SrCu2O2\n[92] oxides have been identified. Although the CuMO2 have increased bandgaps, unfortunately they exhibit much lower Hall mobilities (the best of 7 cm2 V–1 s–1) \nthan that of Cu2O. Furthermore, CuMO2 has a quasi-2D crystal structure. The resultant anisotropic transport properties, structural instability, and high growth temperature also post many challenges for device integration.\n\nTherefore, the concept of CMVB has been applied to other transition metal oxides with \"quasi-closed\" shell configurations of nd6 and 3d3. This leads to the identification of a new class of p-type oxide semiconductors such as ZnM2O4 (M = Co, Rh, and Ir) spinel oxides[93] and Cr-based oxides.[94] Compared to layered Cu+-based materials, the spinel and Cr-based oxides have 3D lattice structures and are more compatible with the existing n-type materials. This is reflected by the recent discovery of perovskite p-type Sr-doped LaCrO3 (La1–xSrxCrO3).[95]\nThe perovskite structure represents an advantage for this material, because its flexible structure allows one to easily dope it. \n\nHowever, although being structurally stable and amenable to \n\n![8_image_1.png](8_image_1.png)\n\n![8_image_2.png](8_image_2.png) hole doping with high carrier concentration, these oxides still suffer from a low hole mobility of less than 1 cm2 V–1 s–1, due to the localized VBM.\n\nNiO is a well-known p-type semiconductor with wide bandgap of 3.7  eV.[96] NiO crystallizes in a stable rock-salt crystal structure, in which Ni2+ cations have a 3d8 configuration in octahedral coordination. The energy level of Ni 3d8 is close to that of an O 2p6 level. It is expected that the Ni 3d orbitals can hybridize strongly with O 2p6 orbitals, in a similar way as the electronic structures in Cu+-based oxide. The p-type conductivity in NiO is attributed to hole carriers induced by Ni vacancies (VNi) formed in oxygen-rich conditions or intentional doping by Li. However, there are debates in the literature regarding the hole mobility and conduction mechanism.[97] Two different models have been suggested for the conduction mechanism; i) conventional band-like conduction and high p-type Hall mobilities exceeding 25 cm2 V–1 s–1 have been reported even in polycrystalline NiO thin films;[98] these values are comparable with those of n-type oxide semiconductors and would hold great promise for many device applications; ii) in contrast, small polaron hopping (SPH) in which the carriers interact strongly with its surrounding lattice to form heavy polarons; the polaron conduction occurs through thermally activated hopping from one site to another and rather low hole mobilities \n(<0.1 cm2 V–1 s–1) have been be reported.[97a,d,99] Certainly, more work should be performed to resolve these discrepancies. Nevertheless, NiO is likely the most widely used p-type oxide semiconductors such as hole transport layer in solar cells, p-channel materials in TFTs and p–n heterojunction diodes. The simple and stable rock-salt structure and the ease of fabrication and doping are the advantages of NiO. Furthermore, the work functions of NiO can also be tuned over a wide range, from 3.7 to 6.7  eV by changing the surface dipoles, or the VNi and Li doping concentrations.[99,100] Interestingly, it has been recently demonstrated that doping of Cu cations in NiO can enhance the valence band dispersion via the subtle interaction between Cu 3d, Ni 3d, and O 2p, and hence improve the hole mobility and TFT device performance,[101] which certainly deserves more thorough study.\n\n \n\n![9_image_1.png](9_image_1.png)\n\n2.4.3. Modulation of VB by Hybridization of O 2p with Filled ns2 *Orbitals* Although the use of transition metal d orbitals to modulate the VB has led to the identification of many aforementioned p-type oxides, the achieved p-type mobility is still low due to the localized VBM. Only p-channel TFTs based on Cu2O[84a] and NiO[101]\nshow fair device performance. Learning from the spatially extended ns orbitals for n-type oxide semiconductors: an oxide in which VBM is made of spatially spread s orbitals would have a large hole mobility and would be a better p-type oxide semiconductor. Such electronic structures are found in oxides of heavy post-transition metals, such as Sn2+ (5s2), Pb2+ (6s2) \nand Bi3+ (6s2), because these are stable in ns2 (n ⩾ 5) pseudoclosed shell configurations. The ns2 states can interact strongly with O 2p by distorting the lattice, giving rise to a filled antibonding state with some ns orbital character at the top of the VB.[102] This situation is clearly manifested in the band structure of SnO calculated by DFT,[105a] showing a dispersive VBM \nat Γ-point (Figure  6b). The dispersive VBM results in a low hole effective mass of 2.3 me. The p-type conductivity in SnO \nis mainly attributed to the low defect formation energy of Sn vacancies (VSn). Soon after the first report on SnO p-channel TFT with a mobility of 1.4 cm2 V–1 s–1 in 2008,[103] SnO has received considerable attention.[104] TFT with excellent mobility of 10.8 cm2 V–1 s–1 has been achieved,[105] making SnO the most promising p-type oxide material in the field. However, the instability of SnO also presents significant technical challenges for thin-film synthesis and device integration.\n\nFollowing the concept of SnO, other Sn2+ and Bi3+ (6s2) \nbased oxides are certainly of interest to be investigated. For example, Sn2Nb2O7 and Sn2Ta2O7 with pyrochlore structure are compounds involving Sn2+. It has been reported Sn2Nb2O7 has a bandgap of 2.4  eV and Sn2Ta2O7 of 3.0  eV, determined by energy difference between VB maximum of Sn 5s2 state hybridized with O 2p and the CB minimum of Nb 4d or Ta 5d orbitals.[106] It is expected both have similar VB structures to SnO. Another more interesting system is BaBiO3 based perovskites.[107] Its actual structure is double perovskite Ba2Bi3+Bi5+O6 due to charge disproportionation of Bi (2Bi4+→Bi3++Bi5+).[108]\nThe top of VB is of Bi 6s2 states, which can be used to achieve high p-type mobility. More interestingly, by substitution of Bi5+ by Nb5+ and Ta5+, the bandgaps can be increased to 2.6 and 3.2  eV. Recently, Bhatia et  al.[107b] grew Ba2BiTaO6 epitaxial thin films by PLD, showing an encouraging hole mobility of 30 cm2 V–1 s–1.\n\n## 2.4.4. Beyond Metal Oxide Semiconductors: Cu Halides\n\nAlthough the concept of CMVB have successfully identified many p-type oxides, such as Cu+-based oxides (3d10), nd6 spinel oxides, Cr3+-based oxides (3d3), and Sn2+ and Bi3+ ns2 lone-pair based oxides, many of these oxides still suffer from low hole mobility or high defect density, limiting their uses as p-channel semiconductors for TFTs. Therefore, recently there has been increasing interests for search of wide bandgap p-type semiconductors beyond oxides. Among them, copper iodide (CuI) \nis receiving considerable attentions owing to its high intrinsic Hall mobility over 40 cm2 V–1 s–1, a wide bandgap of ≈3.1 eV, and the ease for thin film processes.[109]\nThe material design concept can be understood as following. \n\nThe key reason for the localized VBM in oxide semiconductors is that oxygen has a large electronegativity, and O 2p orbitals are anisotropic in shape with a small spatial spread. However, for anions with large atomic number, e.g., I−, the outermost 5p orbitals are large (>200 pm) and spatially spread, which is somehow similar to the s orbitals in n-type semiconductors. Furthermore, iodine also has a small electronegativity, which could raise energy level of the VBM facilitating hole doping. \n\nFurthermore, the I 5p6 states hybridize strongly with Cu 3d10, leading to even more extended transport pathway for holes.[110]\nIt has been shown that even in amorphous phase, CuSnI (Sn is used as an additive to suppress the crystallization of CuI) \nexhibit a considerably large Hall mobility of 9 cm2 V–1 s–1,\n[111]\nwhich is comparable to that of a-IGZO. Although TFTs based on amorphous CuSnI have not been reported yet, this study provided an alternative concept for the construction of p-type semiconductors for a wide range of applications.\n\nDespite the great promises of CuI, several issues may hinder its application in optoelectronic devices, including solution processability, instability, a high density of defects etc.[109,112] The currently reported conductivity of CuI thin films varies in a wide range from 102 to 104 S cm−1, probably due to the different levels of Cu vacancy (VCu).[113] The control over VCu in CuI is still challenging, but is crucial for the performances and stability of TFT devices. We will further extend the discussions on CuI TFTs in Section 4.5.\n\n## 3. Transparent Conducting Electrodes\n\nOxide semiconductors are most commonly used as transparent electrodes in flat panel displays, touch screen in smart phones, low-emissivity (\"low-E\") glass, and thin film solar cells. The critical requirements for transparent electrodes are high optical transparency over 80% for visible light and high conductivity over 104 S cm−1. Such requirements can be fulfilled by the degenerate doping of oxide semiconductors, e.g., Sn doped In2O3 (ITO), F doped SnO2 (FTO), and Al doped ZnO (AZO), \nto achieve high conductivity while keeping the optical transparency, i.e., transparent conducting oxide (TCO). The past few decades have witnessed the widespread applications of TCO in many cutting-edge and emerging technologies. \n\nAt present, ITO dominated the transparent electrode materials for flat panel displays and touch screens, not only due to its high conductivity and transparency, but more importantly its capability of growing into large area films (3 m × 6 m) with high uniformity and compatibility with device fabrication processing. FTO coatings on glass are widely used for \"low-E\" \nwindows to improve the energy efficiency of buildings. The demand for \"low-E\" glass (4 000 km2 per year) is further promoted by recent European and US policies that require all new buildings installing \"low-E\" windows.[114] FTO and AZO \nare also used as transparent electrodes and electron transport layers for thin film solar cells and OLED.\n\nHowever, one of the major issues is that indium is a rare element in the earth's crust. Therefore, extensive research \n\n![9_image_0.png](9_image_0.png)\n\n![10_image_0.png](10_image_0.png)\n\nefforts have been made to search for alternatives to ITO or to reduce the use of indium raw materials. Meanwhile, fast development of OLED and emerging flexible electronics also call for transparent electrodes with a higher conductivity and flexibility. This section will review recent progress and emerging concepts for designing new TCOs. Prior to this, we will start from introducing the fundamentals of the seemingly mutually exclusive properties of conductivity and transparency in TCOs.\n\nused for \"low-E\" glass coatings to prevent the loss of infrared light (heat) through windows. A higher n of 5 × 1021 cm−3 will bring the plasmon energy close to visible region. The \"optical window\" of TCO is set at short wavelengths by the bandgap being widen by Burstein-Moss shift arising from the block of the bottom of CB states and at longer wavelengths by plasmon energy, as shown in Figure 7b. The plasmon energy sets a limit for the electron concentration. There is a compromise between transparency and conductivity. Therefore, the most effective way for enhancing the performance of TCOs is to increase carrier mobility, while limit the carrier concentration.\n\n## 3.1. The Electrical And Optical Properties\n\nThe electrical conductivity (σ) is directly related to its carrier concentration (n) and carrier mobility (μ), according to the relation σ = neμ, where e is the elementary charge. μ is inversely proportional to m*, and proportional to the carrier scattering time (τ), via μ = eτ/m*. τ value depends on intrinsic factors such as phonon scattering and extrinsic factors such as ionized dopants, defects and grain boundaries determined by film preparation procedures. As shown in **Figure** 7, doping of Sn in In2O3 introduces Sn 5s orbitals with energy level just below the CBM of In2O3. The extra electrons can be easily ionized into the CBM as free carriers. With sufficient doping level, the Fermi level moves up into the CB. The oxide semiconductor becomes degenerately doped, and shows a free electron-like metallic behavior. For industrial standard ITO, about 6% Sn doping leads to a n of 2 × 1021 cm−3, together with a μ of 40 cm2 V–1 s–1, yielding a high conductivity of ≈1.2 × 104 S cm–1.\n\nHowever, high carrier concentrations adversely impact the transparency of the oxides, because of the absorption and reflection of light by the doping induced free electrons at CB. The free electrons oscillate with light electromagnetic field, forming collective plasma oscillations (plasmons). Below the plasmon energy, the material exhibits a high reflectivity. The plasmon frequency, ωp, is given by: ωε ε = ∗ ∞( ) p 2 2 0 ne m , where n is the carrier concentration, m* is the electron effective mass and ε0 is the permittivity of free space. The ωp depends on the carrier concentration. For n in the order of 1019–1020 cm−3, the plasmon energy is located within infrared region around 0.1–0.3 eV. This is actually the underlying reason why TCOs (e.g., FTO) can be \n\n## 3.2. Recent Advances In Design Of New Tcos\n\nAZO and FTO have been considered as the most promising alternatives to ITO. Thanks to the intensive research efforts in the last two decades, the transparency and conductivity of AZO and FTO have been improved to values comparable to those of ITO, except that FTO shows a lower conductivity \n(<5 × 103 S cm_1),[115,116] because of the lower electron mobility \n(<45 cm2 V–1 s–1) and self-compensation mechanism in SnO2.\n\n[117]\nBoth FTO and AZO can be grown into large-area films for mass production. However, the main issues that limit AZO and FTO \nto replace ITO are the stability and compatibility with device fabricating processing.[118] Wet chemical etching is the preferred method for producing ITO electrodes for flat-panel displays.[119]\nHowever, SnO2 is chemically inert.[115a] It is difficult to etch fine patterns in FTO film smaller than 50  μm, excluding the use of FTO for electronic device application. Nevertheless, FTO \nhas found niche applications as coatings for low-E glass,[120]\nwhich is also a fast expanding area because of the energy issue in recent years. On the other hand, AZO films can be easily etched in acid and alkaline solutions.[121] However, this property goes to the other extreme, leading to the instability issue of AZO with increased resistivity and surface degradation even in ambient conditions.[118a,c] This drawback prevents AZO films from being deployed in real applications that require long-term reliability of the devices, e.g., flat panel displays and touch screens. Alternatively, with the rise of thin films solar cells (e.g., CIGS and a-Si) in the last few years which account for 30% of the solar cell market, AZO is the highly attractive transparent \n\nelectrode material for such application, because of its low cost \n\n![11_image_0.png](11_image_0.png)\n\nand abundance.[122]\nIn addition, nonoxide transparent electrodes such as metal nanowires networks (e.g., Ag nanowires),[120b,123] carbon nanotube[124] and graphene[124c,125] also emerged as promising candidates in recent years. These new materials already exhibit comparable or even superior conductivity and transparency than ITO, and offer prospective advantages of roll-to-roll deposition and flexibility. Yet, the crucial stability issue remains to be resolved.\n\nDesign strategies for improving the performance of existing In-based TCOs are proposed in recent years. As mentioned in above section, increasing the mobility is the best way for designing high performance TCOs. Recently, Veal et al.[126] proposed and demonstrated a new doping mechanism for In2O3, yielding a higher mobility superior to ITO. In particular, heavy transition metal dopants, e.g., Mo-doped In2O3 (IMO), could provide Mo 4d donor states being resonant high in the CBM \nof In2O3, in contrast to the adverse perturbation caused by Sn 5s states in ITO, as shown in **Figure** 8. Therefore, IMO has an intrinsically lower electron mass and mobility than those of ITO. Highest mobility of 150 cm2 V–1 s–1 was achieved in IMO, \nsurpassing the best value of 80 cm2 V–1 s–1 from ITO. Therefore, to meet the same requirement as current ITO, only half amount of indium is required for IMO film, giving large savings in the materials cost. Furthermore, because both Mo and Sn are dopants with a ratio of a few percentages in In2O3, it is expected that large-area IMO films can be produced using similar processes in industry line of magnetron sputtering. Recently, the same group also demonstrated that Ta doping in SnO2 enhanced the electron mobility, based on the similar resonant doping mechanism.[127] This new insight provides a new concept to further improve the performance of In2O3-based and other TCOs. It is also of great interest to study the doping mechanism for other heavy transition metals dopants such as Zr,[128] Hf,[129] and W[130] and more importantly, to work with industry to test the possibility of large-scale production.\n\nAnother new approach is to overcome the limit of electron concentration set by plasmon frequency, based on a strong electron correlation in metallic transition metal oxides, as proposed by Zhang et  al.[131] The strong electron–electron interactions in these materials restrain the free carrier plasmon frequency in the infrared range. Although there is a decrease in carrier mobility due to the increased effective mass, the penalty can be compensated by a higher carrier concentration, leading to a higher conductivity. This concept has been verified in perovskite SrVO3 and CaVO3 epitaxial thin films by Zhang et al.[131]\nIt has been shown that despite of the high carrier concentration (2.6 × 1022 cm−3), plasma energy remains low in infrared region (<1.33  eV), and the materials demonstrate excellent performance when benchmarked against ITO. Thin films of perovskite La1–xSrxCrO3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) and La2/3Sr1/3VO3 also showed high performance as new TCO materials based on the similar mechanism.[132] Interestingly, based on the similar \n\n## ![12_Image_1.Png](12_Image_1.Png)\n\ndesign rule, it has been shown that SrNbO3 thin films[133] even exhibit a remarkable transparency of over 80% up to UV region \n(280 nm), as well as a high conductivity of 2 × 104 S cm−1. These properties make SrNbO3 an ideal UV transparent electrode for UV LED.[134]\nRecently, the fast growing flexible electronics and flexible displays has spurred further search for flexible transparent electrodes.[135] Polycrystalline ITO films deposited on flexible polyethylene terephthalate (PET) with a maximum conductivity of 1.7 × 103 S cm−1 at transparency of 80% have been fabricated and commercialized.[136] However, the strain-to-failure value for these films is only 1.5% and the film conductivity decreases by three orders of magnitude at large bending angles, because of the irreversible formation of cracks.[125a,137] As is mentioned above, transparent electrodes based on metal nanowires offer advantage of flexibility, but with the issue of low stability.[138]\nCovering the metal nanowires with a protecting layer, preferably with a conductive layer, such as graphene,[139] amorphous carbon film,[140] polymer[141] and metal oxides, is an effective way to solve the stability issues. Therefore, hybridizing metal nanowires with TCOs will take advantage of the complementary properties of two materials, offering a new route to achieve both high conductivity and flexibility. In recent years, significant progress has been made in the development of flexible transparent electrodes based on hybrid materials of metal nanowires or nanoparticles with TCOs.[142] For instance, Nguyen et al.[142b]\ndemonstrated a type of flexible transparent electrode based on Ag nanowires coated with Al doped ZnO, exhibiting much enhanced stability, of potential for industrial applications.\n\nDatta et al.[143] recently reported a novel approach to overcome the existing limitation of ITO being brittle, using ultra-thin 2D \nITO of a few atoms thick (**Figure** 9). The 2D ITO grown on flexible polyimide substrate was synthesized using low temperature liquid metal printing technique, with a transparency above 99% \nand a sheet resistance of 5.4 kΩ □−1. Remarkably, the conductivity of this 2D ITO layer decreases by less than 3.5% after bending for 3000 cycles to a radius of 2 mm. The high flexibility and the centimeter-scale synthesis of the 2D ITO hold great promise for application in flexible optoelectronic devices and are expected to be compatible with roll-to-roll processing.\n\nTo conclude this part, significant progresses have been made for the development of new TCOs or transparent electrodes, with the initial purpose of replace expensive ITO. Some of materials already exhibit the comparable or even better properties than today's best performing ITO films in terms of transparency and conductivity. However, for practical applications, feasibility for large-scale production, low-term stability and compatibility with device processing are also crucial requirements to be fulfilled. It is expected that newly developed materials will not replace the established ITO, but rather will find niche application areas or to meet new requirements from emerging technologies.\n\n## 4. Thin Film Transistors (Tfts)\n\nThe development of oxide TFTs is largely motivated by the fast-growing demands for advanced displays with super high resolution, large-area, thin thickness, and flexibility. The two dominating technologies for high-resolution displays are activematrix liquid-crystal display (AMLCD) and active-matrix OLED \n(AMOLED) with the global market size of US$ 108.7 billion and US$ 20.7 billion, respectively. The AMOLED market is predicted to experience a fast growth at a CAGR of 19.1% during 2021–2026.[144] Both AMLCD and AMQLED require TFTs with high mobility (>10 cm2 V–1 s–1) and superior on/off ratio (>107) \nto enable fast switching and efficient driving of each pixel. In the past decade, amorphous oxide semiconductors (AOSs) represented by amorphous InGaZnO (a-IGZO) have received the most attention as promising TFT channel materials among academia and industry, due to the obvious advantages of high mobility (10–40 cm2 V–1 s–1), low process temperature, and scalability. Currently, oxide TFTs are widely used in high-resolution \n(up to 8K) displays from small size mobile phones and tablets to over 80 in. large size TVs.\n\nIn spite of the great potential and broad markets for oxide TFTs, several challenges still remain to be resolved: i) A \nhigher TFT mobility is still in great demand for the development of displays with higher resolution, larger area, and higher refresh rate. The latest commercialized a-IGZO \nTFTs reached a mobility of 15 cm2 V–1 s–1, which could just meet the requirement for current 8K (7680 × 4320) display. \n\nii) Since the current a-IGZO TFTs involve relatively expensive elements, In and Ga, developing new TFTs with lowcost and abundant components is also in great concerns. iii) \nAlthough the current a-IGZO TFTs have many superiorities for displays, instability issues exist especially under illumination during TFT operation. iv) The development of p-type oxide TFTs is important for OLED and CMOS devices, but currently hindered by the lack of suitable p-type oxides for channel materials. v) The fast-growing needs for flexible electronics require flexible TFTs, placing new requirements for low-temperature solution processes.\n\nIn this section, we will first provide a brief introduction on the basics of TFTs, followed by an overview on current status and the instability issues of oxide TFTs. Then, we will review recent research progress on oxide TFTs including the design of new oxide semiconductors, novel oxide heterojunction structured TFTs for high mobility, recent advances in p-type oxide TFTs and CMOS devices, and emerging solution processes for flexible oxide TFTs.\n\n## 4.1. Tft Device Basics\n\nTFTs are three terminal field-effect devices that use a gate voltage to modulate the flow of current in a semiconductor layer placed between source and drain electrodes. Common TFT device architectures include staggered/coplanar and top-gate/\nbottom-gate structures, as shown in **Figure** 10. The important metrics used to evaluate the performance of TFTs include device mobility (μ), on/off ratio, threshold voltage (VT), turnon voltage (VON) and subthreshold swing (SS), which could be extracted from the ID–VD output curves and ID–VG transfer curves as shown in **Figure** 11, where ID is drain current, VD is drain voltage, and VG is gate voltage. Two regions are shown in these curves, the linear region when VD << VG - VT and the saturation region when VD >VG - VT.\n\n[145]\n\n![12_image_0.png](12_image_0.png)\n\n![13_image_0.png](13_image_0.png)\n\nDevice Mobility ( μ ): Device mobility is related to the efficiency of carrier transport, directly affecting the maximum I D\nand operating efficiency ( f ) of a TFT. The mobility of material is influenced by the scattering of lattice vibrations, ionized impurities and grain boundaries, etc. For device mobility of a TFT, additional scattering sources related to TFT configuration should also be considered, including the Coulombic scattering from dielectric charges and interface states, and surficial scattering due to roughness. As shown in Figure 11a, TFT mobility could be extracted through different methods, of which the commonly used ones are the field-effect mobility ( µ FE ) obtained at linear region and the saturation mobility ( μ sat ) obtained at saturation region from the transfer curves:\n\n$$\\mu_{\\mathrm{FE}}={\\frac{L}{W C_{\\infty}V_{\\mathrm{D}}}}\\cdot{\\frac{\\mathrm{d}I_{\\mathrm{D}}}{\\mathrm{d}V_{\\mathrm{G}}}}$$\n$$\\mu_{\\rm sat}=\\frac{2L}{WC_{\\rm ox}}\\cdot\\left(\\frac{{\\rm d}\\sqrt{I_{\\rm D}}}{{\\rm d}V_{\\rm G}}\\right)^{2}\\tag{1}$$\n$$\\mathrm{I}$$\n\n(1)\n\n$$\\mathrm{(2)}$$\n\nwhere W is the channel width, C ox is the specific capacitance of the gate dielectric per unit area, and L is the channel length. µ FE\nis more sensitive to the contact resistance since it is obtained at low V D . µ sat is less sensitive to contact resistance, but it is hard to give an accurate assumption on its effective length L especially for short channel devices.\n\nOn/Off Ratio : The on/off ratio is extracted from the transfer curve, defined as the maximum I D ( ION ) versus minimum ID (IOFF). ION mostly depends on the material properties of the channel semiconductors, while IOFF is related to the gate leakage current ( IG ) and the channel semiconductors. The commonly accepted benchmark for the on/off ratio is 107.\n\nThreshold Voltage (V T ): V T corresponds to the V G at which a conductive channel is formed at the dielectric/semiconductor interface. [146] For n-type TFTs, the positive V T correspond to devices operated in enhancement mode while negative V T correspond to devices in depletion mode. [147] As shown in Figure 11b, V T could be obtained from linear extrapolation of the I D - V G\nplot (linear region) or I D 1 / 2 - V G plot (saturation region). [148 Turn-On Voltage (Von): Von corresponds to the Vc at which I D starts to increase exponentially. V ON reflects the V G necessary to fully turn off the transistor.\n\nSubthreshold Swing (SS) : SS is used to measure the efficiency of the TFT turning on and off, which is related to the interface of dielectrics and semiconductor. SS is defined as the inverse of the maximum slope of the log ( ID ) - V G plot:\n\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}V_{G}}{1-\\epsilon}$$\n$$\\left.{\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}\\mathrm{d}\\mathrm{a}}}\\right|_{\\mathrm{max}}$$\n\n## S = - D Log ( I D )\n\n$$(3)$$\n\nSmall SS values could lower power consumption and ensure high speed switching. The benchmark for a desirable SS value is < 300 mV dec − 1 .\n\n![14_image_0.png](14_image_0.png)\n\n## 4.2. Historical Perspective And The State-Of-The-Art Oxide Tfts\n\nAlthough the commercialization of IGZO TFIs was less than 10 years, the exploration of oxide TFTs started a half century ago.[149] However, no significant performance was achieved until 2003, when Hofmann et al. reported fully transparent ZnO TFT\nwith high mobility of 2.5 cm 2 V 21 s −1 and on/off ratio of 10 7 [147]\nThe ZnO-TFTs show superior performance than that of a-Si:H\nbased TFTs, which were the dominating TFT backplanes for LCD displays at that time. Carcia et al. further demonstrated the room-temperature fabrication of ZnO TFT using magnetron sputtering, demonstrating the potential of large-scale production of oxide TFTs. [150] These pioneering works sparked intensive research efforts on oxide semiconductor based TFTs.\n\nOther binary oxide semiconductors including SnO 2 , In 2 O 3 and Ga 2 O 3 were also extensively explored as channel layers for TFTs. However, a diverse range of performances are reported in terms of mobilities and on/off ratios when different oxides are employed in TFTs. [151] A comparison of TFTs with different channel layer oxides was shown in Figure 12 , in which all the semiconductor layers were fabricated at O 2 % of 0.4% and finally annealed at T A = 150 °C [145,152] In2 O 3 TFTs normally show high mobility of up to 100 cm 2 V − 1 s − 1 , but low on/off ratio due to the high background electron concentrations (10 18 cm −3 ) present in In 2 O 3 . Similarly, SnO 2 TFTs show high mobility, but poor on/\noff ratio. [151a] In contrast, because Ga 2 O 3 has a large bandgap (4.8 eV) and large resistivity ( ρ > 10 8 Ω cm − 1 ), Ga 2 O 3 based TFT typically shows a poor µ FE and large V ON . Among all binary oxides, ZnO seems to be the best choice for TFTs, due to the high µ FE and on/off ratio. However, a common problem with binary oxides especially for ZnO is their tendency to form polycrystalline phases. The existence of grain boundaries and nonuniformity limit their large-area production to rival a-Si:H TFT.\n\nThe real game changers in the TFT field were the multicomponent AOSs. The idea of choosing multicomponent metal cations for AOSs was initially proposed by Hosono et al. in 1996 in the system of 2CdO:GeO 2 in an attempt to produce semiconducting devices with wider controllability and better\n\n![14_image_1.png](14_image_1.png)\n\n108 ' I N O N T A M I\n\n![15_image_0.png](15_image_0.png)\n\nstability. [153] From a crystallographic perspective, mixing two or more cations with different ionic radii and charges could effectively suppress the tendency for crystallization, thus facilitating the formation of amorphous structure.[153b] Main breakthrough in multicomponent oxides was the successful demonstration of single- crystalline IGZO TFTs by Nomura and Hosono et al. in 2003, showing a high mobility of 80 cm 2 V − 1 s − 1 and on/off ratio of 10 6 [32] In 2004, Nomura et al. further reported transparent TFTs using a-IGZO grown at room temperature on flexible polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates with an impressive mobility of 9 cm 2 V − 1 s − 1 and on/off ratio of 10 3 .[3b]\nAmorphous IGZO offers the advantages of low processing temperature, large- area uniformity and scalability, and meanwhile relatively high electron mobility. The success of a-IGZO\ncould be understood from the perspective of material design.\n\nIn 3+ , Ga 3+ , and Zn 2+ have different ionic radii and bonding characteristics with O, the elemental combination of InGaZnO\ncould result in crystallographic structure frustration and help to form amorphous structure. In a-IGZO, Ga e O bonds are much stronger than In - O and Zn - O. Therefore, the incorporation of Ga could suppress the oxygen deficiencies, and thus restrain the electron concentration to a low level (<< 10 17 cm −3 ) and greatly reduce the I OFF . However, inclusion of Ga would also lower the mobility, thus the involvement of In and Zn could help to keep a high mobility and ensure high I ON value.\n\nThe seminal work of a-IGZO TFTs unveiled the enormous potential of multicomponent AOSs TFTs toward high performance, large- scale production, and flexibility. A wide range of elemental combinations from ternary to quaternary or even quinary oxides have been explored, including Zn—Sn—O\n(ZTO), [154] Zn—In—O (ZIO), [155] In—Zn—Sn—O (IZTO), [156]\nIn-Ga-Sn-O (IGTO),[157] In-Ga-Zn-Sn-O (IGZTO).[158] At present, a-IGZO is still the most thoroughly investigated and dominant oxide TFTs in display market. The industrial application of a-IGZO TFTs began with the IGZO patent licensed to Samsung Electronics (2011) and Sharp (2012). Sharp first started production of LCD panels incorporating IGZO-TFT in 2012. [4.159] Major manufacturers including Sharp, Samsung, LG and BOE et al. are all active players in using a-IGZO TFT for the development of next generation displays. [160] Typical mobility for latest commercialized IG'ZO5 TFT is 15 cm 2 V − 1 s − 1 ,\ncapable of driving large- area (85 in.) displays with resolutions up to 8K. [5a] The industrial evolution of IGZO TFT technology and related devices are summarized in Figure 13.\n\n## 4.3. Toward Better Stability: Insights Of The Tft Bias Stress\n\na-IGZO TFTs have many advantages including high mobility, small SS values and ease of processing for large-scale production. However, one of the most critical problems to be resolved is the device instability against external light illumination and gate bias stress. [8d, 161 ] The major instability issues include negative bias illumination stress (NBIS) and positive bias stress (PBS).\n\nGreat efforts have been made to understand the mechanism of instability and origin of defects states, and accordingly to devise effective processing methods to minimize them [9a,b,d,31,162]\nNBIS refers to a negative shift of the threshold voltage when a negative gate bias is applied under light- illumination, as shown in Figure 14a. [163] The NBIS instability is the main technical issue remaining for real-world display applications, because the switching TFTs of LCD and OLED are almost always negatively biased and exposed to light during their operations, e.g.,\nback light in LCDs, pixels in OLEDs or ambient light. At present, a light shielding layer is used as a temporary solution, but additional processes for device fabrication are introduced. For a-IGZO TFTs, the NBIS instability was observed under light with photon energies of 2.3 eV, which is much lower than the bandgap of IGZO (3 eV). [162d] There is a consensus that the NBIS instability in a-IGZO TFTs is closely related to the subgap states near the VBM, as shown in Figure 14b. 19 a,b,163,164 The\n\n## Performance\n\n![15_image_1.png](15_image_1.png)\n\nbn: an701 amos8 .[1200/2011] no vardid onlin0 vol/W , diesH view\n \n\n![16_image_0.png](16_image_0.png)\n\nsubgap states have been observed by Nomura et al. using hard X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (HAXPES), with a density of up to 1020 cm−3.\n\n[9a] Note here that HAXPES is bulk sensitive due to the increased mean free path of photoelectrons excited by high energy X-rays. Comparative experiments indicated that the shift of Vth due to NBIS is correlated with the density of subgap states near the VBM.[9a,c] Therefore, the following proposed model could explain the observed NBIS instability: the subgap absorption (below 2.3 eV) is attributed to the photoexcitation of electrons in the subgap states to the CB, leaving positive holes in the subgap states. Under negative bias, the resulting positive holes in the subgap states drift to the gate/semiconductor interface, giving rise to a negative shift of the TFT VT.\n\nConsequently, reducing the subgap states is an effective method to resolve the NBIS instability. Therefore, extensive works have been devoted to identifying the microscopic origins responsible for the subgap states and devise strategies to minimize them. Several defect and impurity models have been proposed for the subgap states, including VOs, hydrogenrelated impurities, weakly bonded oxygen, and metal–metal bonds.[9b,d,164,165] However, no direct experimental evidence has thus far been reported, and this topic still remains hotly debated (as discussed in Section 2.2). Comprehensive combinations of advanced spectroscopic characterizations especially in device operation conditions, coupled with TFT device testing and theoretical calculations, are certainly needed.[8c,d,165b]\nNevertheless, many effective approaches have been adopted to reduce the NBIS and meanwhile increase the mobility and SS, including postdeposition thermal annealing in O2, atmospheric air, O2 mixed with 20% H2O and Ar, and defect passivation by hydrogen.[9d,164–166] Alternatively, Kim et al. very recently proposed that widening the optical bandgap of oxide semiconductors, i.e., keeping the photoexcitation energy of the subgap states larger than 3  eV, is an effective approach to suppress the NBIS instability to visible light.[162d] Based on this idea, a-ZnGaOx with a bangdap of 3.8 eV has been designed and the TFT shows excellent NBIS stability with no light-shielding layer required, while retaining a mobility of 9 cm2 V–1 s–1.\n\nPBS refers to a positive shift of the positive shifts of the VT\nunder positive gate bias stress. PBS in oxide TFTs causes very little changes in device mobility and SS. Because device mobility and SS are strongly correlated with defect states in channel semiconductors, it has been concluded that the PBS instability is mainly attributed to charge trapping process occurring in the gate dielectrics and/or at the interface between dielectrics and a-IGZO.[8a,161,167] In addition, for bottom gated devices, PBS may also be caused by the exposure of channel semiconductor to ambient conditions, where the surface absorption/desorption of water or gas molecules lead to charge trapping.[168] The PBS \ninstability can be effectively reduced by choosing more suitable dielectric materials and/or optimizing the processing conditions for dielectrics, and surface passivating using a proper passivation layer such as SiOx, TiOx, and AlOx.\n\n[169] It has been shown that the PBS shift of VT can spontaneously return to its original VT value after a relaxation period.[145,162a] In contrast to NBIS, light illumination has negligible effect on PBS. Therefore, PBS is usually a less significant factor limiting stability of oxide TFTs.\n\n## 4.4. New Materials And Heterojunctions For High Mobility Oxide Tfts\n\nThe a-IGZO TFT technology has already been well-established and successfully implemented in flat panel displays. However, higher TFT device mobility is extremely desired for displays with enhanced resolution, larger area and higher refresh rate. Besides, development of alternative oxide semiconductors composed of low-cost and abundant elements is also required, since the IGZO contains expensive and rare elements In \n($390 000 per ton) and Ga ($570 000 per ton).[170] New materials and device architectures for oxide TFTs are emerging in recent years. The most promising designs include Sn4+-based multicomponent oxide TFTs and oxide heterojunction TFTs.\n\n## 4.4.1. Sn4+-Based Multicomponent Oxide Tfts\n\nSn is abundant, nontoxic and much cheaper than In. Sn4+ cation also has similar electronic properties to In3+, due to \n\nthe analogous 4d105s° configuration. Thus, partial or full substitution of In for Sn could significantly lower the cost of raw materials. Moreover, Sn containing oxides also show better selectivity over etching reagents.[12,171] Therefore, in the past few years, Sn based multicomponent oxides are receiving considerable research interests for oxide TFTs, including InZnSnO (IZTO),[156] InGaSnO (IGTO)[157] and InGaZnSnO (IGZTO).[158c,d,172] Initial efforts were devoted to a-IZTO TFTs from which encouraging results have been obtained. Morosawa et  al. reported a top gated a-IZTO TFT with high mobility of 32 cm2 V–1 s–1, on/off ratio >108 and a low SS of 0.12 V per dec. along with the demonstration of driving 9.9 in. AMOLED.[173]\nCho et  al. reported the fabrication of bottom gated a-IZTO TFTs on flexible polyimide substrates, exhibiting mobility of 25.1 cm2 V–1 s–1, on/off ratio >108 and SS of 0.17 V per dec.[174]\nRecently, excellent performances were also achieved with a-IGTO and a-IGZTO TFTs. Lee et  al. reported a dual-gate a-IGTO TFT exhibiting high mobility of 39.1 cm2 V–1 s–1 and low SS of 0.19  V per dec.[157b] Interestingly, NBIS instability issue were barely observed in a-IGTO TFTs, because of the low density of subgap states. a-IGZTO TFTs were also lately reported with high mobility of 46.7 cm2 V–1 s–1, on/off ratio >1 × 108 and SS of 0.15 V per dec after treated with an annealing temperature of 300 °C.[158d]\nOverall, Sn based multicomponent oxide TFTs show superior device performance and improved stability over a-IGZO. However, the underlying mechanism for these enhanced performances and improved stability are still not clear. Further works should also be done to optimize elemental compositions and to explore the practicability for large-scale production.\n\n## 4.4.2. Heterojunction Oxide Tfts\n\nA novel construction of oxide TFTs using oxide heterojunctions are receiving increasing attentions. The motivation is to combine the advantages of both the front channel to provide high mobility and the back channel to maintain low IOFF.\n\n[175]\nThe second advantage is the creation of 2DEG at heterojunction interfaces. The interfacial 2DEG could lower the carrier scattering and improve device mobility, as shown in **Figure** 15a. In 2015, Anthopoulos et al. explored the heterojunction and quasisuperlattice TFTs based on binary oxides of In2O3, Ga2O3, and ZnO and achieved high mobilities of 25–45 cm2 V-1 s-1, about ten times larger than those from single layer TFTs.[53a] Later in 2017, the In2O3/ZnO 2DEG TFT was further optimized and obtained a high mobility of 45 cm2 V–1 s–1 and an on/off ratio of ≈107, as shown in Figure  15b,c.[53b] Lee et  al. constructed ITZO/IGZO TFTs with optimized corrugated structure, exhibited highest mobility of >50 cm2 V–1 s–1 and on/off ratio of \n≈108.\n\n[176] Superlattices of In2O3/ZnO-Li were also used to build TFTs exhibiting mobility of 25 cm2 V–1 s–1 and on/off ratio of ≈108.\n\n[177] Interestingly, these optimized multilayer TFTs often exhibited better bias-stress stability than the single-layer TFTs. Lin et  al. reported hybrid organic-metal oxide TFTs composed of solution-processed multilayers of In2O3, ZnO nanoparticles \n(NPs), insulating polymer polystyrene (PS) and compact ZnO, \nas shown in Figure 15d.[178] The incorporation of PS interlayer within the In2O3/ZnO-NP heterointerface dramatically reduced the bias instability during continuous transistor operation of 24 h under electric flux densities of 2.1 × 10−6 C cm–2, while maintaining high mobility of >50 cm2 V–1 s–1.\n\n![17_image_0.png](17_image_0.png)\n\n![17_image_1.png](17_image_1.png)\n\n## 4.5. P-Type Oxide Tfts And Cmos Devices\n\nP-type TFTs are preferred to drive OLED, since p-type TFT supplies hole current for the anode of the OLED without affecting \n\n![18_image_0.png](18_image_0.png)\n\nthe drain current in the saturation mode.[179] Moreover, p-type TFTs are indispensable for the development of CMOS technology, offering lower energy consumption, simple circuit architecture, large noise margin, and straightforward paths toward the design of analog and digital circuits.[160] However, the development of p-type TFTs still lags behind that of n-type counterparts. The currently reported mobility values for p-type oxide TFTs are generally one to two orders of magnitude lower than those of n-type TFTs, and on/off ratio is less than 105. This is due to the lack of p-type oxide semiconductors, which is fundamentally limited by the electronic structure of oxide semiconductors, as discussed in Section 2.4. This subsection will review recent advances towards high performance p-type oxide TFTs and CMOS inverters.\n\nCu2O is extensively studied as channel material for p-type oxide TFTs, owing to its high Hall mobility exceeding 100 cm2 V–1 s–1.\n\n[84b,180] However, despite extensive research efforts, Cu2O oxide TFTs usually exhibited a low transistor mobility less than 1 cm2 V–1 s–1. The poor electrical performances of Cu2O TFTs was attributed to a high density of defects at grain boundaries and at the semiconductor/dielectric interface, e.g., VOs and CuO secondary phase. Recently, several strategies are proposed to control these defects and to improve the performance and stability of Cu2O TFTs, including surface passivating,[181] and doping.[182] As shown in **Figure** 16a, Kim et al. used sputtered SiO2 as phase-controlling layer to improve the switching characteristics of p-type CuxO TFTs, achieving a low SS of 0.11  V dec–1, high on/off ratio of 2.81 × 108 with μFE of 0.75 cm2 V–1 s–1.\n\n[181b] Noh et  al. used F4TCNQ layers as molecular charge transfer dopants in the solution processed p-type CuxO TFTs and achieved mobility enhancement of over 20-fold.[182b] Further constructed CMOS inverter together with n-type IGZO TFTs reached a high gain of 50.\n\nSnO is the most promising choice among all the reported p-type oxides, due to its high hole mobility attributed to its 5s2 (Sn2+) modified VBM. Most of the p-type SnO TFTs exhibit μFE value from 1 to 6.5 cm2 V–1 s–1 and the highest value of 10.83 cm2 V–1 s–1 was reported for SnO nanowire TFTs.[183]\nMotivated by the great promises of SnO, CMOS inverters using SnO as p-type channels are also widely reported.[184] Xin et al. \n\nrecently reported CMOS inverters constructed with n-type IGZO and p-type SnO TFTs, exhibiting high gain of 142 with excellent uniformity (shown in Figure 16b).[184c] However, SnO \nis chemically unstable and susceptible to oxidation form n-type SnO2. SnO TFTs also suffer from high IOFF, leading to poor on/off ratios and high energy consumption when applied to CMOS devices.[183e] To solve this problem, aliovalent doping is proposed to decrease carrier concentration and lower IOFF. \n\nWang et al. used fluorine doping in SnO TFTs to passivate the defects and significantly reduced the carrier concentration from \n≈2 × 1019 to ≈4.3 × 1016 cm−3.\n\n[185] Hung et al. doped SnO with Y3+ to suppress the formation of SnO2 phase in SnO TFTs, decreased IOFF from 2 × 10−9 to 3 × 10−12 A µm–1.\n\n[183e]\nNiO is also the material of interest for p-type TFTs, owing to its better chemical stability compared to Cu2O and SnO. \n\nNiO TFT was firstly reported by Shimotani et al. using single crystalline NiO, exhibiting limited μFE = 1.6 × 10−4 cm2 V–1 s–1 and on/off ratio of 130.[186] Different film deposition techniques including thermal oxidization, hydrothermal, and sputtering have been applied subsequently to improve the electrical performances of NiO TFTs.[187] However, NiO TFTs often showed very low device mobilities, limited by the intrinsic hole mobility of NiO. Recently, Liu et al. doped Cu into NiO to delocalize hole transport in NiO TFTs.[188] The optimized device with 5% Cu doping exhibiting μFE = 1.53 cm2 V–1 s–1, on/off ratios of 3 × 104 at a very low synthesis temperature <150 °C.\n\nAs a consequence of the limitation of p-type oxide materials, wide bandgap p-type semiconductors other than oxides are proposed to make p-channel TFTs and CMOS devices, including the use of CuI,[189] CuSCN,[190] and chalcogenides.[191]\nCuI is a rising star among nonoxide choices due to its high mobility, high transparency and better compatibility with oxide thin films. First CuI TFT was reported by Choi et al. through inkjet printing followed by low-temperature postannealing at 150 °C.[192] Average μFE = 1.86 cm2 V–1 s–1 was exhibited but average on/off ratios had low values of 101–102. Later work by Noh et  al. reported spin-coated CuI for p-channel TFTs with mobility of 1.93 cm2 V–1 s–1 synthesized at room temperature, but on/off ratio was still very low (102).[189] Very recently, an exciting μFE over 5 cm2 V–1 s–1 together with on/off ratios of \n≈107 was achieved with Zn doped CuI TFTs fabricated via spincoating at 80  °C (Figure 16c).[112] Further integration of CMOS \ninverter together with a-IGZO TFT exhibit excellent gain value of 56. These high performances of Zn:CuI TFTs (especially the significantly reduced IOFF) was explained by the n-type dopant Zn2+ working as a hole suppressor and reduced the defects.\n\nRecently, low-temperature polycrystalline silicon and oxide \n(LTPO) devices are receiving considerable interests from both academia and industry. The idea for using LTPO is to combine great switching and off-current performance of AOS-TFT with optimal on-current performance and p-type LTPS. Apple Inc. first introduced LTPO TFTs for AMOLED and applied on the Apple Watch Series 4, as shown in Figure 16d.[193] LTPO CMOS \nTFTs with high inverter gain, wider noise margin and fast rise speed are also reported by multiple groups as well as their prototype demonstrations on low power consumption LCDs.[194]\n\n## 4.6. Solution Processed Oxide Semiconductors For Flexible Electronics\n\nFlexible electronics offer great opportunities and promises for the realization of electronic devices in wider application scenarios, including wearable sensors, electronic skins, foldable displays, and energy harvesting.[195] Currently, most investigations of oxide-based flexible electronics are focusing on flexible oxide TFTs and related applications, attributing to the successfully establishment of AOSs TFT technology in the past few years. Flexible OLED displays based on AOS TFTs have already been commercialized, used on foldable smartphone and rollable TV.[196] Other devices such as wearable sensors for health-related purposes have also been investigated in flexible and stretchable forms.[197]\nOxide semiconductor thin films for flexible TFTs can be synthesized either through physical methods or solution processes. \n\nSolution processes have several superiorities over the physical methods in terms of lower cost, high throughput and simple procedures, therefore are regarded as the practical industrial options for flexible TFTs. Most of the oxide semiconductors are amendable to solution processes by using appropriate precursors. Precursors have a wide range of choices depending on the purposes, from metal oxide powders and nitrates (used to prepare colloidal-like sol-gels),[198] to alkoxide and carboxylate materials which could facilitate the hydrolysis or condensation processes.[199] However, solution processes are largely limited to the relatively high annealing temperature (normally >350 °C)  required to achieve decent electrical performances, which limit the choice of flexible substrates, as schematic illustrated in **Figure** 17a.[6a] Therefore, further lowering processing temperature while maintaining a higher device mobility and flexibility is crucial for solution production of flexible TFTs. \n\nRecently, numerous strategies are proposed, including combustion processes, photochemical activation, high pressure annealing and plasma-assisted annealing.\n\n## 4.6.1. Photonic Processing\n\nPhotonic processing is a widely adopted strategy for the lowering of processing temperatures.[200] Photonic processing methods are favored due to the adjustable wavelengths, precise control over intensity and greatly decreased annealing time. The photonic processing could be classified into deep ultraviolet (DUV), laser and flash light according to different source types. DUV induced photochemical reactions could either help the precursors conversion to the stable metal-oxide phase, or use in combination with thermal annealing to reduce annealing temperatures, as shown in Figure 17b. Park et al. introduced DUV \nphotoannealing to realize low temperature (100  °C) deposition of oxide thin films (In2O3, IZO, IGZO). The as fabricated flexible IGZO TFTs exhibited mobility of 7 cm2 V–1 s–1 and on/off ratio of 108.\n\n[200a] Park et al. further developed a DUV irradiationwater treatment-DUV irradiation (DWD) method to passivate defects in IGZO films and acquired an improved mobility of 6.94 cm2 V–1 s–1, a high on/off ratio of >109 and enhanced gate bias stability at low temperature (<150  °C).[200c] UV treatment was also used in combination with thermal annealing. Bolat et al. reported heat-assisted DUV annealing of YAlOx dielectrics for inkjet-printed flexible IGZO TFT at 150 °C, achieving maximum gate leakage current of 10−13 A, on/off ratio of 108, and μFE = 4.3 cm2 V-1 s-1.\n\n[201]\nLaser annealing is another actively conducted photonic process. Photonic annealing with laser could enable selective processing of selected areas with high accuracy and speed. Koutsogeorgis et  al. used a KrF excimer laser (10 pulses at 300 mJ cm–2) to anneal spin-coated In2O3 TFT, reaching a high \n\n![19_image_0.png](19_image_0.png)\n\n \n\n![20_image_0.png](20_image_0.png)\n\nmobility up to 13 cm2 V–1 s–1 with a thermal budget of less than 150 °C.[200d] Chen et al. used a femtosecond laser to pattern and anneal spin-coated IZO TFT, achieved an average mobility of 9.0 cm2 V–1 s–1 with reduced thermal budget.[202] Kim et al. combined multiple pulsed light of flash white light, near-infrared \n(NIR) and DUV to initiated decomposition hydrolysis and alloy dihydroxylation processes in IGZO films, successfully formed high quality IGZO films and fabricated TFT with enhanced mobility of 7.7 cm2 V–1 s–1 and on/off ratio of 3 × 106.\n\n[200e]\n\n## 4.6.2. Combustion Processes\n\nAs shown in Figure  17c, solution combustion synthesis (SCS) uses self-energy to induce exothermic combustion reaction of the precursor solution (nitrite or organic fuel and oxidizer), which could provide additional thermal energy to the film formation and significantly reduce the temperature and duration of external heating.[188,203] The involvement of SCS in flexible TFTs could effectively lower the processing temperature and thus expand the choice of flexible substrates and lower the cost. In 2011, Marks and co-workers first introduced SCS in the spin-coating of flexible TFTs, growing typical oxide thin films (In2O3, a-ZTO, a-IZO, ITO) as low as 200 °C and reported μsat = 6.0 cm2 V–1 s–1 with an on/off ratio of 103 for flexible In2O3 TFT.[204] After their first demonstration, the SCS method was also used in other solution processes including inkjet painting,[205] spray coating,[206] blade coating,[207] electrohydrodynamic printing,[208] etc. Several exciting results have been reported with SCS methods. Yu et al. using PVP-doped In2O3 as combustion precursors, fabricated ultraflexible In2O3 TFT \nat 225  °C with mobility approaching 11 cm2 V–1 s–1 and negligible performance degradation upon bending for 100 times.[209]\nFacchetti et  al. developed a highly efficient combustion bladecoating process using fluorinated fuel as cofuel, realized ultrafast reactions and lattice condensations within 10−60 s at 200–350 °C for different channel layers (In2O3, IZO, IGZO) films and Al2O3 dielectric layers, and achieved the highest μFE = 25.2 cm2 V–1 s–1.\n\n[207]\nSCSs are also used in combination with photonic processing to further improve solution TFT fabrications. Fortunato et  al. \n\nreported far ultraviolet (FUV) annealing of combustion synthesized AlOx dielectric layers for In2O3 TFTs fabricated at 180 °C, \nshowing high mobility (6.3 cm2 V–1 s–1), low operation voltage and good stability.[210] Zhang et  al. combined SCS and DUV \ntreatment to the fabrication of p-type Li:NiOx channel layers for flexible TFTs, acquired a μFE = 1.41 cm2 V–1 s–1, on/off ratio of 105, and low SS at a low process temperature of 150  °C.[211]\nRecent work by Fortunato et  al. introduced excimer laser annealing (ELA) to the combustion synthesis of AlOx dielectric layers, enabling fast film's densification (≤ 15 min) and significantly enhanced performances.[212]\n \n\n![21_image_1.png](21_image_1.png)\n\n## 5. Conclusions And Outlook\n\nIn summary, we provide an in-depth review on the fundamental understanding of the materials physics, defect and doping chemistry of oxide semiconductors, and the recent advances and challenges on the design of new p-type oxide semiconductors, high mobility 2DEG, novel transparent electrode materials, and high-performing TFTs guided by the fundament understanding.\n\nThe great success of ITO and a-IGZO TFTs are attributed to their unique electronic properties, which was intrinsically connected with the dispersive ns-orbital derived CBM of oxides. \n\nHowever, owing to localized O 2p-derived VBM, the lack of p-type oxide materials and p-channel oxide TFTs limits many potentials of oxide semiconductors. New design principle by modulating the VBM using filled ns2 orbitals could be a feasible route towards high performance p-type oxides and devices, which has already been proved in the cases of SnO based TFTs and CMOS converters. Meanwhile, emergent nonoxide p-type wide bandgap semiconductors such as Cu halides and chalcogenides are also promising candidates for p-type TFTs and CMOS inverters along with n-type oxide TFTs.[112,189,213]\nThe 2DEG at the oxide surfaces and interfaces provide great opportunities for further improving the performance of current TFT devices, fabricating HEMTs for high frequency electronics, or designing completely new devices based on the fascinating physical properties offered by 2DEG such as extremely high mobility,[10b] large magnetoresistance,[214] and even superconductivity.[11a] The huge potential of 2DEG has also be seen in the fast development of oxide heterojunction based TFTs in last a few years, in which the 2DEG at interface substantially improved the device performances. Another encouraging trend is the change of fabrication methods for oxide 2DEG heterojunctions, from high-vacuum physical methods to simple low-temperature solution methods. Oxide 2DEG TFTs processed at low temperature still exhibited relatively high mobility and on/off ratios, showing that using 2DEG is a viable route for achieving low temperature processed flexible electronic device.\n\nThe fast-growing flexible electronics demand for low temperature, high-throughput synthesis of oxide thin films on plastic substrates using solution processing. The high annealing temperature is considered a major obstacle to the application of solution-processed oxide semiconductors on a flexible plastic substrate. Combustion synthesis and photonic annealing are the promising strategies to resolve this dilemma, as demonstrated by recently reported TFTs fabricated at low process temperatures less than 150  °C, while maintaining decent device mobilities (5–10 cm2 V–1 s–1). Future researches should focus on the further combination of these strategies with large-scale technologies, e.g., roll-to-roll processing.\n\nOur review also illustrated the indivisible relationships between fundamental research and the real-world applications. A better future of oxide optoelectronics requires combinatory efforts from both academia and industry. An excellent example of these corporations is the development of a-IGZO TFT technology, in which scientists from academia first discovered the best structure and composition of oxide TFTs, and engineers from the industry followed to develop the processes suitable for \n\n![21_image_0.png](21_image_0.png)\n\nlarge-scale production in factories. The NBIS instability is still a key issue in current a-IGZO TFT technology. The underlying mechanism is still elusive and solutions are limited. Comprehensive combinations of advanced characterizations especially in device operation conditions, coupled with TFT device testing and theoretical calculations, are certainly needed.\n\nLastly, it is worth noting that oxide semiconductors also have many other important applications in the fields, such as electron transport layers (ETLs) and hole transport layers (HTLs) in emerging perovskite solar cells.[215] Furthermore, Ga2O3 has an ultra-wide bandgap of 4.8 eV, high theoretical breakdown electric field of 8 MV cm–1, as well as the availability of large-scale single-crystal substrates. Ga2O3 is now considered as a highly potential material for next-generation high power and high frequency electronics, providing new possibilities for next-generation communication, high power energy transmission and rapid transportations.[7c]\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nK.H.L.Z. is grateful for funding support by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 21872116 and 22075232).

A-IGZO\nTFT arrays have a mobility of -6 cm2/V s, subthreshold swing (S.S.) of 0.34 V/decade, threshold voltage of 3.32 V, and drain current (Id) on/off ratio of <109 with Ioff below 1013 A. Overall these devices showed slightly different electrical characteristics as compared to the long channel devices; non-saturation of output curve at high drain-to-source voltage (Vds), negative shift of threshold voltage with increasing Vds, and the mobility reduction at high gate voltage (Vgs) were observed. The second derivative method adopting Tikhonov's regularization theory is suggested for the robust threshold voltage extraction. The temperature dependency of c-value was established after taking into consideration the impact of source/drain contact resistances. The AC bias-temperature stress was used to simulate the actual operation of active matrix liquid crystal displays (AM-LCDs). The threshold voltage shift had a dependency on the magnitude of drain bias stress, frequency, and duty cycle due to the impact ionization accelerated at high temperature. This study demonstrates that the short channel effects, source/drain contact resistances and impact ionization have to be taken into account during optimization of UHD AM-LCDs.\n\n- 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction\n\nOxide semiconductors such as an amorphous indium gallium zinc oxide (a-IGZO) have been intensively studied for past ten years especially for the application to next generation flat panel displays [1–3]. Superior characteristics of the a-IGZO thin film transistors (TFTs) as compared to the hydrogenated amorphous Si (a-Si:H) TFTs such as a high field effect mobility and transparency have increased their potential to become switching or driving transistors in next generation active matrix liquid crystal display (AM-LCD) or active matrix organic light emitting diode (AM-OLED), respectively. Today it has been already established that a-IGZO TFTs can be processed uniformly over large-size area at low temperature, and can use existing active-matrix arrays production infrastructure [4–6]. Recently, the high-end displays with the ultra-high definition (UHD > -4000  2000 pixels), large-area\n(>70 in.), and high frame rate (>240 Hz) are being introduced to realize displays with more realistic visual images [7]. To fabricate such displays, the dimension of TFTs, such as channel length and width, needs to be reduced to keep a high transmittance of pixel electrodes without any decrease of pixel aperture ratio and carrier mobility. Prior studies have focused on the electrical performance or electrical stability of TFTs with the relatively large channel width W (>100 lm) and length L (>10 lm) to avoid the short channel and source/drain contact effects. Moreover, all reports published so far on a-IGZO TFTs have focused on a single TFT\nstructures [8–12]. To our best knowledge, there is no report in open literature on electrical characteristics of the a-IGZO TFT\narrays with a short channel length used in the UHD AM-LCDs. It is important to notice that the exact understanding of the fundamental electrical properties of the a-IGZO TFT arrays with a UHD resolution is required to objectively compare the electrical behaviors of the devices manufactured under different conditions. Recent studies of a-IGZO electrical bias-temperature stability (BTS) have employed a pulsed AC gate and/or drain bias simultaneously to reflect the typical driving scheme in AM-LCDs [13–18]. However, the unipolar pulsed gate stress (e.g. 0 V to positive or negative to 0 V pulse) has been often used with the source/drain grounded.\n\nAlso the duty cycle, which is defined as the ratio of turn-on time\n(ton) to frame time (tframe), was too large (25–75%) as compared with the typical duty cycle used in AM-LCDs ranging from 0.05% to 1% depending on the display resolution and refresh rate.\n\nIn this work, we examined in details the electrical characteristics of the a-IGZO TFT arrays used in the ultra-high definition displays panel with relatively short channel dimension (W = 12 lm, L = 3 lm) and we studied the bias-temperature stability using the AC pulsed gate and drain bias-temperature stress to simulate the actual operation of the AM-LCDs.\n\n## 2. Experimental\n\nA-IGZO TFT arrays were fabricated in a well-controlled manufacturing line on the glass substrate following the similar process described in [5,7]. The TFT has a back channel etched (BCE)\ninverted staggered bottom-gate structure. The active layers were deposited by conventional sputtering technique with optimized conditions so that it has In:Ga:Zn = 1:1:1 non-stoichiometric composition. The array is composed of 100 same-structured TFTs which are connected in parallel as shown in Fig. 1. The measured total drain current (Id) was divided by 100 to obtain the average Id representing one single TFT. We verified independently that the average TFT characteristic is very similar to single TFT measured separately. In manufacturing environment, it is very important to investigate the TFT arrays rather than single TFT properties for monitoring the uniformity and quality during the manufacturing process. The channel width and length of individual TFT is about 12 lm and 3 lm, respectively.\n\nThe electrical characteristics of a-IGZO TFT arrays were measured at 0.2 V steps using an Agilent B1500A semiconductor parameter analyzer in ambient air and dark conditions. The sample temperature was regulated by a heated chuck of the probe station.\n\nThe measurements were repeated several times to acquire reproducible data. The B1500A and a HP 8114A pulse generator are connected to an HP E5250A switching matrix to measure the AC\nbias-temperature stress (AC BTS) stability [18]. An Agilent EasyExpert software routine automatically switches the E5250A between the HP 8114A for AC stressing and the B1500A for device measurement. Fig. 2 shows the AC gate pulse ranging from VGL = 5 V to VGH = +15 V and DC Vds (0/5/10 V) voltage used in this study. Since the drain voltage continuously fluctuates (e.g. from 0 V to 10 V with the center being common voltage) to supply the appropriate voltage corresponding the gray scale level, it is reasonable to set the drain-to-source voltage (Vds) at a constant DC voltage during AC BTS. The accumulated stress time is defined as the total time a gate bias (negative or positive) is applied to the gate electrode. The device stressing is interrupted at predetermined time intervals to measure the TFT transfer characteristics at stress temperature (Tst) 70 C.\n\nFig. 3(a) shows typical averaged output curve at different gate bias voltage (Vgs). The inset shows no significant current crowding at low drain-to-source voltage (Vds) close to the origin of the output Fig. 1. Schematic diagram of the 100-TFT-array used in this study.\n\nFig. 2. Schematic diagram of the pulsed gate bias and DC drain bias stress conditions used in this investigation.\n\n![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)\n\n![1_image_1.png](1_image_1.png) \n\n![1_image_2.png](1_image_2.png)\n\n## 3. Results And Discussion 3.1. Tft Electrical Characteristics\n\ncurve indicating that a good contact was formed between the Cu-based source/drain electrodes and a-IGZO. However, the drain\ncurrent (Id) at high Vds does not saturate and the non-saturation\nbecomes more significant at higher gate biases. This effect is commonly observed in a-Si:H TFT [19] and polysilicon TFT [20] as well\nas in a single a-IGZO TFT [8–11] (normally for L < 4 lm) when the\nchannel length is reduced. This non-saturation is associated with\nthe channel length modulation which accounts for the Id increase\nresulted from the shrinking channel length with the application\nof Vds in excess of the saturation drain-to-source voltage (Vdsat).\nThe degree of the channel length modulation is expressed by the\nchannel length modulation parameter k in the saturation region\nas follows [21]:\nId ¼ Idsat½1 þ kðVds  VdsatÞ; ð1Þ\nwhere $V_{\\text{d}sat}$ and $I_{\\text{d}sat}$ are the $V_{ds}$ and $I_{d}$ when the slope of output curve $\\left(\\frac{\\partial I_{d}}{\\partial I_{d}}\\right|_{V_{\\text{gs}}=\\text{const.}}\\right)$ is first matched with the experimental data.  \n:$|1+\\measuredangle(V_{\\text{dc}}-1)|$\n$V_{\\text{dsat}}$) \\] . \nThe parameter k values range from 0.037 V1 at Vgs = 5 V to 0.058 V1 at Vgs = 20 V. It is speculated that the channel length modulation effect increases with increasing Vgs for TFTs with short channels. Fig. 3(b) shows a representative averaged transfer curve at Vds of 0.1 V and 20 V. The hysteresis between positive and negative sweep is small (about 0.05 V) in the subthreshold region.\n\nNegligible hysteresis indicates that very small number of electrons were trapped at or near the gate dielectric (a-SiNx/a-SiOx bilayer)/a-IGZO interface or within the a-IGZO active channel bulk.\n\nThe on/off current ratio (Ion/Ioff) is over 109 with Ioff below 1013 A.\n\nThis low leakage current will prevent the voltage of the pixel capacitor from decreasing during the TFT off-state and during changing of the display's grayscale levels resulting in reduced power dissipation\n[3]. In general, the carrier field-effect mobility (l) and TFT threshold voltage (Vth) are extracted from the standard MOSFET Id–Vgs equation in the linear region (Vds = 0.1 V) or/and saturation region\n(Vds = 20 V) [22]:\n\n$$I_{d(\\mathrm{lin})}=\\mu C_{a x}\\frac{W}{L}(V_{\\mathrm{gs}}-V_{t h})V_{d s},$$\nL ðVgs  VthÞVds; ð2aÞ\n$$I_{d(x a t)}=\\mu C_{a x}{\\frac{W}{2L}}(V_{\\mathrm{gs}}-V_{\\mathrm{th}})^{2},$$\n2; ð2bÞ\nwhere Cox is the gate insulator capacitance per unit area, W and L\nare TFT channel width and length, respectively. As Fig. 4(a) shows the 10–90% linear method used for extraction of the field-effect mobility and threshold voltage, considerable deviation between experimental and fitted curves can be observed. Since the carrier field-effect mobility (l) extracted by the 10–90% linear method can be considered as average value, the incremental field-effect mobility (lcal) corresponding to specific Vgs should also be evaluated:\n\nlcal ¼ @Id\n$$\\epsilon\\left({\\frac{\\partial l_{d}}{\\partial V_{g}}}\\right){\\frac{L}{W C_{e\\alpha}V_{d x}}}.$$\n: ð3Þ\nAs shown in Fig. 4(b) and (c), lcal of a-IGZO TFT arrays depends on Vgs and temperature. As the temperature increases, a larger number of electrons that are thermally activated from the localized trap sites into the conduction band will contribute to a free carriers resulting in a higher mobility and smaller threshold voltage, Fig. 7\n[23].\n\nAnother important TFT parameter is the subthreshold swing\n(S.S.) that was extracted as the average of three values nearest the maximum value in the subthreshold region using the following equation:\n\n$$S.S.=\\left\\{{\\frac{d\\log(I_{d})}{d V_{g^{*}}}}\\right\\}^{-1}.$$\ndVgs  1: ð4Þ\n 69\n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)\n\n$$(2\\mathbf{a})$$\n$$(2\\mathbf{b})$$\n\nTable 1\n\nExtracted a-IGZO TFT electrical properties for different Vds using 10–90% linear\n\nmethod.\n\nVds (V) l (cm2/V s) Vth (V) S.S.

This shift can be understood by a charge sharing model and a drain induced potential barrier lowering (DIBL), in general, observed in a short channel MOSFETs [24].\n\nThe channel charges near the source/drain contacts are controlled by the electric field originating not only from the gate, but also from the source/drain electrodes. As a consequence, the portion of charges directly controlled by gate is reduced resulting in the Vth lowering at high Vds. The DIBL is 69.9 mV/V, and can be calculated by [25]\n\n$$L=\\frac{\\left|V_{\\mathrm{{th}}}|_{V_{\\mathrm{{ds(sat)}}}}-V_{\\mathrm{{th}}}|_{V_{\\mathrm{{ds(kin)}}}}\\right|}{V_{\\mathrm{{ds(sat)}}}-V_{\\mathrm{{ds(lin)}}}}\\right|.$$\n$$({\\mathfrak{H}})$$\n$${\\mathsf{D I I B L}}$$\n$$({\\mathcal{A}})$$\n: ð5Þ\nObtained DIBL value is comparable to value of the a-IGZO TFTs with L < 4 lm as shown by Baek et al. [25].\n\nExpected Ioff (Ioff/W - 1015 A/lm) change with Vds cannot be observed in our experiments since measured Ioff is limited by experimental setup.\n\nIn Fig. 4(a), the linear region Id–Vgs curve shows the non-linear behavior with Vgs. Fitting of the experimental data to Eq. (2a) is rather difficult and it will result in overestimation of Vth. Hence, the determination of Vth and mobility using the 10–90% linear method is not reliable for short channel TFT having non-linear Id–Vgs characteristics. Other methods for threshold voltage extraction must be considered. One of possible methods is the transconduction change method. It is well known that only the transconductance change method can exclude the effects of the interface state, the mobility degradation, and the parasitic resistance, and can approach the physically meaningful threshold voltage [26–28]. In former studies [26–28], the transconductance change method defined the threshold voltage as the Vgs at which the second derivative of Id to Vgs (@2Id=@V2gs) is a maximum.\n\nFig. 4(b) shows the determination of threshold voltage by the second derivative method (Vth  2.8 V). Since the second-order differentiation tends to be very noisy and obtained results can vary with the measurement conditions, we suggest extracting more stable threshold voltage using the Tikhonov's regularization theory [29].\n\nTikhonov's regularization is useful to obtain meaningful solution estimates even for ill-conditioned measurements.\n\n## Gðvþ¼Fathah Þ Aðbtb Þ Ctcþg1Athf K; Ð6Þ\n\nwhere g(V), V, f k, a, Ah, Bh, and Ch are the second derivative extracted by the regularization, Vgs, measured Id, regularization parameter, the matrix representing the second order differentiation, the identity matrix, and the matrix representing the first order differentiation, respectively.

Fig. 5(b) shows the second derivative profile extracted with the regularization parameter obtained in Fig. 5(a).\n\nIn case of a = 0, it gives us very noisy variation, preventing threshold voltage extraction. Once a is optimized (a = a*), the noises are suppressed, resulting from the subthreshold region, and smooth curve is obtained enabling robust threshold voltage determination. It should be recognized that any variation in Vth extraction will impact the calculation of other TFT parameters such as gamma (c) and K\n[30] values included in following equations:\n\n$$\\mu_{\\mathrm{cal}}=\\left({\\frac{\\partial l_{d}}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{gs}}}}\\right){\\frac{L}{W C_{\\mathrm{ax}}V_{\\mathrm{ds}}}}=K\\gamma(V_{\\mathrm{gs}}-V_{\\mathrm{th}})^{\\gamma-1}.$$\nc1: ð8Þ\nId ¼ KCox\n$$K C_{\\infty}{\\frac{W}{L}}(V_{\\mathrm{gs}}-V_{\\mathrm{th}})^{\\gamma}V_{\\mathrm{ds}}.$$\ncVds: ð9Þ\nThe c and K can be extracted from the linear fit of the log–log plot of lcal as a function of the effective gate voltage (Vgs  Vth) in Eq. (8). In other words, c is obtained from the slope, (c  1), and K is calculated from the intercept when using the following equation:\nlogðlcalÞ ¼ logðKcÞþðc  1ÞlogðVgs  VthÞ: ð10Þ\nFung et al. suggested the current ratio method to extract the Vth and c at the same time using the Eq. (9) [30]. The Vth and c are determined by selecting the best linear fit to the logarithm of following drain current ratio with minimum root mean square\n(RMS) error:\n\n![3_image_0.png](3_image_0.png)\n\n$$(11)$$\n$$\\gamma\\log\\Big({\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{gs}}-V_{\\mathrm{th}}}{V_{0}-V_{\\mathrm{th}}}}\\Big),$$\n$\\left(7\\right)$. \nlog Id\nI0\n  ¼ c log Vgs  Vth\nV0  Vth  ; ð11Þ\n$$({\\mathfrak{g}})$$\n$(\\mathfrak{g})_{\\mathfrak{g}}$\nwhere I0 is the reference drain current at Vgs = V0 and chosen to be much larger than the subthreshold current. Fig. 6 shows the extraction of Vth and c at 20 C using the current ratio method. It should be stated that this procedure is rather complicated since the least square fitting over a number of estimated Vth values have to be repeated to reach minimum RMS error. Also, when the threshold voltage shift with the temperature is close to or within the measurement resolution (0.2 V in this study), it can be difficult to extract the exact Vth.\n\nFig. 7 shows the evolution of threshold voltages with temperature extracted with four different methods, which are: (1) 10–90%\nlinear method; (2) second derivative method adopting Tikhonov's regularization; (3) current ratio method; and (4) constant Id\n(1010 A) method. The second derivative method before and after adopting Tikhonov's regularization provided similar Vth results\n(not shown). The threshold voltage extracted by the second derivative method has expected non-linear dependence on temperature\n[31].\n\nFig. 8(a) compares the Id fitting results with c and K values extracted using four different threshold voltage extraction methods. Overall both current ratio and constant Id methods do not provide satisfactory results. They fit relatively well the experimental data at low (5 V) and high Vgs (18 V) but showed the largest deviation at the intermediate Vgs (8–15 V). The 10–90% linear method results in Id shift to the right as compared to the second derivative method adopting Tikhonov's regularization. The root mean square (RMS) error of the second derivative method for above threshold and intermediate Vgs range is the smallest of four\n\n![4_image_0.png](4_image_0.png) \n\n![4_image_1.png](4_image_1.png)\n\nmethods considered in this study, as shown in Table 2. From our results, we concluded that the second derivative method is most suitable for extracting the threshold voltage of the a-IGZO TFT\narrays. Still, the observed parallel shift (DVgs) to the right needs\n\nTable 2\n\nRoot mean square errors between experimental data and the results fitted using the c and K values obtained with four different Vth extraction\n\nmethods.\n\nMethod RMS (107) (above threshold) RMS (107) (8 V < Vgs < 15 V)\n\n10–90% linear method (Fig. 4(a)) 1.483 1.011\n\nSecond derivative method using Tikhonov's regularization (Fig. 5) 1.070 0.749\n\nCurrent ratio method (Fig. 6) 1.100 0.997\n\nConstant Id method (1010 A) (Fig. 3(b)) 1.074 0.972\n\nto be explained. This difference between calculated and experimental data becomes smaller at higher temperatures as shown in Fig. 8(b). We propose to explain this shift by the reduction of effective gate voltage (Vgs  DVgs) due to source/drain contact resistances (RS/D), decreasing with the increasing temperature.\n\nAssuming that the difference between the fitting curves and experimental data is associated with the source/drain contact resistances (DVgs ¼ RS=D  Id), the RS/D decreases from 36.24 X cm2 to 6.48 X cm2 when the temperature increases from 20 C to 80 C.\n\nIt can be speculated that for the a-IGZO TFT arrays, the contact resistance decreases with the increasing temperature as it was the case for a-Si:H TFT [32]. It is noted that as the Vgs increases, DVgs increases slightly (D(DVgs) -0.18 V at 20 C) since Id is Vgs dependent (DVgs / Id / Vgs). At high temperature (80 C), DVgs change with the Vgs decreases below 0.10 V. To simplify the Id and mobility fitting, constant RS/D and effective gate voltage reduction DVgs at Id = 0.2 lA were used. Fig. 9(a) and (b), respectively, show the Id and mobility fitted with c and K extracted by taking the constant effective gate voltage reduction (about 1.4 V at 20 C) into account. The Id fitting results are not perfect and the deviation of mobility at high Vgs is relatively large. This deviation\n\n![5_image_0.png](5_image_0.png)\n\nlFE  l01\n1 þ l0 W L CoxRS=DðVgs  VthÞ\n; ð12Þ\nwhere l0 is the intrinsic mobility of the a-IGZO material. We would like to indicate that it is not possible to fit perfectly the mobility with single c and K obtained using the least square method of Eq.\n\n(8) without taking into consideration the impact of the source/drain contact resistances. The impact of this contact resistance will change with the gate bias. Fitting 2 in Fig. 9(b) shows plot for which the source/drain contact impact with the gate bias was taken into consideration; this fitting corresponds well to experimental data.\n\nFig. 10 shows the evolution of threshold voltages extracted by the second derivative method adopting Tikhonov's regularization theory and c value with increasing temperature after considering the impact of the source/drain contact resistances. The c tends to decrease as the temperature increases as it would be expected from previous studies. But, the c variation within investigated temperature range is relatively small range (0.1). The c can be described by 2(TG/T)  1 (a-Si:H TFT [33]) or by Tc/T + c0 (a-IGZO\nTFT [34]); where TG and Tc are the characteristic temperature and c0 is a fitting parameter. Characteristic temperature is associated with the density of states (DOS) of conduction band tail. The Tc and c0 can be extracted from the linear fit of c as a function of the reciprocal temperature (Tc = 150 K, c0 = 1.01). Extracted Tc value indicates a low density of conduction band tail states and is in agreement with Abe et al.'s results [34]. From our results, we can conclude that the dependency of the effective gate voltage reduction in short channel device needs to be taken into account while extracting Vth and c.\n\n$$(12)^{\\frac{1}{2}}$$\n\nFig. 11(a) and (b) shows the representative evolution of the average TFT transfer curves with the stress time at stress temperature (Tst) of 20 C and 70 C, respectively, under the condition of pulsed Vgs = 5 V to +15 V, f = 240 Hz, Vds = 10 V, and duty cycle = 0.046%. The transfer curve at 70 C shifts to the negative direction more significantly than that at 20 C, especially in the subthreshold region. In this section, for simplicity and to be consistent with other BTS studies, we define the threshold voltage (Vth) as the Vgs that induces a drain current (Id) of 1010 A, e.g. constant Id method is used for Vth extraction. The carrier mobility change with AC BTS is negligible (within 3%) within investigated stress temperature. The subthreshold swing changed from 0.58 V/dec to 0.64 V/dec at 20 C and from 0.56 V/dec to 0.75 V/dec at 70 C during AC BTS indicating very negligible thermally accelerated defect generation in the bulk and/or interface between a-IGZO and gate a-SiNx/a-SiOx dielectric. It was found in Fig. 11(c) that the transfer characteristics can be recovered to its initial state when array is kept unstressed for an extended period of time at room temperature. This recovery can be accelerated by heating. In general, this behavior can be associated with the charge trapping at the interface between channel and gate dielectric; thermally generated defects in the bulk are annihilated in a relatively short time without the electrical stress at high temperature.\n\nTo further investigate the Vth shift phenomenon by the AC\npulsed gate and drain bias stress, the effects of Vds voltage, frequency (f), and duty cycle (ton/tframe) are examined with the stress time. Fig. 12(a) shows that the Vth shifts more negatively with the stress time as the Vds voltage increases when Vgs = 5 V to +15 V,\nf = 120 Hz, duty cycle = 0.046%, and T = 70 C are used. The Vth\n\n![6_image_0.png](6_image_0.png)\n\n$$\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{th}}=\\Delta V_{0}\\left\\{1-\\exp\\left[-\\left({\\frac{t_{\\mathrm{st}}}{\\tau}}\\right)^{\\beta}\\right]\\right\\},$$\n b ( ) \" # ; ð13Þ\nwhere DV0 is the difference between stress voltage Vst(e.g. 5 V) and initial threshold voltage Vth0 (DV0 = Vst  Vth0), s represents the characteristic trapping time of carriers, and b is the stretched-exponential exponent. The extracted stretched exponential parameters (s and b),\nfor the stress conditions used in this study, are listed in Table 3. The stretched-exponential time dependence of DVth can be associated with the trapping of charges into the existing traps and/or the continuous redistribution of charges located in the gate dielectric or at the channel/dielectric interface [30,35]. The Vds voltage dependence of DVth can be explained by the electron–hole or positively charged species pairs generation at the drain side by impact ionization that is accelerated by high drain-to-source lateral electrical field and high temperature. The electron and positively charged species pairs are generated in the very short period of Vgs = +15 V under positive Vds.\n\nThe existence of increasing self-heating in the channel with the stress time and drain bias stress caused by the drain current have already been established by the thermal analysis [36–38]. The oxygen vacancies (Vo 2+) are possible candidates of positively charged species\n[39,40]. The generated electrons are swept into the drain electrode by the positive drain voltage, but positively charged species are attracted and then trapped near the channel/gate dielectric interface in the period of Vgs = 5 V which takes most of the time (toff = 8.33 ms  tframe) during each frame except for a very short positive pulse\n(e.g. at UHD 120 Hz, ton = 3.9 ls). Therefore the stretchedexponential modeling with Vst = 5 V is appropriate. The average transfer curve at Vds =0V (e.g. no impact ionization) also shifts to\n\n![6_image_1.png](6_image_1.png) \n\nthe direction of negative bias, but this is only due to pulsed AC gate bias without supplying additional trapping charges at the channel/-\ngate dielectric interface. We speculate that the Vth shift is mainly attributed to the charge trapping and can be well described by stretched-exponential model. The nearly full recovery of TFT characteristics to their initial state with negligible degradation of subthreshold swing at high temperature which may be caused by the positively charged species generated in the bulk by the impact ionization supports this speculation.\n\nTo examine the influence of the number of turn-on per one gate line [Non = frequency (f)  accumulated stress time in s (tst)] and length of turn-on time during a given stress time (tst) on the impact ionization, the effects of frequency and duty cycle on DVth were investigated. Since high frame-rate devices (e.g. 240 Hz) have very short turn-on time (e.g. -1.9 ls), it needs to be checked whether such a short time is sufficient to induce the impact ionization during the drain bias. On the other hand, if the turn-on time is extended at the same refresh rate, the influence of positive gate bias during the pulsed gate stress cannot be ignored in attracting the electrons generated by the impact ionization. As the frequency increases from 60 Hz to 240 Hz, the turn-on time (ton) per a frame decreases from 7.7 ls to 1.9 ls but the number of turn-on increases from 6  105 to 24  105 during the stress time of 10,000 s. Fig. 12(b) shows that as the frequency increases, the magnitude of DVth increases when Vgs = 5 V to +15 V, Vds = 10 V, duty cycle = 0.046%, and T = 70 C are used for AC BTS. It was found that even a short turn-on time of 1.9 ls at 240 Hz is sufficient to generate the electron–hole (or positively charged species) pairs by the impact ionization. These results are consistent with Chen et al.'s report [41]; in their study turn-on time varied from 1 ls to 100 ls and the DVth s were independent of turn-on time in the investigated range. Therefore, the negative shift of threshold voltage during AC bias-temperature stress should be carefully considered to realize a high frame-rate driving in UHD AM-LCDs.\n\nFig. 12(c) shows the effect of duty cycle on the DVth for Vgs = 5 V to +15 V, Vds = 10 V, f = 120 Hz, and T = 70 C AC BTS conditions. The increment of duty cycle at the same refresh rate can show the effect of extended positive gate bias on the electron and/or positively charged species trapping. The DVth shifts more negatively for duty cycle of 10% in comparison to 0.046%. This can be attributed to the generation of larger number of electron– hole (positively charged species) pairs over the extended period of time, e.g. from 3.9 ls to 0.83 ms at UHD 120 Hz, and/or the hole trapping at the channel/gate dielectric interface induced by a longer negative gate bias. However, when the duty cycle increases up to 25% and 50%, the DVth first shifts negatively but eventually turns to the positive direction after 4000 s. This behavior can be associated with the competitive processes between the electron trapping by a positive gate bias during an extended turn-on time and trapping of more positively charged species generated by the impact ionization during a corresponding turn-on time. When the same stress condition of 50% duty cycle is applied at Vds = 0 V, the DVth shifts positively as shown in Fig. 12(c) due to larger positive gate bias stress during AC gate pulse (VGH +15 V > VGL\n5 V). These results clearly indicate the important role of drain bias stress in generating the electron–hole pairs needed for the hole trapping at the channel/gate dielectric interface.\n\nLong channel a-IGZO TFTs have also been exhibiting the asymmetrical degradation behavior between source and drain electrodes due to the different stress voltage and temperature distribution [37,38,40,42–44]. This asymmetrical degradation between source and drain electrodes can be simply checked by confirming the difference between the forward mode and reverse mode of transfer curve before and after stress [44–46]. The forward mode of transfer curve is defined when the source-drain electrodes remain in the same position as that of the stressed condition and the reverse mode is defined when the source-drain electrodes are interchanged with respect to stressed condition. The forward and reverse mode of transfer curve of TFT arrays used in this study does not show any differences before and after stress (not shown). This symmetrical degradation behavior between source and drain electrodes is mainly associated with the charge trapping of holes which are relatively uniformly distributed in the short channel devices. Also, the temperature is more evenly distributed in short channel in comparison to long channel TFTs [38].\n\n## 4. Conclusions\n\nIn this work, the electrical characteristics and stability of the ultra-high definition a-IGZO TFT arrays were examined.\n\nCompared to the long channel length TFTs, the a-IGZO TFT arrays electrical characteristics showed short channel effects. The non-saturation of output curve at high Vds was explained by the channel length modulation caused by effective channel length reduction as the channel length decreases. The negative shift of threshold voltage in the average transfer curve with the increasing Vds was observed and is described by the drain-induced-barrier lowering (DIBL). To obtain robust and physically meaningful threshold voltage, the second derivative method adopting Tikhonov's regularization theory was introduced and compared with the other Vth extraction methods. The difference between the Id experimental and fitted data as a function of Vgs was considered as the reduction of effective gate voltage by the source/drain contact resistances. The mobility reduction at high Vgs is also believed to be associated with the source/drain contact resistances influence as the channel length decreases. The extracted c values showed only slight temperature dependency by taking into consideration the impact of source/drain contact resistances. To simulate the actual operation of AM-LCDs, the AC bias-temperature stress stability of TFT arrays was investigated. The Vth has a dependency on the magnitude of drain bias stress, frequency, and duty cycle at high temperature. The main mechanism responsible for threshold voltage shift appears to be associated with the hole trapping at the channel/gate dielectric interface over long negative gate-biased time; the electron–hole (positively charged species) pairs generated by the thermally accelerated impact ionization are at the origin of holes creation. This study showed that the electrical characteristics and stability of the UHD a-IGZO TFT arrays to be used for high frame-rate high-end displays should be thoroughly investigated. The short channel effects, source/drain contact resistances and impact ionization should be taken into consideration when optimization of pixel design for future UHD\ndisplays is performed.\n\n## Acknowledgment\n\nThis research was supported at the University of Michigan by Samsung Display Co., Ltd. under the Visiting Scholar Program 2014.\n\n## References\n\n[1] Nomura K, Ohta H, Takagi A, Kamiya T, Hirano M, Hosono H.

        "text": "# Short Time Negative Gate Voltage Pulse To Eliminate Persistent Photoconductivity In Amorphous Inzno Thin Film Transistors Changhui Fan*, Yu Xin*, Ludong Qin*, Xiaoliang Zhou*, Shengdong Zhang* ** *** *School Of Electronic And Computer Engineering, Peking University, Shenzhen, China **Institute Of Microelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China ***Active Matrix Display Beijing Engineering Research Center, Beijing, China\n\nDue to amorphous InZnO has a narrow band gap energy Eg (~2.9eV) and a higher sub-gap oxygen vacancies (Vo) \ndensity states (~1020 cm-3eV-1), amorphous InZnO thin film transistors (a-IZO TFT) has high responsivity and photo response current under light illumination [1]. However aIZO TFT shows persistent photoconductivity (PPC) even after illumination has been removed, which can last for hours to days [2]. PPC severely limits the application of a-IZO TFT \nas a photodetector. In some reports [2], this effect can be effectively eliminated by applying a positive voltage pulse to the gate, but there is a lack of systematic research on the time width and amplitude of voltage pulse signals applied to gate.\n\nIn this work, different gate voltage pulse time width and amplitude signals are investigated to eliminate PPC after light illumination in a-IZO TFT. Combining the carrier and Vo changes in the schematic of the energy band diagrams before and after illumination, a model is proposed to explain the PPC recovery mechanism assisted by the negative gate voltage pulse. By applying a negative gate voltage pulse\n(Vgs=-5V), although the energy band of IZO is still bent upward, as long as the Fermi level (EF) can be close enough to or enter the state density of ionized oxygen vacancies\n(Vo2+), during the short duration of the pulse (10ns), \ngenerating a relatively large source-drain current (Ids), the negative gate voltage pulse (Vgs=-5V) can also play a role in eliminating PPC.\n\n![0_image_2.png](0_image_2.png)\n\nFig. 1.

INTRODUCTION\nH\nIGH-VOLTAGE thin film transistors (HVTFTs) have potential applications for driving field-emitter arrays [1],\ndielectric elastomer actuators [2], ferroelectric liquid crystals [3], microelectromechanical systems (MEMSs) devices [4],\nand so on. Drain offset structure is widely used to obtain high breakdown voltage (VBD) of thin film transistors (TFTs), and HVTFTs using polysilicon [5], amorphous silicon [6], amorphous InGaZnO (a-IGZO) [7], MgZnO [8], and pentacene\n(C22H14) [9] have been reported.

Although the drain offset structure improves the breakdown voltage of TFTs, it inevitably decreases the drain current due to the high resistance induced by the offset region [12].\n\nTo compensate for the reduced drain current of HVTFTs with drain offset, the dual-gate structure consisting of a top gate (TG) and a bottom gate (BG) is proven to be an effective method to obtain higher ON-current in TFTs [13], [14], [15],\n[16]. Other advantages of the dual-gate thin film transistor are lower OFF-current due to decreased leakage current [17], enhanced device stability [18], a steeper subthreshold slope [19], and a settable threshold voltage [20], [21], [22] at the cost of an extra electrical contact in the circuit and of additional processing steps during fabrication [23]. The drain current of the TFTs operating in the dual-gate mode is larger than the arithmetic sum of the drain currents through the two individual channels obtained from single-mode operation [13].\n\nJeong et al. [14] attributed high drain currents of dual-gate poly Si thin film transistors under dual gate sweep to the high carrier concentrations at both interfaces (top gate insulator (GI)/poly Si and poly Si/BG insulator) by technology computer-aided design (TCAD) simulation.\n\nSome researchers have introduced drain offset and source offset structure into the dual-gate TFTs, to improve the switching speed by avoiding additional parasitic capacitance due to the overlap between S/D and gate [24], or investigate the effect of overlap/offset length between S/D and gate on the electrical performance of dual-gate TFTs [25], [26]. However, the high voltage breakdown mechanism of dual-gate TFTs with drain offset has not been reported.\n\nThe high current of dual-gate HVTFTs will intensify heat accumulation and possibly lower the breakdown voltage. The split-channel structure divides the whole active layer channel into several channels with gaps in parallel to increase the surface area for heat dissipation [27], [28], [29], thus, alleviating the self-heating effects of dual-gate HVTFTs. The split-channel structure effectively increases heat dissipation to improve the stabilities of TFTs under positive gate bias stress\n(PBS) and high current stress (HCS). Therefore, it is possible to introduce the split channel into dual gate HVTFT to increase the breakdown voltage. However, such devices have not been reported yet.\n\nIn this study, we fabricated the a-IGZO split-channel dualgate HVTFTs to address the ON-current issue of single-gate offset-drain HVTFT while maintaining the high breakdown voltage performance. Our results show that the dual-gate 0018-9383 © 2023 IEEE.

It is confirmed thermal breakdown is the main reason limiting the breakdown voltage of dual-gate HVTFTs, and the split-channel structure can improve heat dissipation and, thus, increase the breakdown voltage of dual-gate HVTFTs close to that of single-gate HVTFTs.\n\n## Ii. Device Structure And Tcad Simulation Of Dual-Gate Hvtft\n\nFig. 1 shows the structure of dual-gate HVTFT with drain offset. The two gates of the TFT are designated as TG and BG. We set the TG length as half of the BG length and designed dual-gate HVTFTs including left-TG HVTFTs and right-TG\nHVTFTs. The cross section images of left-TG and rightTG HVTFTs are shown in Fig. 1(a) and (b), and the top view images of left-TG and right-TG HVTFTs are shown in Fig. 1(c) and (d). The starting point of the channel is referred to as X = 0 and the length of the TG is LTG (50 µm).\n\nThe starting point of the TG is referred to as XTG, and the XTG for the left-TG and right-TG HVTFTs are 0 and 50 µm, respectively. The channel width (W) is 100 µm, the gated channel length (LG) is 100 µm, the offset length (Loffset) is 10 µm, the thickness of the active layer is 50 nm, and the insulator thickness is 400 nm. The active layer we used in this study is a-IGZO.\n\nOne common reason for TFT breakdown is the high electric field under high operation voltage. The electric field distribution is important to the breakdown characteristics of HVTFTs because a low peak electric field in the gate dielectric film favors a higher breakdown voltage [30]. To investigate the impact of the top gate on the electric field of the active layer and the gate insulator, we conducted simulations using the TCAD tool provided by Silvaco. The electric field distributions in both the active layer and gate insulator of single-gate, left-TG, and right-TG HVTFTs were simulated.\n\nIn the meantime, we also simulated the output characteristics of these devices. The results of the simulations are presented in Fig. 2(a)–(d).\n\nThe simulated output characteristics of left-TG and right-TG\nHVTFTs shown in Fig. 2(a) reveal that the dual-gate structure can increase ON-current at least by 28%. The left-TG has a more significant effect in enhancing the ON-current compared with the right-TG. In dual-gate HVTFTs, the left-TG is closer to the source electrode than the right-TG. This improves the injection of carriers from the source into the channel and thus higher ON-current can be obtained. Fig. 2(b) shows that electric field distribution in the active layer does not change with the introduction of TG, whereas Fig. 2(c) and (d)\nshow electric field distribution in the gate insulator is significantly affected by the TG. Simulated results show the peak electric field in the gate insulator reduces by 25% from 2.08 × 106 V/cm in single-gate HVTFTs to 1.58 × 106 V/cm in right-TG HVTFTs. The above simulation results clearly show that right-TG HVTFTs have the potential to obtain higher breakdown voltage than single-gate HVTFTs.\n\n## Iii. Experiment Results Of Dual-Gate Hvtfts\n\nThe dual-gate HVTFTs with drain offset were fabricated on a glass substrate using IGZO film prepared by sputtering and wet etching. 200-nm-thick molybdenum (Mo) thin film is used for the bottom gate–drain and source electrodes and 350-nmthick indium tin oxide (ITO) thin film is used for the top gate.\n\nAll the electrodes were prepared by sputtering, the BG was patterned by wet etching, and other electrodes were patterned by the lift-off method. The TG and BG insulators were SiO2 which was deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), and the electrode vias were etched by reactive ion etching (RIE). Finally, the HVTFTs were annealed at 350 ◦C for 1 h in a nitrogen atmosphere. Both left-TG and right-TG HVTFTs were fabricated, and their optical images are shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b). For comparison, single-gate\n(BG) HVTFTs were also fabricated with the same geometrical parameters.\n\nThe electrical characteristics are measured using a high-voltage semiconductor test system composed of Keithley 2657A and Keithley 2450 source meter, with\n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)\n\n![2_image_1.png](2_image_1.png)\n\nthe Keithley 237 to apply voltage to the TG. We used a multiprobe semiconductor testing system (Agilent B1500A)\nto measure the transfer characteristics under low drain bias\n(VD < 100 V).\n\nThe experimental transfer characteristics of single-gate, leftTG, and right-TG HVTFTs are shown in Fig. 4(a). As shown in Fig. 4(a), the dual-gate structure can improve the ON-current and switching characteristics of offset-drain TFTs. Furthermore, left-TG HVTFTs have superior switching characteristics with a threshold voltage of 0 V, subthreshold swing of 1.13 V/dec, and ON-current of 69.4 µA. In contrast, those parameters of single-gate HVTFTs are −2.5 V, 2.25 V/dec, and 30.1 µA, respectively. The results show that the dual-gate structure can improve the threshold voltage, subthreshold swing, and ON-current of HVTFTs. The ON-current of left-TG HVTFTs is higher than that of right-TG HVTFTs, which is consistent with the simulation results shown in Fig. 2(a).\n\nThe conductance (∂ID/∂VD) curves of single-gate and dualgate HVTFTs under the gate bias of 30 V are shown in Fig. 4(b). Fig. 4(b) shows that larger conductance can be achieved from dual-gate HVTFTs than single-gate HVTFTs.\n\nThe TG significantly increases the ON-current by forming a conducting channel under the top gate and thus increases the channel conductance. With the same TG and BG bias, leftTG has a higher channel conductance than right-TG because it is located closer to the source electrode, which improves the injection of carriers from the source into the channel.\n\nFig. 4(c) shows the breakdown voltage measurement results of HVTFTs when VBG = VTG = 30 V. The VBD of singlegate, left-TG, and right-TG HVTFTs are 630, 276, and 520 V,\nrespectively. It shows that the dual-gate structure HVTFTs have lower breakdown voltages although the ON-current is improved.\n\nSimulation results shown in Fig. 2 demonstrate the peak electric field in dual-gate HVTFTs is lower than that of singlegate HVTFTs. It implies the VBD of dual-gate HVTFTs should be higher than that of single-gate HVTFTs if we assume the electric field breakdown is the main breakdown mechanism.\n\nHowever, the experiment results show the VBD of dual-gate HVTFTs is lower than that of single-gate HVTFTs. Therefore, the breakdown of dual-gate HVTFTs seems not to be induced by a high peak electric field. We speculate thermal breakdown occurs in dual-gate HVTFTs due to the high ON-current.\n\nTo probe the breakdown mechanism of dual-gate HVTFTs, we carried out breakdown voltage measurements of HVTFTs when keeping the same ON-current of ∼20 µA. The results are shown in Fig. 4(d). With the same ON-current, the VBD\nof single-gate, left-TG, and right-TG HVTFTs are 582, 566, and 566 V, respectively. The breakdown of single-gate and dual-gate HVTFTs happened at almost the same VBD times Ion (i.e., operating power). Under the same power, the same heat is generated in the device. This experiment verified that thermal breakdown is the main reason limiting the breakdown voltage of dual-gate HVTFTs. For dual-gate HVTFTs, the heat induced by high ON-current in the channel has a more significant effect on the breakdown of dual-gate HVTFTs compared with the electric field.\n\n## Iv. Experiment Results Of Split-Channel Dual-Gate Hvtfts\n\nDual-gate HVTFTs have higher ON-current than singlegate HVTFTs, but heat accumulation due to high current will induce thermal breakdown and lower the breakdown voltage. To improve the heat dissipation and increase the breakdown voltage of dual-gate HVTFTs, we introduced the split-channel structure into dual-gate HVTFTs. We fabricated single-gate, left-TG, and right-TG HVTFTs with split-channels. Instead of a continuous channel, the split-channel devices have ten split channels of 10 µm in parallel with gaps of 5 µm between the split channels. For comparison, the HVTFT without the split-channel structure is referred to as the normal-channel structure HVTFT. The channel width does not include the gap width. Therefore, the introduction of a split-channel structure enlarges the total active region area without altering the channel width. The optical images of fabricated split-channel left-TG and right-TG HVTFTs are shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b).\n\nThe comparison of the transfer characteristics of normal-channel and split-channel left-TG, right-TG, and single-gate HVTFTs is shown in Fig. 6(a)–(c). As shown in Fig. 6(a)–(c), both split-channel single-gate and dual-gate HVTFTs exhibit similar transfer characteristics compared with their normal-channel counterparts. To assess the influence of the split-channel structure on the performance enhancement of HVTFTs, we measured the transfer characteristics of split-channel single-gate, left-TG, and right-TG dual-gate\n\n![3_image_0.png](3_image_0.png)\n\n![3_image_1.png](3_image_1.png)\n\n![3_image_2.png](3_image_2.png)\n\n![3_image_3.png](3_image_3.png)\n\nHVTFTs and the results are shown in Fig. 6(d). It shows that split-channel dual-gate HVTFTs have better-switching characteristics with closer to zero threshold voltage, smaller subthreshold swing, and higher ON-current compared with split-channel single-gate HVTFTs. This demonstrates that the split-channel structure maintains the advantages of dual-gate structure HVTFTs.\n\nFig. 7 shows the breakdown voltage measurement results of normal-channel and split-channel left-TG, right-TG, and single-gate HVTFTs. Fig. 7(a) and (b) show that the breakdown voltage of normal-channel structure left-TG and right-TG HVTFTs are 335 and 315 V, respectively. The split-channel left-TG and right-TG HVTFTs broke down at 464 and 462 V, respectively. For the single-gate HVTFT,\nthe breakdown voltages of normal-channel and split-channel devices are nearly identical as shown in Fig. 7(c). Fig. 7(d)\nsummarizes the breakdown voltage and ON-current values of normal-channel and split-channel HVTFTs with single and dual-gate structures.\n\nThe characteristics shown in Fig. 7(a)–(c) also indicated that the drain current of normal-channel HVTFTs is higher than that of split-channel HVTFTs. The decreased drain current observed in the split-channel HVTFTs can be attributed to over-etching during the split-channel TFT process, which leads to a narrower channel width than the designed value. The narrower channel width restricts the flow of charge carriers, resulting in a reduced drain current compared to normalchannel HVTFTs. The presence of multiple channels in a device may introduce more \"edge effect.\" The edge effects may also influence the drain current. The width of the split channels is about 10 µm and the charge carriers predominantly transport within the channel body rather than at the edges. Therefore, the impact of edge defect effects is minimal here.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 7(a) and (b), the breakdown voltages of split-channel dual-gate HVTFTs are apparently higher than those of normal-channel dual-gate HVTFTs. The split-channel structure potentially enhances the high voltage capability of dual-gate HVTFTs, which could be attributed to reduced current or additional surface area for heat dissipation [27],\n[28], [29].\n\nFig. 7(c) shows the breakdown voltages of single-gate HVTFTs. It is interesting to find that normal-channel and splitchannel single-gate HVTFTs have nearly identical breakdown voltages, despite their different drain currents. It demonstrates that the reduced drain current may not necessarily increase the breakdown voltage of HVTFTs. In the single-gate HVTFTs, the ON-current is significantly lower compared to that of dual-gate HVTFTs. As a result, the heat produced by the single-gate HVTFTs is lower than that of dual gate. The device can dissipate heat promptly without the need for a split-channel structure before breakdown. In our results, the electric field-induced breakdown is the dominant breakdown mechanism for single-gate HVTFTs.\n\nTable I summarizes the electrical characteristics of normal-channel and split-channel HVTFTs with single-gate and dual-gate structures. The split-channel structure maintains the advantages of dual-gate structure HVTFTs, including closer to zero threshold voltage, smaller subthreshold swing, and higher ON-current. Split-channel structure boosts the breakdown voltage of left-TG and right-TG dual-gate HVTFTs by 38% and 47%, respectively. By using a split-channel structure, the dual-gate HVTFTs have a breakdown voltage close to the single-gate HVTFTs, whereas experiment results also demonstrate the split-channel structure could not raise the VBD\nof single-gate HVTFTs. Our experiment results demonstrate that the split-channel structure effectively enhances heat dissipation, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of increased Ion on high voltage endurance caused by the dual-gate structure.\n\n## V. Conclusion\n\nThe dual-gate structure in HVTFTs enhances the ON-current but reduces the breakdown voltage compared to single-gate HVTFTs. It is confirmed that thermal breakdown induced by the high ON-current is the primary limiting factor for the breakdown voltage of dual-gate HVTFT. Introducing the split-channel structure into dual-gate HVTFTs can improve heat dissipation and thus increase the breakdown voltage of dual-gate HVTFTs. Split-channel dual-gate HVTFTs are a suitable candidate for high-voltage and high ON-current TFT.\n\nREFERENCES\n[1] X.

The lateral distribution of n0 across the channel was extracted using the paired gate-to-source voltage (VGS)-based transmission line method and the temperature-dependent transfer characteristics obtained from the TFTs with diferent *Ls. n***0 abruptly decreased with an increase in the distance from** the channel edge near the source/drain junctions; however, much smaller gradient of n0 was observed in the region near the middle of the channel. The efect of L on the Rext in the TG-SA coplanar a-IGZO \nTFT was investigated by applying the drain current-conductance method to the TFTs with various Ls. \n\nThe increase of Rext was clearly observed with an increase in L especially at low VGS**s, which was possibly** \nattributed to the enhanced carrier difusion near the source/drain junctions due to the larger gradient of the carrier concentration in the longer channel devices. Because the lateral carrier difusion and the relatively high Rext are the critical issues in the TG-SA coplanar structure-based oxide TFTs, the results in this work are expected to be useful in further improving the electrical performance and uniformity of the TG-SA coplanar structure oxide TFTs.\n\nIn the last decade, amorphous indium-gallium-zinc oxide (a-IGZO) thin-flm transistors (TFTs) have attracted considerable attention due to their advantages such as a high feld-efect mobility (μFE), a low of-current, and a small subthreshold swing1–8. In addition, the a-IGZO TFTs are fabricated at low temperatures (below 300 °C) with a good uniformity over large areas9,10. Tese excellent properties make the a-IGZO TFT a promising candidate for the backplane element of active-matrix liquid-crystal displays and active-matrix organic light-emitting diode \n(AMOLED) displays11,12. Up to now, the a-IGZO TFTs have been fabricated with several structures including a bottom-gate etch stopper structure, a bottom-gate back-channel-etch structure, and a top-gate self-aligned \n(TG-SA) coplanar structure7. Among them, the TG-SA coplanar structure has many advantages compared with bottom-gate structures, such as smaller parasitic capacitance, better channel length scalability, and better process controllability13,14. Owing to these merits, the TG-SA coplanar structure a-IGZO TFT is desirable especially for high-resolution AMOLED applications15,16. However, despite such advantages, there still remain some issues to be solved in TG-SA coplanar a-IGZO TFTs. One of them is the threshold voltage (Vth) dependence on the channel length of the device17–19. In the TG-SA coplanar a-IGZO TFTs, the source/drain extension regions are n+-doped in order to lower the source/drain series resistance (Rext). Te high-density free carriers in the source/drain extension regions difuse into the IGZO channel layer during the subsequent annealing process, which increases the carrier concentration of the channel region and shifs Vth to the negative direction especially in the short channel 1School of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Chung-Ang University, 84 Heukseok-ro, Dongjak-gu, Seoul, Korea. 2Research and Development Center, LG Display, E2 Block LG Science Park, 30, Magokjungang 10-ro, Gangseo-gu, Seoul, Korea.

Therefore, the study on the lateral carrier diffusion and R en is very important in the TG-SA coplanar a-IGZO TFTs to further improve the electrical performance and uniformity of the devices. In this work, we extracted the lateral distribution of the carrier concentration in the TG-SA coplanar a-IGZO TFTs by using the paired gate-to-source voltage (V cs )-based transmission line method (TLM) and temperature-dependent transfer characteristics data obtained from the TFTs with various channel lengths. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of channel length on the R ext of the TG-SA coplanar a-IGZO TFT using the drain current-conductance method (DCCM).\n\n## Results And Discussion\n\nFigure 1(a) depicts a cross-sectional schematic of the fabricated TG-SA coplanar a-IGZO TFTs, where the fabrication process of the TFTs is introduced in the Methods Section. Figure 1(b) shows the schematic carrier concentration plot along the channel between the source and drain in the TG-SA coplanar a-IGZO TFTs. Near the source and drain junctions, the carriers diffuse from the n + -doped source/drain extension regions to the channel region.\n\nSolid lines represent the equilibrium carrier concentration ( no ) and the dotted lines represent the V GS -induced carrier concentration at two different V GS $ ( V GS1 > V GS2 ). As can be observed in Fig. 1 (b), there are two distinct regions: one is the region where V CS -induced carrier concentration is higher than no and the other is the region where no is higher than the V GS -induced carrier concentration. The conductivity in the former region is controlled by V GS , thus this region can be considered as an effective channel region. Because the effective channel ends where the V GS -induced carrier concentration is equal to n 0 , the effective channel length ( L cg ) increases with an increase in V GS . AL is defined as the difference between the drawn channel length ( L ) and L cfr ( AL = L − L eft ). R At is the source-drain series resistance associated with all the regions outside the effective channel region.\n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)\n\nFigure 2. (a) Transfer curves of the TG-SA coplanar a-IGZO TFTs with various Ls ( W/L =4 µm/3, 4.5, 6, 10, 20 µ m) measured in the linear region ( V DS =0.1 V) ( b ) V H s obtained from the fabricated TG-SA coplanar a-IGZO\nTFTs with different Ls.\n\n..\n\nFigure 2(a) depicts the transfer curves of the TG-SA coplanar a-IGZO TFTs measured in the linear region\n(drain-to-source voltage ( V DS ) = 0.1 V). L was varied from 3 to 20 µ m, while a channel width ( W ) was fixed at 4 µ m. Figure 2(a) shows that V a shifts negatively and the on-current increases with a decrease in L . These results are consistent with those in the previous works 17–19 and more negative shift of V a , in the shorter channel TFT\nwas attributed to the higher carrier concentration in the channel region caused by the carrier diffusion from the n + -doped source/drain extension regions 17 . Figure 2(b) displays the V h s obtained from the fabricated TG-SA\ncoplanar a-IGZO TFTs with different Zs. Here, V h was determined by the intercept of the extrapolated curve with the V Gs axis in the linear-scale transfer characteristics.\n\nTo extract the lateral carrier concentration distribution near the source/drain junctions in the TG-SA coplanar a-IGZO TFTs, the paired V GS -based TLM 20 was employed. In the TG-SA coplanar TFTs, the total resistance between source and drain electrodes measured in the linear region ( R wh ) can be expressed using the following equation:\nR tot\n\nID\nP FEL\nC 1  (V GS\nAL\n+ Rext VDS/2)\n3\n\n![3_image_0.png](3_image_0.png)\n\n![3_image_1.png](3_image_1.png)\n\nwhere μFEi is the intrinsic feld-efect mobility and Ci is the gate insulator capacitance per unit area, respectively. \n\nFigure 3(a) shows the Rtot-L plot measured from the TFTs with diferent Ls (L=6, 12, 20 μm) at a given VDS of 0.1 V for various VGSs (=1 to 5 V with 0.2 V steps). Figure 3(b) is the enlarged image of the encircled area in Fig. 3(a). In the paired VGS-based TLM, ΔL and Rext at a certain VGS are extracted from the intersection of two straight lines obtained at two closely separated voltages (VGS± ΔVGS) where ΔVGS is 0.2 V in this work. Figure 4(a,b) show the ΔL and the width-normalized Rext (W·Rext) extracted as a function of VGS by using the paired VGS-based TLM. ΔL and Rext are largely modulated by VGS, which confrms the presence of the unintentionally doped regions formed by the lateral carrier difusion from the n+-doped source/drain extension regions in the fabricated TG-SA coplanar a-IGZO TFTs. Te results of Fig. 4(a) and the defnition of Lef in Fig. 1(b)\nallow the extraction of the lateral carrier concentration distribution in the unintentionally doped regions near the source/drain junctions. In the TFT, the VGS-induced channel carrier concentration (n(VGS)) can be calculated using the following equation21:\n\n## N V( ) Gs = ⋅ C V I G ( ) S T − ⋅ V Q H / T (2)\n\nwhere q and t are the electronic charge and channel thickness, respectively. As explained in Fig. 1(b), Leff\n(=L− ΔL) ends where n is equal to n0 in the TG-SA coplanar a-IGZO TFTs, therefore, ΔL is uniquely determined at a specifc value of VGS by the results of Fig. 4(a). Because both n and ΔL are obtained as a function of \n\n![4_image_0.png](4_image_0.png)\n\n..\n\nV CS , we can extract no at a specific position in the unintentionally doped regions near the source/drain junctions by matching the ∆ L/ 2 and n values calculated at every V GS . Figure 5 displays the lateral distribution of n o in the unintentionally doped regions near the source/drain junctions in the fabricated TG-SA coplanar TFT with L = 20 µ m ( V n = 1.06 V). It shows that no abruptly decreases from 1.5 × 10 18 cm − 3 to 8.2 × 10 16 cm − 3 as the distance from the edge of the channel ( ΔL /2) increases from 0.16 µ m to 1.63 µ m.\n\nThe lateral carrier concentration distribution in the channel region far from the source/drain junctions can be extracted using the temperature-dependent transfer characteristics data obtained from the TFTs with different Ls.\n\nFigure 6(a–e) show the temperature-dependent linear-mode transfer curves ( V DS = 0.1 V) of the TFTs with various Ls (L = 3, 4, 6, 12, 20 µ m) measured at low V ∞ s and Fig. 7(a–c) depict the Arrhenius plots obtained from the results in Fig. 6 (a–e) . In the disordered semiconductor-based TFTs, the energy distance between the Fermi level and conduction band edge in the flat-band condition ( F 4FB = FC − E Fg ) has been successfully extracted using the temperature-dependent transfer characteristics according to the procedure described in the previous works 22 -24 Figure 8 shows the evolution of E AFB and no extracted from the TFTs with different L s using the experimental results in Figs 6 and 7 . n o was calculated from n = n igzo · exp( − E aFB /kT )\n(3)\nwhere n 1GZO is the effective density of states at the conduction band edge in IGZO at room temperature\n(=5.0 × 10 18 cm − 3 ) 25 and k is the Boltzmann constant, respectively. Figure 8 shows that E aFB increases and n 0\n\n![5_image_0.png](5_image_0.png)\n\ndecreases, with an increase in L. Tese results are consistent with the positive shif of Vth with an increase in L observed in Fig. 2. In the TG-SA coplanar TFT, n0 is diferent depending on the distance from the edge of the channel due to the carrier difusion from the n+-doped source/drain extension regions. Considering that the carrier difusion takes place from both source and drain regions, n0 is believed to have the lowest value in the middle of the channel. Because the Vth of the laterally non-uniformly doped TFT is determined by the lowest carrier concentration in the channel region, the calculated n0s in Fig. 8 based on the results in Figs 6 and 7 can be assumed to be the n0 in the of the middle of the channel in each TFT with diferent Ls. Tese results allow us to extract the values of n0 as a function of the distance from the edge of the channel in the channel region far from the source/ drain junctions. Figure 9 shows the lateral distribution of n0 in the whole channel region of the fabricated TG-SA \ncoplanar TFT with L=20 μm.\n\nBecause the relatively higher Rext has been considered as a weakness of the TG-SA coplanar structure than the bottom gate structures in a-IGZO TFTs, the extraction of the exact values of Rext is very important in the TG-SA \ncoplanar a-IGZO TFTs to further improve the electrical performance of the devices. In this work, we investigated the efects of L on the Rext of the TG-SA coplanar a-IGZO TFT for the frst time using the DCCM. As given in Fig. 4(b), the Rext of the TG-SA coplanar a-IGZO TFT can be extracted not only by the DCCM but by the paired VGS-based TLM. However, because the Rexts are assumed to be the same in all TFTs with diferent Ls in the paired VGS-based TLM, the extracted Rext from the paired VGS-based TLM is the averaged one of the TFTs with diferent Ls. Te DCCM was developed to extract the VGS-induced source and drain series resistance (Rext,S and Rext,D) in the lightly-doped-drain metal-oxide-semiconductor feld-efect transistors26. It can extract the Rext,S and Rext,D\nseparately by using the IDs and output conductances (GDs) measured in the forward and reverse operation modes in the linear operation regime, respectively. DCCM is to form four independent equations to solve Rext,S, Rext,D, \nμFE,fwd, and μFE,rev, where μFE,fwd and μFE,rev are μFEs for the forward and reverse mode operations, respectively. \n\nEquations (4) and (5) are the two of the four equations which are for the forward mode operation and equations (6) and (7) are those for the reverse mode operation.\n\n$$I_{D}=\\mu_{F E,t w a d}\\cdot{\\frac{C_{i}\\cdot W}{L_{e f f}}}\\cdot\\left(V_{G S}^{*}-\\,V_{t h}-{\\frac{1}{2}}V_{D S}^{*}\\right)\\cdot V_{D S}^{*}\\tag{1}$$\n$$\\mathbf{l})$$\nwhere $V_{\\rm GS}^{*}=V_{\\rm GS}-I_{\\rm D}\\cdot R_{\\rm ext,S}$ and $V_{\\rm DS}^{*}=V_{\\rm DS}-I_{\\rm D}\\cdot(R_{\\rm ext,D}+R_{\\rm ext,S})$.  \nwhere ⁎ VGS=VGS−ID ·Rext,S and ⁎ VDS=VDS−ID ·(Rext,D+Rext,S).      − −   ⋅ ∂∂+    ∂ ∂ − ⋅ ∂∂    ⋅    ⁎ ⁎ ⁎ ⁎ ⁎ ⁎ G IV C W LV V V VVVVVVV 12 1 2 (5) D DDS FE fwd i effGS th DS DS DS GS DS DS DS , DS = μ ∂ ∂ = ⋅ ⋅ ⋅  where ∂ ⁎ VGS/∂VDS=−GD ·Rext,S and ∂ ⁎ VDS/∂VDS=1−GD ·(Rext,D+Rext,S). \n$$\\mathfrak{h}$$\n$$I_{D}=\\mu_{\\rm FE,rev}\\cdot\\frac{C_{i}\\cdot W}{L_{\\rm eff}}\\cdot\\left(V_{\\rm GS}^{*}-V_{\\rm th}-\\frac{1}{2}V_{\\rm DS}^{*}\\right)\\cdot V_{\\rm DS}^{*}\\tag{1}$$\n$$\\mathbf{\\ddot{\\partial}}$$\n\n$${\\mathrm{where~}}V_{G S}^{*}=V_{G S}-I_{\\mathrm{D}}\\cdot R_{\\mathrm{ext,D}}{\\mathrm{~and~}}V_{D S}^{*}=V_{\\mathrm{DS}}-I_{\\mathrm{D}}\\cdot(R_{\\mathrm{ext,D}}+R_{\\mathrm{ext,S}}).$$\n\n![6_image_0.png](6_image_0.png)\n\n![6_image_1.png](6_image_1.png)\n\nFigure 6.

Because the DCCM requires only a single device for the extraction of R ext , it can be used to investigate the effects of L on the R ext in the TG-SA coplanar a-IGZO TFTs. Figure 10 shows the W · Rext ( W · ( Rexts + Rexts )) extracted as a function of Vov in the fabricated TG-SA coplanar a-IGZO\nTFT with different L s, where V OV represents V CS − V B . For comparison, the W · R Cx extracted using the paired\n\n![7_image_0.png](7_image_0.png)\n\nµ m, ( d ) 12 µ m, and ( e ) 20 µ m).\n\n..\n\nV CS -based TLM in Fig. 4(b) is also included as an inset. The results in Fig. 10 clearly shows that the R cst is increased with an increase in L especially at low V GS . Considering that the R EA at low V GS is dominated by the unintentionally doped channel regions formed by the lateral carrier diffusion from the n + -doped source/drain extension regions near the source/drain junctions, the higher R ext in the longer channel TFTs is believed to be mainly caused by the enhanced carrier diffusion (large AL ) due to the larger gradient of the carrier concentration in the longer channel devices.\n\n8\n\n![8_image_0.png](8_image_0.png)\n\n![8_image_1.png](8_image_1.png)\n\n..\n\n![8_image_2.png](8_image_2.png)\n\n..\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this work, we examined the lateral distribution of n 0 across the channel and the effects of L on the R cx in the TG-SA coplanar a-IGZO TFTs. The lateral distribution of no across the channel was extracted using the paired V CS -based TLM near the source/drain junctions and using the temperature-dependent transfer characteristics data measured from the TFTs with different L s near the middle of the channel, respectively. no abruptly decreased from 1.5 × 10 18 cm − 3 to 8.2 × 10 16 cm − 3 at room temperature as the distance from the edge of the channel ( ΔL /2)\nincreases from 0.16 µ m to 1.63 µ m in the fabricated TG-SA coplanar TFT with L = 20 µ m. However, much smaller gradient of no was observed in the channel region far from the source/drain junctions. To examine the effect of L on the R ext in the TG-SA coplanar a-IGZO TFTs, the DCCM was employed. The R ext s were extracted from the TFTs with different Ls, which clearly showed that R est increased with an increase in L especially at low V CS . The observed phenomenon was possibly attributed to the enhanced carrier diffusion (large Δ L ) near the source/drain junctions in the long channel devices.\n\n![9_image_0.png](9_image_0.png)\n\nFigure 10. W·Rext (W·(Rext,S+Rext,D)) extracted as a function of VOV in the fabricated TG-SA coplanar a-IGZO \nTFT with diferent Ls.

A SiO2 layer was deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition as a gate insulator followed by the sequential deposition of a gate metal. Afer deposition and patterning of the gate electrode and the gate insulator, the source/drain extension regions were self-aligned to the gate and are n+-doped by being exposed to the plasma during the dry-etching process. Interlayer dielectrics were deposited and patterned for source/drain contact holes. Ten, the metal layer was sputtered and patterned to form the source/drain electrodes. Te TFTs were passivated by a SiO2 passivation layer. Finally, the devices were thermally annealed to achieve the stable and uniform electrical performances.\n\n## References\n\n1. Nomura, K. *et al*.

Introduction\n\nAMORPHOUS oxide semiconductors are of great interest as the active channel material for thin-film transistor (TFT) applications [1], [2].

It has been reported that a top-gate (TG) self-aligned (SA) configuration improves TFT performance when compared to its bottom-gate counterpart. TG SA TFT offers close-to-zero gate-to-source/drain parasitic capacitance [12]–[16]. The flat-panel display (FPD) industry is pushing for cost-effective and high-resolution patterning techniques with a high throughput in order to achieve high(er)- resolution TFT arrays, as well as to reach faster switching speeds. The fabrication of short-channel TG SA TFTs has two challenges: 1) realizing high-resolution patterning using a high-throughput method and 2) doping control of the TFT channel and source–drain electrode regions, both of which are essential for the realization of low-cost high-performance downscaled TFTs.\n\nNanoimprint lithography (NIL) is one technique capable of achieving high-resolution patterns at low cost [17], [18]. It is a contact-based process which involves a mold pressing into imprint resist. The mold can either be rigid or soft depending on the material used. Rigid molds have the advantage of high resolution but are sensitive to particle contaminants, while it is nearly impossible to make conformal contact with the substrate over a large area [19]. On the other hand, soft molds offer conformal contact, albeit with lower resolution. There have been reports on the fabrication of TG and bottom gate TFTs using rigid mold-based NIL with active channel materials ranging from a-Si, IGZO, and organic semiconductors, such as 3-hexylthiophene (P3HT) and triisopropylsilylethynyl pentacene [20]–[23]. The advantages of imprint lithography for roll-to-roll TFT manufacturing have been demonstrated by roll-to-roll realization of (metal oxide) TFTs with micrometer channel lengths [24], [25]. Substrate conformal imprint lithography (SCIL) is a cost-effective imprinting technique with the advantages of both rigid and soft molds: complete conformal contact by using a flexible hybrid polymer mold and sub-10-nm resolution [26]. SCIL has been used to pattern 3-D photonic structures, nanowire growth templates, and other structures in photovoltaic and photonic applications [27]–[30].\n\nAs a result of the reduction of the channel length in TG\nSA TFTs, the resistivity of the source/drain IGZO regions will become of increasing importance with respect to device\n\n![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)\n\nFig. 1. (a) Cross-sectional view of TG SA a-IGZO TFT. (b) Top view of a fabricated TG SA TFT with a metal gate length, LG = 450 nm.\n\ncontact resistances. The use of hydrogen to reduce the sheet conductivity of the source/drain IGZO regions has been previously reported in long-channel devices [31]–[33]. In short-channel TFTs, the control of the lateral hydrogen diffusion into the channel is critical as it can cause instabilities in the turn-on voltage (VON) [34]. Therefore, controlling the hydrogen concentration, and the \"dopant profile\" becomes more critical in submicrometer channel length TFTs.\n\nIn this paper, we demonstrate coplanar TG a-IGZO TFTs with channel lengths down to 450 nm. After the IGZO island is patterned using conventional photolithography processes, SCIL is used to pattern the gate dielectric and gate electrode in a single step. Using optimization of the hydrogen doping process, doped source/drain contact regions are formed with limited lateral diffusion in the channel region. Finally, the interlayer dielectric and source–drain metallization are formed using photolithography again. A key to retain good performance while scaling down the channel length is, thus, the imprint process and the hydrogen doping process. The TFTs exhibit a field-effect mobility ∼10 cm2·V−1·s−1, subthreshold swing (SS) ∼0.3 V/decade, and a near-zero turnon voltage. The hybrid polymer mold with its flexibility and submicrometer resolution might result in a roll-to-roll compatible fabrication process in the future. We believe that our results are an incentive for further exploration of SCIL for the fabrication of submicrometer TFTs on a larger scale.\n\nII. DEVICE FABRICATION\nFig. 1(a) shows the cross-sectional view of a TG SA a-IGZO\nTFT, and Fig. 1(b) shows the top view of a TFT with a metal gate length, LG = 450 nm, where the gate stack is patterned using SCIL. The TFTs were fabricated on a 6-in glass substrate with a process flow derived from the 350 °C\n(dual-gate) SA TFT process we described before [35], [36]. In short, first, a buffer layer was grown using plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). Next, 24-nm IGZO was sputtered, patterned using photolithography, and wet etched.\n\nSubsequently, the gate stack of 200-nm PECVD SiO2 as gate dielectric and 130-nm Mo-alloy as gate electrode were blanket deposited. SCIL was then used to pattern the gate stack using a flexible hybrid mold.\n\nThe 6-in Si master used for SCIL [Fig. 2(a)] was patterned by conventional lithography with a critical dimension CD = 0.5 μm and reactive ion etching (RIE). A triple-layered flexible polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) mold was reproduced from this master. First, a PDMS layer with a high Young's modulus (X-PDMS) was spin coated on the master and cured. Second, an intermediate PDMS with a lower Young's modulus was coated and cured, while a final layer of soft\n\n![1_image_1.png](1_image_1.png)\n\nPDMS (Sylgard-184) was poured by hand, pressed against a 200 mm×200 mm square glass and left overnight. Afterward, the master and mold were separated with the pattern from the master being replicated on to the X-PDMS layer of the mold as illustrated in Fig. 2(b).\n\nFor lithographic patterning, Sol–gel-based UV curable imprint resist (Sol–gel V5100 supplied by SCIL Nanoimprint Solutions) was used. The process was performed on an MA-6 along with a SCIL pneumatic cabinet (from Suss MicroTec).\n\nA separation gap of ∼150 μm was used to make sure that the mold and the resist were closely spaced but did not make contact, such that it was possible to accurately align the patterns on the mold with the (IGZO) patterns on the glass substrate. Once the mold containing the gate pattern was aligned, the mold was pressed against the resist sequentially. The resist was cured using 365-nm UV. Next, the mold was released and resist postbake was performed. The patterned resist for the gate stack after imprinting is shown in Fig. 2(c). After imprinting, a thin layer of imprint resist surrounding the patterned resist remains on the TFT substrate, i.e., the residual layer. The residual layer was etched using RIE. After resist patterning by imprint lithography, the gate stack was patterned using a wet etch for the gate metal and dry etch for the gate insulator. The patterned gate stack is shown in Fig. 2(d). Wet etch was chosen as defacto standard for comparison with our reference SA TFT process. Using wet etch is of clear influence for the process bias, i.e., determining the final gate stack sizing on the substrates together with the amount of photoresist mask erosion during RIE etching of the gate insulator. This effect is expected to be more pronounced for short-channel length TFTs and is discussed in the next section.\n\nIn order to realize functional TG SA IGZO TFTs, the exposed source/drain IGZO regions need to be made electrically conducting. In our previously described process flow, doping of the IGZO occurs concurrently with the SiN\nintermetal dielectric deposition, presumably due to the presence of a hydrogen plasma [34], [35]. This process, however, did not lead to good small channel devices as it resulted in TFTs with very negative VON. Optimization of the process was hampered by virtue of the limited process parameters available to concurrently realize high doping as well as a high-quality\n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)\n\nNext, an intermetal-dielectric of 200-nm PECVD SiO 2 was grown under optimized conditions. In the doped source/drain IGZO regions a carrier concentration of 3.9 × 10 19 cm − 3 was achieved, determined using Hall measurements on dedicated test structures. Processes were optimized reducing the diffusion of dopants under the patterned gate stack. To finalize the TFTs, vias were patterned in the intermetal SiO 2 using photolithography and dry etching, while 130-nm Mo-alloy source/drain electrodes were sputtered and patterned by wet etching. As a final step, a TFT postfabrication anneal was performed at a temperature of 150 °C.\n\n## Iii. C Haracterization\n\nCross-sectional SEM was performed on finished TFTs of L mask = 1 µ m, 750 nm, and 500 nm, as shown in Fig. 3 (a) - (c) . The images show the epositive slope profile of the gate metal edges typically obtained from a wet etching process. Fig. 3 ( d ) shows the determined actual TFT gate length ( LG ) versus the defined gate length on the mask design\n( L mask ). A consistent offset of ∼ 300 nm was found. This value is close to the expected value taking into account that the 130-nm-thick gate electrode is etched isotropically in a wet chemical process. The extracted (true geometrical) gate length ( LG ) is used for further TFT analysis.\n\nFig. 4(a) plots the obtained transfer characteristics for SA TFTs with channel length LG = 2.7 µ m - 450 nm.\n\nL G = 200 nm TFTs showed normally- ON behavior, which is discussed as follows. In Fig. 4(b) , the extracted performance parameters of the fabricated TFTs are shown as a function of channel length. The determined parameters of the long(er) channel TG SA a-IGZO TFTs ( LG = 2.7 µ m), i.e., fieldeffect mobility ( µ FE ) ∼ 14 cm 2 .V− 1 .s− 1 and V ON = 0.5 V,\nSS = 0.3 V/decade, are comparable to the benchmark SA\nTFTs fabricated using conventional photolithographic patterning of the SA gate stack [35]. Therefore, the results demonstrate that the combination of the particular imprint resist and SCIL patterning process steps do not negatively impact the TFT performance. Proper scaling behavior is observed.\n\nNo significant degradation in the SS is observed when L G of the imprinted TG SA a-IGZO TFTs is scaled from 2.7 µ m to 450 nm.\n\nThe linear field-effect mobility ( µ FE ) of the TFTs reduces from ~14 to ~9 cm 2 .V-l .s-l for smaller channel lengths.\n\nA series resistance of the doped IGZO source/drain regions starts to affect the total device resistance. The mobility of 9 cm 2 /Vs for the 450-nm channel length transistor, nevertheless, demonstrates the feasibility of submicrometer channel length SA TFT using SCIL without (severely) impacting the TFT channel properties.\n\nIt is noted that V ON of the imprinted TG SA a-IGZO TFTs gradually shifts toward more negative voltages with decreasing TFT channel length [ Fig. 4(b) ]. We assume that the negative\n\n![3_image_0.png](3_image_0.png)\n\ntrend in VON is a result of hydrogen diffusing laterally into the TFT channel from the source/drain regions, induced during the NH3 plasma exposure. The under diffusion of dopants into the TFT channel will effectively render the electrical channel length (LElectrical) smaller than the actual geometrical metal gate length (LG). We performed gated transfer line measurements (TLMs) to determine the electrical channel length (LElectrical) in the fabricated TFTs [37], [38]. Fig. 5 plots the measured TFT resistances at varying gate voltages VGS = 16–20 V (-VGS = 1.0 V) and VDS = 1.0 V versus the TFT geometrical channel length LG. It is observed in Fig. 5 that the linear fits for each gate voltage converge into a single point, crucially on the positive side of the gate length axis at a value -L of ∼140 nm. This indicates that the electrical channel length (LElectrical) is shorter than the geometrical gate length (LG). We assume that this apparent channel shortening is the result of the lateral diffusion of hydrogen from either side of the source or the drain electrode regions into the channel. The current optimized NH3 doping recipe, therefore, dopes the first ∼70 nm of the IGZO channel under the SA TG\nstack. This also probably explains why LG = 200 nm TFTs cannot be modulated using the current doping process.\n\n## Iv. Conclusion\n\nWe have successfully demonstrated functional TG SA\na-IGZO TFTs with a channel length as small as 450 nm. These TFTs were realized by: 1) SCIL combined with fully FPD compatible processing techniques and 2) optimizing the lateral hydrogen diffusion from the doped source/drain contact regions into the channel. The a-IGZO TFTs exhibit nearideal scaling behavior with an average field-effect mobility of ∼10 cm2·V−1·s−1, SS = ∼0.3 V/decade, and a nearzero turn-on voltage. Control of the doping and the amount of diffusion of dopants into the TFT channel have been demonstrated to be of key importance to realize submicrometer a-IGZO TFTs in addition to the lithographic patterning resolution. Based on our results, nanoimprint (SCIL) stands as a promising low-cost patterning technique for TFTs which offers high resolution combined with the advantage of large-area patterning capability with high throughput. In addition, the results provide an outlook for the use of SCIL in roll-to-roll TFT manufacturing in the future.\n\n## References\n\n[1] K. Nomura, A. Takagi, T. Kamiya, H. Ohta, M. Hirano, and H.

Introduction\n\nThe reliability of amorphous oxide semiconductor thinfilm transistors (AOS-TFTs) is vital for high-definition displays and functional electronic devices. However, drain current drop (DCD) degradation has been commonly observed in the output characteristics of TFTs with channel lengths of L<10 μm [1,2]. Here, we show that DCD is a reversible process that is closely related to reduced metaloxygen bonds and is most likely caused by destruction induced by hot electrons. Based on device theory and simulations, we propose that the DCD effect is mainly caused by hot carriers, whose velocities are inversely proportional to the drain depletion width. Therefore, DCD \nfailure could be alleviated simply by using the drain-offset structure. Experiments show that drain-offset TFTs improve DCD critical voltages (by ~130%) without sacrificing the on/off ratio. These studies provide theoretical and experimental approaches to effectively suppress DCD.\n\n## Ii. Results And Discussion\n\nFirstly, we found DCD is a reversible process. Generally, the DCD appeared in the output characteristics of the device at VD = ~28 V as shown in Fig. 1(a). The TFTs with DCD \nproblem were monitored by transfer scanning, as shown in Fig. 2(b), showing that the on-current recovers from the degraded state to the initial state. The DCD recovery was not reported previously and probably due to the intrinsic evolution in IGZO.\n\nSecondly, we concluded the mechanisms of the DCD \nprocess based on the spectrum testing. XPS was conducted to investigate the chemical states of IGZO before and after DCD as shown by Fig. 1(c) and (e). We found the oxygen vacancies (Vo) increase, which reveals that the metal-oxygen bonds might be broken during DCD. The mechanisms of DCD are summarized as below and depicted in Fig. 1(e):\nWhen TFTs are in the saturation region, hot electrons are generated by a strong electric field and collide with the IGZO lattice, mainly breaking the Zn-O bonds. The generated Zn+ \nstates and increased Vo acting as localized trap states that impeding electron transport, which leads to decreased oncurrent. When TFTs are turned off, the M-O bonds reform as the lattice relaxes, allowing DCD degradation to recover.\n\nAs to solution to the DCD, we conclude that the electrons velocities of the channel are reversely proportional to the offset length. Therefore, we propose that drain-offset TFTs could be used to alleviated the DCD through hindering the generation of hot carriers. In experiments, drain-offset TFTs were fabricated. The output characteristic curves are as shown in Fig. 1(f), where the TFT with a longer offset length \n\n![0_image_0.png](0_image_0.png) obtains a greater DCD critical drain voltage. Hence, the results validate that increasing the offset length significantly reduces DCD degradation, achieving an ~130% increase in the DCD critical voltage without sacrificing the on/off ratio. \n\nTo summarize, this present study provides theoretical and experimental methods for resolving the DCD failure of short channel TFTs in flexible electronics or the driving circuits of high definition displays.

Both linear- and saturation-regime DCSs were found to be capable of causing the self-heating degradations, including the negative shift of threshold voltage, the increase of subthreshold slope and drain current. While the linear DCS eventually forms a conductor-like channel, the saturation DCS causes an additional hot carrier (HC) effect to form a defective drain regions of high energy barrier, disconnecting the 'conductor channel' from the drain side. \n\n## Author Keywords\n\nAmorphous oxide semiconductor (AOS), indium-galliumzinc oxide (IGZO), thin-film transistor (TFT), dynamic current stress (DCS), self-heating (SH), hot carrier (HC).\n\n## Introduction\n\nAmorphous oxide semiconductor (AOS) thin-film transistors (TFTs), such as a-InGaZnO (a-IGZO) TFT, have attracted extensive attention, due to high mobility, lowfabrication temperature and excellent uniformity [1]. \n\nRecently, the large current-driving capability of AOS TFTs have been increasingly demanded by various applications, such as gate-driver-on-array (GOA) circuits [2] and TFT backplanes for Micro-LED displays [3]. The AOS TFTs are well known to degrade under various gate-bias stresses, as represented by the positive and /or negative threshold voltage (Vth) shifts (ΔVth) under positive bias temperature stress (PBTS) [4] and negative bias illumination stress \n(NBIS) [5]. Even more severe degradations could occur when the AOS TFTs suffer from the high drain current (ID)\nstresses under high gate bias (VG) and drain bias (VD) [6].\n\nIn this work, the instabilities of top-gate self-aligned \n(TGSA) a-IGZO TFTs under dynamic current stresses (DCSs) were systemically investigated. The stress conditions of pulsed VG and constant VD were respectively applied to mimic the transistor operation conditions in practical display panels. Under the linear- and saturation-regime DCSs, the aIGZO TFTs exhibited distinct degradation behaviors. The underlying mechanism was clarified.\n\n## Device Fabrication\n\nThe TGSA a-IGZO TFTs with silicon nitride passivation layer (PL) were fabricated in this work, with the main process flows listed as follows. Firstly, a 40-nm-thick a-IGZO film was deposited on the glass substrates by DC \nmagnetron sputtering and patterned to form active islands by wet etch. After the samples were treated by nitrous oxide \n(N2O) plasma at 150 ℃ in a plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) chamber, the 200-nm-thick silicon oxide layer was deposited by PECVD as gate insulator (GI). Then, the samples were annealed at 300 ℃ in O2 for 90 min, followed by sputtering of the 100-nm-thick molybdenum (Mo) as the gate metal. The gate Mo and GI \nwere then etched to pattern the gate stack. After that, the samples were annealed at 300 ℃ in O2 for 30 min, and then the S/D regions of a-IGZO were treated by argon (Ar) plasma to perform S/D doping. Next, the S/D contact electrodes of Mo were formed by lift-off process. Finally, the 200-nmthick silicon nitride PL was deposited by PECVD at 150 ℃. \n\n![0_image_0.png](0_image_0.png)\n\nTFTs measured at VGs of (a) 30 V and (b) 20V, \nrespectively exhibiting the breakdown failures in linear and saturation regimes.\n\nFig. 1 shows the ID versus VD output curves of the SATG \na-IGZO TFTs measured at high VGs of 30 V and 20 V. Along with the increasing of high ID during the VD sweeping, both a-IGZO transistors encountered the current collapse, while the breakdown failures respectively occurred in the linear and saturation regimes in Fig. 1(a) and (b). Both kinds of current collapses seem to be triggered by a similar current overshoot process, which is alike with previous reports [6]. \n\nThe power before the ID overshoot is around 22 mW in both cases and higher than the reported triggering power of self-heating (SH) effect [7], confirming the origin of the current overshoot as the SH degradation. However, the ID\neventually collapsed to around 1.0×10−5 A or 6.3×10−7 A \nafter the linear- or saturation-regime breakdown, suggesting distinct underlying mechanisms besides SH effect. In order to evaluate the current failure risks of a-IGZO TFTs in practical applications, the instabilities of TGSA a-IGZO TFTs under dynamic current stresses were further investigated by biasing the transistors in linear and saturation regimes. \n\nA typical linear-regime DCS was performed with a constant VD of 21 V and VG pulse ranging from 0 t o 24 V, as illustrated in the Inset of Fig. 2. The effec tive stress time (teff) was defined as the accumulated d uration of the VG peak time (tp). As shown in Fig. 2, along with the increasing teff, the ID versus VG transfer c urve encountered a slightly positive shift during the fir st 50-sec teff (Stage I), then gradually shifted towards negative VG along with the subthreshold slope (SS) deg radation (Stage II), and finally deteriorated into a 'con ductor' (Stage III). This clearly suggests the alternation of degradation mechanisms. In contrast, the a-IGZO TF T directly degraded into a 'conductor' after several sec onds of near-regime DC stress, corresponding to only Stage-III degradation. \n\n![1_image_1.png](1_image_1.png)\n\nⅡ Ⅰ:\n\n![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)\n\nThe short-term Stage I is identical to the typical PBTS degradation with a positive ΔVth, originating from t he trapping of channel electrons into GI [4]. In Stage II,\nthe negative ΔVt h and poorer SS suggests the associated increasing of channel carriers concentration and defect density. Considering the power during VG peak is higher than the reported SH-triggering power [7], both channe l donors and defects are most plausibly generated by the SH effect. As clarified in our previous work [8], the SHE effect can turn the deep-state oxygen vacancy (Vo) defect into shallow-donor Vo, as illustrated in Fig. 3(a). The gradually accelerated ΔVth with the teff increase corresponds to the heat accumulation process in the a-IGZO channel of poor thermal conductivity.\n\nThese SH-induced donor defects raises the ID, and in turn increases the SH power and thus the channel te mperature, triggering a positive feedback loop in Fig. 3(b). After the considerably accelerated generation proc ess of donors, especially in the channel center, the cen tral a-IGZO channel eventually degenerates into a cond uctor, corresponding to the photo of breakdown a-IGZ O TFT in Fig. 3(c). As pointed out by the superimpos ed equivalent circuit, the side channels will be bypasse d by the center 'conductor-like' channel, causing the S\ntage III behavior. This is also in accurate accordance with the still high ID after the linear-regime breakdown in Fig. 1(a). \n\nThe saturation-regime DCS was then investigated with a constant VD of 40 V and VG pulse ranging fro m 0 to 30 V. As shown in Fig. 4, the transfer curves under the saturation-regime DCS exhibit the negative s hift with slight SS deterioration, similar to the Stage-II \nSH degradation [8] in Fig. 2. During the saturation-reg ime current stress, the pinched-off channel may suffer nonuniform degradation from source to drain, thus the degradations of reverse-mode transfer curves were com\n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)\n\nAs compared in the inset of Fig. 4, the saturation\n-regime ID-VG curve measured at VD of 5.1 V exhibits less negative shift in the reverse mode than the forwar d transfer curve, suggesting asymmetric degradations ne ar the source and drain of SH channel. During the sat uration-mode DCS, the higher electric field near drain may cause additional hot-carrier (HC) effect besides th e SH effect. These HCs possibly collide with a-IGZO to dissociate some weak metal-oxygen bonds and thus forme a local drain barrier populated of trap state defe cts [9, 10], elevating the local Vth. With such HC-indu ced higher-Vth region depleted by a relatively high VD\nof 5.1 V, the forward transfer curve thus shifted more negatively than the reverse one. The linear-region trans fer curves at VD = 0.1 V coincide in both forwardand reverse-modes, verifying that HC effect only influen ces the local Vth near drain rather than the whole chan\n\n![2_image_1.png](2_image_1.png)\n\nAlong with the prolonged duration of saturation-re gime DCS, a similar positive loop in Fig. 3(b) was als o triggered to dramatically increase the ID, while the a\n-IGZO TFT rather than became a 'conductor-like' chan nel but exhibited an open-circuit low current, similar t o the low ID after the saturation-regime breakdown in F\nig. 1(b). As shown in Fig. 5(a), the gate-to-source cap acitance (CGS) and gate-to-drain capacitance (CGD) w ere further measured to evaluate the breakdown transist or. After the breakdown under saturation-regime DCS, \nthe drastic distinction between normally-off CGD–VG cur ve and the on-off characteristic of CGS clarifies that th e channel is only disconnected from drain rather than source. In Fig. 5(b), the optical image from the bottom side of saturation-regime breakdown TFT reveals two s eriously damaged regions, the channel/drain interface al ong W (Region Ⅰ) and central channel along L (Region \nⅡ). This is apparently distinct from the that of linear-r egime breakdown TFT in Fig. 3(c). The Region II also corresponds to the central channel of highest SH temp erature. The additional Region Ⅰ clearly reveals the asy mmetric degradations near source and drain, most plaus ibly corresponding to the channel breakage. Consistent with the asymmetric degradations in forward- and rever se-mode ID-VG curves, the Region I points out the HC \neffect is enhanced by the SH-elevated temperature and thus the HC eventually cause much more serious dama ge near the drain side. The resulted barrier of the loca l damage region is so high that the channel is disconn ected from drain side.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nBesides the well-studied bias temperature illumination instabilities of AOS TFTs, the high current stresses could cause much more critical breakdown failures in the advanced applications demanding high driving current. This work further disclosed the complicated degradation behaviors under dynamic current stresses in linear and saturation regimes. At the beginning of dynamic current stresses, both kinds gave rose to the similar negative ΔVth and increasing ID, due to the SH effect. While the linear current stressinduced SH effect eventually forms a 'conductor-like' central region of a-IGZO channel, the saturation current stress triggers an additional HC effect to form a high-barrier region near drain, respectively corresponding to shorted and opencircuit AOS channels.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported by Shenzhen Research Programs under Grants No. GXWD2020123116580700720200807025846001, SGDX20190918105001787, and Grant ITC-PSKL12EG02 from the State Key Laboratory on Advanced Displays and Optoelectronics Technologies.\n\nReferences\n[1] X.

[http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4754627]\nOwing to their high carrier mobility, transparency for visible light, high process compatibility with present solid-state semiconductor technologies, and available room-temperature deposition, transparent amorphous InGaZnO thin films have received considerable attention for their use in next-generation active-matrix liquid-crystal display (AMLCD) and organic light-emitting diode display (AMOLED) technologies.1–5 Sputter deposition technology is widely adopted, especially for the large-size amorphous InGaZnO thin film transistor\n(a-IGZO TFT) display backplane manufacturing. The sputterdeposited a-IGZO active layer typically requires thermal annealing at around 400 -C for 30 min or longer to achieve a satisfactory device performance and stability.6–8 For conventional furnace annealing, thermal energy is transferred to the material of interest by creating a temperature gradient from outward to inward, resulting in additional thermal energy consumption. However, furnace annealing is limited by low efficiency of heating and high thermal budget process. This work presents a novel microwave annealing process for a-IGZO TFT fabrication with low thermal budget process. Microwave heating process can transfer the energy directly to the target materials by absorption of microwave energy throughout the volume of the material. Among its advantages include thermal uniformity, rapid heating process, shortened manufacturing period, low thermal budget, and suppression of unexpected species diffusion.9 Microwave heating is also characterized by selective heating of materials, which is impossible with the typical furnace annealing process.10,11 This work also investigates how microwave annealing affects the electrical performance and reliability of a-IGZO TFTs. A physical mechanism responsible for the electrical enhancement of a-IGZO TFT is also proposed by comparing with the counterpart of a-IGZO\nTFT thermally annealed in a typical furnace at 450 -C for 1 h.\n\nTFT devices with an inverted staggered bottom gate structure without backchannel passivation were fabricated on a glass substrate. A 100-nm-thick Mo layer was formed as a bottom gate electrode in a DC sputtering system, followed by the subsequent deposition of a 150-nm-thick silicon nitride (SiNx) on the patterned gate electrode by plasmaenhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). Next, the active channel layer of a 50-nm-thick a-IGZO layer was formed by DC sputtering at a power of 100 W with an argon flow rate of 10 sccm at room temperature. The target for the a-IGZO film deposition was an IGZO pellet with the component ratio of 1:1:1:4 at. % (In:Ga:Zn:O). A 100-nm-thick indium tin oxide (ITO) was then formed to act as source/drain electrodes by RF sputtering; all of the layers were defined by the shadow masks. The channel width and length of a-IGZO\nTFTs were varied from 200 to 1000 lm. All samples were annealed sequentially in a microwave annealing system with a microwave frequency of 5.8 GHz,12 as shown in Fig. 1(a).\n\nThe microwave power used in this work is 600 W and 1200 W, as denoted by 1P and 2P, respectively. Microwave annealing lasted from 100 s to 600 s. The absorption of electromagnetic wave energy is generally in the frequency range of 2 to 18 GHz for ZnO-based materials.13,14 Therefore, as is expected, the a-IGZO active layer effectively absorbs the microwave energy with the frequency we used in this work. Additionally, a control sample of a-IGZO TFT with a typical thermal annealing process was fabricated for comparison with microwave annealed a-IGZO TFT. The thermal annealing was conducted in a furnace with N2 gas flow rate of 10 l/h at 450 -C for 1 h. Electrical and reliability measurements were carried out using the semiconductor parameter analyzer, Keithley 4200. For the x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement, 50-nm a-IGZO thin films with various microwave annealing conditions were deposited separately on n-type Si wafer.\n\nFigure 1(b) shows the transfer characteristics of a-IGZO\nTFTs with different microwave annealing conditions at a drain-to-source voltage (VDS) of 11 V. The extracted threshold voltage (Vth) and mobility of each a-IGZO TFT were also a)E-mail: ptliu@mail.nctu.edu.tw.\n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)\n\ncompared in the inset. According to this figure, the threshold voltage of a-IGZO TFT decreased from 11.4 to 1.62 V, as the microwave annealing duration increased from 100s to 600s, respectively, with an identical microwave power. Moreover, the mobility increased when increasing the microwave annealing time, indicating that increasing the microwave annealing time improved the electrical characteristics of a-IGZO TFTs.\n\nAs microwave power increases from 1P to 2P with the same process time, the mobility of a-IGZO TFTs is enhanced significantly from 4.86 to 13.9 cm 2 /Vs; in addition, the threshold voltage is lowered from 11.4 to 3.13 V.\n\nThis work also studied how gate bias stress (GBS)\naffects a-IGZO TFTs with different microwave annealing conditions, as shown in Fig. 1 (c) . In the gate bias stress measurements, an electric field of 2.5 MV/cm was applied to gate electrode and source/drain electrodes were grounded. This finding suggests that increasing both microwave power and treatment duration can improve the electrical reliability of a-IGZO TFT. The V th shift of microwave annealed a-\nIGZO TFT after GBS testing was decreased from the value of 16.2 V with the condition of 1P power for 100 s to a minimum of 1.6 V with 2P power for 100 s. Also, increasing the microwave power and annealing duration can enhance microwave energy absorption capacity for the a-IGZO active layer. The material analysis method was performed further to observe the evolution of a-IGZO film structure, allowing us to identify the physical mechanism responsible for improving the electrical properties of a-IGZO TFT devices.\n\nFigure 2 shows the XPS analysis results of O1s spectrum for the a-IGZO thin film with microwave annealing treatments. Two components of O1s peaks could be fitted by Gaussian Lorentzian deconvolution, which centered at 530.6 and 531.4eV, respectively. The lower binding energy centered at 530.6 eV, denoted as peak A, originated from the lattice oxygen ions with neighboring metal atoms. 15 , 16 The higher binding energy peak at 531.4 eV, denoted as peak B,\ncorresponds to O 2 2 ion at an oxygen-deficient region in the matrix of the a-IGZO film. 8,17 According to the results of XPS, peak A increased and peak B decreased while the microwave annealing duration increased, as shown in Figs. 2 (a)–2 (c) , respectively. Also, the XPS spectrum of a-\nIGZO film with high-power microwave annealing was composed of a high intensity of peak A and low intensity of peak B, as shown in Fig. 2(d) . This figure revealed a high content of lattice oxygen ions in the microwave-annealed a-IGZO films with few oxygen-deficient regions as the microwave power was increased. XPS analysis results confirmed that the microwave annealing process assisted the oxygen ions binding with metal atoms and suppressed the formation of oxygen-deficient region in the a-IGZO films when increasing both the microwave power and annealing duration.\n\nFigure 3 compares the effects of microwave and typically used furnace annealing on a-IGZO TFT. The a-IGZO\nTFT with 2P microwave annealing for 100s exhibited a superior performance with a higher mobility and lower subthreshold swing than that of the 450 1 C furnace-annealed a- IGZO TFT as shown in the inset of Fig. 3(a) . After GBS, the microwave annealed a-IGZO TFT also revealed a comparable reliability with the furnace-annealed one, as shown in Fig. 3 . Trap densities ( N t ) can be estimated from subthreshold swing value with the following formula:\n\n## S.S. = Log C 10 × K B T/E[1 + E(Tn T + D It )/C I ],\n\n$$I_{t}+D_{i t})/C_{i}],$$\n\n(1)\nwhere k B denotes the Boltzmann constant; T represents the temperature; e is the elementary electric charge; t is the thickness of the a-IGZO active layer; and D it is the interface trap density, assuming the trap tN t dominated and D it is negligible. 6 The N t value of a-IGZO TFT with microwave and furnace annealing was 2.49 × 10 17 and 3.51 × 10 17 cm −3 respectively. The microwave-annealed a-IGZO exhibited a lower trap density than that of the furnace-annealed one.\n\nFigure 3(b) shows the XPS O1s spectrum of a-IGZO thin film with 2P microwave annealing for 100 s and furnace E:S0:80+SOC dousM\n\n![3_image_0.png](3_image_0.png)\n\nE: S0:80 \\# SOC dousM\nannealing at 450 1 C for 1 h for comparison. The O1s peak of a-IGZO film with microwave annealing composed of a higher intensity of peak A and a lower intensity of peak B than those of the 450 1 C furnace-annealed one. These material analysis results were consistent with the electrical improvement in device performance and reliability of a-IGZO TFT, since microwave annealing facilitated the formation of lattice oxygen and eliminated the defects originating from oxygen deficiency. Energy transfer to the a-IGZO TFT was even more effective by the microwave annealing process than that of the conventional furnace annealing.\n\nIn summary, this work has demonstrated the feasibility of high performance and reliable a-IGZO TFTs with microwave annealing process. Microwave annealing with low thermal budget can reduce the manufacturing process period and improve electrical characteristics of a-IGZO TFTs, due to the effective absorption of microwave energy by the a-IGZO active layer. This selective heating also potentially avoided the damage to materials neighboring the a-IGZO\nchannel layer in the TFT device structure during thermal processes. With optimum microwave annealing around 1200 W for 100 s in this work, electrical performance and reliability of a-IGZO TFT are more significantly promoted than with furnace annealing at 450 1 C for 1 h. Results of this study significantly contribute to microwave annealing applications for us in emerging flat-panel displays of transparent oxide TFTs technology.\n\nThe authors would like to thank the National Science Council of the Republic of China, Taiwan for financially supporting this research under Contract No. NSC 100-2628-\nE-009-016-MY3.

The oxygen-rich ultrathin In-Sn-O layer can effectively reduce the oxygen vacancies concentration of the semiconductor layer from 33.16 to 1.13%. The decrease of oxygen vacancies indicates that the trap density and electron trapping are reduced, resulting in a reduced hysteresis from 0.66 to 0.02 V. Simultaneously, the negative bias illumination stability has been effectively improved from −0.89 to −0.29 V. © 2022 The Japan Society of Applied Physics During the past few years, much research has been made about amorphous In-Ga-Zn-O (IGZO) TFTs which have been applied in the flat-panel display. 1–6) The general hysteresis in practical applications cannot be neglected because of a change in the threshold voltage (VTH)\nin the condition of cycle sweep, especially near the saturation region.7) It is positively correlated with the active/insulating interface defects.8) Moreover, the trap density in the insulating/active interface may be a dominatable factor because the interface between the insulating and active layer has a lot of trap densities and a tremendous amount of oxygen-related vacancies (VO), respectively.9) Up to now, a few techniques have been used to reduce the hysteresis of TFT devices, including composite insulating layer,9) stacked insulating layer,7,10) surface treatment of the active layer,11) and dual-active-layer.12–15) A dual-active-layer based on in situ deposition and synchronous patterning has been demonstrated to effectively reduce trap density at the dielectrics/\nactive interface and improve the stability of the bottom gate TFT, such as low/high-resistance IGZO,13,16,17) In-Sn-O (ITO)/IGZO18,19) and ITO/Ti-Zn-O.20) However, there are few further studies on the mechanism of hysteresis and negative bias illumination stability (NBIS).17) At the same time, there are few reports of reducing the trap density at the dielectrics/active interface of top-gate TFTs through dualactive layers. In this letter, we report a top-gate dual-activelayer ITO/IGZO TFT which has a small hysteresis and excellent stability for NBIS.\n\nFirst, a 200 nm thick buffer layer with SiO2 was deposited on a 200 × 200 mm glass by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). Then a 35 nm thick ITO film was sputtered on the buffer layer as a source-drain electrode.\n\nFollowing this, a 60 nm thick IGZO and an around 5 nm ultrathin ITO film were sequentially sputtered as the active layer. It is worth noting that excessive oxygen is required to deposit ultrathin ITO passivating oxygen vacancies. After that, plasma treatments by reactive-ion etching were used to O2 the channel region. Next, SiO2 with a thickness of 300 nm was successively grown as a gate insulating layer by PECVD.\n\nFinally, 35 nm thick ITO film was sputtered as a gate electrode. All devices were post-annealed at 250 °C for 1 h.\n\nThe ratio of width and length is 8 μm/8 μm. The schematic cross-section diagram and optical top view of the device are shown in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b), respectively.\n\nThe transfer and output characteristics of all devices were measured using Keithley 4200. The VTH is defined as the corresponding gate voltage (VGS) when drain current\n\n![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)\n\n![1_image_1.png](1_image_1.png)\n\n(IDS) = 1 nA. The Hall mobility and carrier concentration of IGZO and ITO/IGZO films were obtained by the HMS-3000 Hall effect measurement system. The chemical bonding was examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS,\nThermo ESCALAB 250XL). The light source used in the NBIS was 1000 lux, by applying VG-Stress= −10 V of 1000 s with source and drain electrodes grounded.\n\nTransfer and output characteristics are shown in Figs. 2(a)\nand 2(b), respectively. The device performances are summarized in Table I. The oxygen-rich ultrathin ITO film with high carrier concentration has a remarkable influence on the current transmission of ITO/IGZO TFTs, which makes the VTH shift negatively and gives a higher on-state current (Ion).\n\nThe performance enhancement is attributed to an increase in carrier concentration and a decrease in the interface trap state.21) The results of the Hall test showed that in comparison with the IGZO film, the carrier concentration of ITO/\nIGZO film increased from 1.92 × 1015 cm−3 to 8.26 × 1016 cm−3, the Hall mobility increased from 13.69 cm2V−1s\n−1 to 22.88 cm2V−1s\n−1. The increase in carrier concentration is mainly due to the Sn4+ doping effect in the oxygen-rich ultrathin ITO.22) The increase in Hall mobility is mainly due to the fact that the electrons in the oxygen-rich ultrathin ITO are spatially separated from ionized donors, which reduces electron scattering at the active/insulator interface.23) The decreased subthreshold swing (SS) indicates that the interface defect has been repaired, which is mainly due to the excess oxygen repairing the interface trap states during the deposition of oxygen-rich ultrathin ITO.21) The mobility (μ) of ITO/IGZO TFT has been significantly improved, which can be attributed to the reduction of structural imperfection and VO because VO plays the part of carriers and traps to inhibit the flow of electrons.24) The high-valence Sn4+ and excess oxygen in ultrathin oxygenrich ITO play the roles of providing abundant free electrons and repairing interfacial defects, respectively.13,20,25)\nAs shown in the insert of Fig. 2(a), the green squares show the magnified area of the forward-backward sweep transfer curves, and the gate voltage changes from −20V to 20 V back to −20V. Both TFTs exhibit the clockwise hysteresis characteristic. In addition, a reverse gate voltage scan was performed, and the gate voltage changed from 20 V to −20V\nand back to 20 V, and the result was a corresponding counterclockwise hysteresis. The result is shown in the black squares in the inset of Fig. 2(a).

The clockwise hysteresis can be attributed to accumulated electrons that are trapped by active/insulating interface defects.\n\nWhen the gate voltage is scanned from − 20V to 20 V, the accumulated electrons are trapped by the unoccupied interface states. However, when the gate voltage is reversed, these trapped electrons will not be de-trapped immediately. 27 ) The oxygen-rich ultrathin ITO channel can provide additional electrons to remedy the trapped electrons in the insulating layer and provide a large amount of electrons to passivate interface defects, thereby reducing ∆ V H . 13 ) In addition, the high ∆ V H may also be ascribed to the involvement of the border traps. 26) So the defect state of the insulating/channel interface is passivated with oxygen-rich ultrathin ITO, so that the electrons cannot be bound by the interface defect, thereby reducing the ∆ V H . 27 )\nFigure 2 (b) and the black squares inset show the output characteristics and the magnified view, respectively. Both TFTs show good ohmic contact at low drain voltages and low source/drain resistance. 28,29) It can be clearly found that ITO/\nIGZO TFT has a higher drain current and lower on-resistance than IGZO TFT. This is because ITO/IGZO TFT has high mobility and low contact resistance. 23 , 29 )\nTo further clarify the influence mechanism of the oxygenrich ultrathin ITO, the schematic diagram of XPS depth profile measurement is shown in Figs. 3 (a) and 3 (b).\n\nAccording to previous reports, the metal–oxygen bonding\n(M–O) and V O peaks were found at 530.2 eV, 530.9 eV,\nrespectively. 24 , 30 ) Obviously, the M–O content in the oxygen-rich ultrathin ITO active layer is as high as 98.87%, indicating that there is a large amount of M-O-M\nnetwork, so that the metal s orbital overlap is very high, which will achieve high mobility and low hysteresis. 28) This also further confirms the results of the Hall test. In addition, the oxygen-rich ITO layer can effectively reduce the V O from 3.16% to 1.13%, passivation interface defects, and reduce the deep donor electron traps. 24 )\nIn order to verify the prospect of oxygen-rich ultrathin ITO\nin practical applications of IGZO TFT, the NBIS of the device is shown in Fig. 4 . As the time of illumination and gate bias are increased, the threshold voltage is drifted in the negative direction. NBIS-caused V TH drift is mainly attributed to the existence of positively ionized oxygen vacancies, which are formed by the loss of electrons through neutral oxygen vacancies (Vo -> Vo +/Vo++) under the combined action of light and a large negative gate field. 31) The ITO/\n\n![2_image_2.png](2_image_2.png)\n\n070914-2\n\n![3_image_0.png](3_image_0.png)\n\nIGZO TFT has a lower threshold voltage drift (ΔVTH) than IGZO TFT, which is attributed to a large amount of oxygen introduced to reduce the density of neutral VO and the positive charges (*Vo o* /V + ++) during the deposition of ultrathin ITO.2) At the same time, increasing carrier concentration, decreasing total trap density, and passivated oxygen vacancy can also reduce ΔVTH.\n\n24,32)\nIn summary, the oxygen-rich ultrathin ITO layer inserted between the SiO2 insulating layer and the IGZO active layer can effectively reduce the top-gate TFT hysteresis voltage, which is reduced from 0.66 V to 0.02 V. This is mainly because the oxygen-rich ultrathin ITO effectively passivates the interface oxygen-related vacancies from 33.16% to 1.13%\nand repairs the interface defects that SS reduced from 0.23 V\ndec–1 to 0.19 V dec–1. At the same time, the reduction of deep donor electron traps in the active region can reduce the amount of electrons trapped at the interface, so that the NBIS\nis improved from −0.89 V to −0.29 V. The oxygen-rich ultrathin ITO may be a new technology to inhibition hysteresis for top-gate IGZO TFT.\n\nAcknowledgments This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 62174105, Shanghai Education Development Foundation and Shanghai Municipal Education Commission under Grant 18SG38 and Program of Shanghai Academic/Technology Research Leader under Grant 18XD1424400.\n\nORCID iDs Cong Peng https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8400779X Xifeng Li https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0508-869X\n\n1) C.

        "text": "# The Application And Future Development Trend Of Oxide Technology In The Meta-Universe\n\nCe Ning*, Lizhong Wang, Binbin Tong, Jinchao Zhang, Guangcai Yuan \n* BOE Technology Group Co., Ltd., No. 9 Dize Rd, BDA, Beijing 100176, China Abstract With the rise of concept \"meta-universe\", VR/AR products get more attention currently. This paper introduces the applied oxide technology in ultra-high resolution VR products and its future development trend. It was investigated how oxide technology become the choice of ultra-high resolution due to its transparent property. It was also highly researched how to ensure the device characteristics with short channel through adjustment of process route. In the end, the future trend, such as higher mobility and removal of light shield layer, is simply introduces. \n\n## Author Keywords\n\noxide TFT, metaverse, transmittance, short channel. \n\n## 1. Background\n\nThe rise of the concept of \"meta-universe\" makes VR/AR become a hot topic of attention again. The meta-universe is the integration and interaction between the real world and the virtual world. As an important port into the meta-universe, VR/AR brings people vivid visual and auditory perception. Compared with AR, VR can give people a stronger sense of immersion, and is widely used in fields such as watching movies and playing games. Since VR is a near-eye display device, higher resolution is needed to improve the display quality compared with conventional display devices. Resolution is as direct feeling of clarity of display devices, if it is too low, we even can directly see the pixels in the panel, which is similar to seeing the world through a screen window, which is called \"screen door effect\". However, when the resolution is increased and pixel area is reduced, the proportion of metal lines such as gate lines and data lines will increase, resulting in the decrease of the actual opening ratio of pixels. The overall transmittance of the screen will also shrinks and the brightness under the same backlight will decrease. Therefore, improving the transmittance of the screen is also an urgent problem to be solved by VR products. \n\nCompared with conventional LTPS (low-temperature poly silicon) TFT Process, transparent oxide material can be used as data lines in the active area in pixel, which can make a great progress in improving opening aperture ratio; in the meanwhile, it is easier to achieve single-metal-gate structure for oxide TFT, \nsince it has a lower leakage current of off state than LTPS TFT, \nwhich leads the opening ratio can be further improved. \n\nFor ultra-high PPI VR products, the TFT device characteristics are also a key factor restricting the further reduction of pixel size. Therefore, the development of short channel oxide TFT process technology is a problem that must be solved for ultra-high resolution products. The present applied process technology and mechanism explanation is also described in this paper. For current short channel oxide technology, BOE has completed the development of 1500PPI VR technology based on LTPO process. For the future development trend of oxide technology, we will focus on how to further improve the mobility of oxide TFTs and how to further improve the light stability. \n\n## 2. **The Application And Future Trend Of Oxide** Technology In Vr Products\n\nDevelopment of increasing pixel transmittance with transparent oxide material: As shown in figure 1, Ultra-high PPI process is restricted by the pixel size and exposure capacity, the SD layer must adopt a two-layer scheme. Meanwhiles, due to its large leakage current of LTPS TFT, the two-gate structure must be used to reduce the leakage. These two factors of LTPS \nProcess leads to the limitation of pixel opening rate. In addition, low-temperature polysilicon as a narrow-gap semiconductor, its transmittance is low, which results that the transmittance of the screen is further reduced, when it is placed in the active area region. \n\n![0_image_0.png](0_image_0.png)\n\nAt present, non-transparent materials such as Cu, Mo and Al are used as data lines in the technical route of mass-produced display products, especially in large-size products. As for current 1000PPI VR products with LTPS process, Ti/Al/Ti, also a nontransparent material, is used. However, with the further improvement of resolution, these conventional non-transparent materials can no longer meet the demand of aperture opening rate, so it is urgent to develop transparent metal electrodes. ITO, as a transparent metal, is always the first choice for the SD electrodes. \n\nBut the deposition process of ITO will inevitably lead to the oxidation of aSi or LTPS surface, resulting in the increase of the contact resistance between the channel and SD electrode, thus affecting the final signal output. Therefore, the combination of oxide thin film transistor and transparent electrode may become the final solution for increasing opening ratio in the future. As shown in figure 2, ITO is used as drain electrode in the pixel layout and oxide semiconductor is also worked as a part of data lines, which takes advantage of the high transmittance of oxide semiconductor and can be routed in the pixel area. It is of great significance for the improvement of the opening rate. \n\n![1_image_1.png](1_image_1.png)\n\n![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)\n\npixel design \nDevelopment of short channel oxide TFT device characteristics: The current shortest channel of oxide thin film transistor is above 4um in mass production. In order to improve the opening ratio of ultra-high PPI products, the channel size is required to be at least below 3um, so we must overcome the short channel effect of oxide TFT. For Vth, as the channel decreases, the influence of H/O diffusion on the actual channel size increases dramatically (shown in figure 3),which will lead to the Vth shift and the nonuniformity. For NBTIS,short channel means the decrease of the light shield size, and the NBTIS characteristics of oxide thin film transistors is also easier influenced by backlight. Herein, Through we optimized key processes innovatively, such as GI retention process, high temperature annealing process and channel matching inorganic film deposition process, we finally meet device characteristics requirement with channel length L=2.5um. \n\n![1_image_2.png](1_image_2.png)\n\nThe conventional Oxide Top Gate technology adopts GI removal process, and IGZO conducts during the GI etching process. However, this process is more suitable for oxide thin film transistor with long channel, because IGZO conducting is mainly realized by light elements implanting such as H implant during the etching process, but it is not beneficial to the development of short channel devices due to the diffusion effect. \n\nFigure 4 the H/O diffusion path in the Oxide TFT device. \n\n① the H diffusion path to the channel; ② & ③ the H diffusion path blocked by SiO2 and Gate; ④ the H diffusion path outward; ⑤ the O diffusion path to the channel\nThe GI retention process route was adopted in the Oxide \n\n![1_image_3.png](1_image_3.png)\n\ntechnology. The GI retention process can well protect the interface area of IGZO, and the oxygen in GI layer can further ensure the short channel characteristics of IGZO. As shown in figure 4, the diffusion path of H/O are illustrated, the hydrogen atom which is introduced into the channel can be ionized into H+ \nand form -OH with O2-, providing free electrons; and it can also combine with oxygen to form an oxygen vacancy Vo, which as a donor, will also give away free electrons. Contrarily, the oxygen atom O diffused into the channel will reduce the oxygen vacancy and reduce the donor impurity concentration, reducing the concentration of free electrons. Herein, through adjusting the inorganic film deposition process and high temperature process, the H/O diffusion impact can be controlled, and finally the device characteristics of L=2.5um oxide thin film transistor were ensured, as shown in figure 5. Vth is at 0.28V, the open-state current can be larger than 5e-6A and off-state current is smaller than 2e-13A. It can be also realized that the NBTIS drift of 2h is within 1.5V and PBTS drift of 2h is within 1V. \n\nNBTIS, the offset of Vth under temperature and light. The figure 6 shows the schematic diagram of NBTIS influence principle of oxide thin film transistor. The key determined factors of NBTIS\nresult are the light intensity irradiated to the channel, the concentration of carrier and defect state in the channel, and the interface between the active layer and GI layer. For ultra-high resolution products, due to the overall low opening ratio, the backlight intensity must be improved to ensure the final screen display brightness. However, with the increase of backlight intensity, the light stability of oxide thin film transistor will become worse. The final result is that the transistor cannot be turned off and the screen will appear white Mura. \n\n![2_image_1.png](2_image_1.png)\n\nFigure 6 the schematic diagram of light-induced Vth Offset (NBTIS mechanism). Electrons and holes are generated by irradiation (left); defect DOS traps holes \n(middle); Defect level in GI layer traps holes. (right) \nHerein, we systematically studied the relative relationship between the light shield and NBTIS. As shown in figure 7, the final light intensity accepted by IGZO channel was related to size of light shield, the thickness of Buffer layer, and the distance between LS and IGZO. According to the experiment results, the larger LS size and the thinner Buffer layer, the less light can be shined into channel, the better NBTIS result we can reach. \n\n![2_image_2.png](2_image_2.png)\n\nExcept for certain the optimal light shield size, we also adjust the high temperature process condition and improve Buffer-O/GI film quality to decrease the interface defects, which can impact NBTIS characteristic. The overall results are shown in figure 8. In conclusion, we can realize that the NBTIS drift of 12h within 3V, reaching the industry-leading level.\n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)\n\nBy using the above introduced Oxide technology, BOE has successfully made the high transmittance ultra-high 1500 PPI VR LCD demo. The resolution reaches 2160*2160 and the actual measured transmittance gets 1.5%. The detailed specification of display panel are shown in table 1. \n\n| Panel specification        |                |\n|----------------------------|----------------|\n| Screen size(inch)          | 2.1''          |\n| TFT type                   | LTPO           |\n| Resolution                 | 2160*2160      |\n| Pixel pitch(um)            | 5.8*17.4       |\n| Compatible refreshing rate | 90Hz           |\n| Response time(ms)          | GTG Max 5ms    |\n| Contrast ratio             | ≥500:1,typ.600 |\n| CR(polar angle 30°)        | ≥100:1         |\n| Trans.                     | 2%             |\n\n![2_image_3.png](2_image_3.png)\n\nFuture development trend of oxide technology: For future development of oxide technology, the higher mobility must be the next pursued purpose. Compared with LTPS, the oxide material has a lower mobility due to the different conducting mechanism. The oxygen vacancy, as the actual carrier provider in the oxide material, is hard to be controlled in the thin film transistor. Therefore, it will be significant how to develop a set of technology process with higher mobility oxide material. \n\nExcept for mobility, the further development of light stability is also essential for oxide TFT. By increasing resolution of VR \nproducts, the proportion of metal lines play a key role in the pixel layout. Currently, light shield layer is used to ensure the light stability, but the width of metal shading layer is more than 2um larger than the Gate line width, which directly leads to the reduction of pixel opening ratio. Therefore, removing metal shading layer and improving the material light stability characteristics of channel are the inevitable direction of the development of oxide technology in the future. \n\n## 3. Summary\n\nThis paper systematically introduces the current application and the future development trend of ultra-high PPI oxide technology in VR/AR products of metauniverse from three aspects: 1. Through the introduction of transparent ITO electrode and IGZO data line, the panel transmittance can be greatly improved; 2. Through the optimization of light path, deposition process of IGZO and inorganic film layer, the basic device characteristics of L=2.5um oxide device can be ensured, and the drift of 12-hour NBTIS is within 3V, reaching the industry leading level; 3. For the development trend of oxide technology, it must be the future goal to develop a set of technological routes suitable for oxide devices with high mobility. At the same time, by removing light shield layer, the transmittance of the panel can be further improved, so the light stability of the oxide need to improved under this condition. \n\n## 4.

        "text": "# The Effects Of Buffer Layers On The Electrical Characteristics And Stability Of Self-Aligned Top-Gate Igzo Thin Film Transistors Yi-Da Ho*, Yu-Xin Yang, Ching-Fei Yang, Hung-Wei Li, Chih-Hung Tsai, Hsueh-Hsing Lu, Yu-Hsin Lin Hsinchu Science Park, Hsinchu, Taiwan R.O.C. New Display Process Research Division, Au Optronics Co., Ltd.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe composition of buffer layer would be played a key role to affect the electrical performance and the reliability of the selfaligned top-gate a-IGZO TFTs. In this work, the threshold voltage shift (ΔVth) of the device could be less than ±1V under positive and negative bias thermal illumination stress. \n\n## Key Words\n\na-IGZO TFTs, buffer layer, NBTIS \n\n## 1. Objective And Background\n\nTo date, a-Si:H TFTs and poly-Si TFTs are the two kinds of the main devices in the driving circuits of the active-matrix displays. But they may not be able to meet the advanced display requirements in the future due to the low field-effect mobility of a-Si:H TFTs [1] and the nonuniformity issue of poly-Si TFTs. Recently, amorphous InGaZnO (a-IGZO) TFTs has been studied extensively for many promising applications in next generation displays such as organic light-emitting diodes (OLED) displays, flexible displays and E-paper [2-5]. The a-IGZO TFTs have a high on/off current ratio, a high field-effect mobility (μFE) that is much higher than that of the a-Si:H TFTs [6], and usually show a much steeper subthreshold swing than the a-Si:H and poly-Si TFTs. These advantages make the a-IGZO TFTs suitable for the low voltage and low-power dissipation applications [7]. \n\nHowever, the instability phenomenon of a-IGZO TFTs which are caused by the charge trapping mechanism [8], the thermal effect [9], the illumination effect, and the adsorption of water/oxygen molecules [10] would obstacle their applications to the next-generation displays. It has been reported that the stability of a-IGZO TFTs is very sensitive to the process conditions, such as the annealing temperature or environment [11], the IGZO deposition parameters or the passivation layer material [12]. For top-gate IGZO TFT, the buffer layer is also a key factor on the stability of a-IGZO TFTs because of the direct contact of the buffer layer and the active layer. In this work, we report the effect of buffer layer composition on the performance and stability of self-aligned top-gate IGZO TFTs. A plausible mechanism is based on the oxygen and/or hydrogen radicals can be supplied from buffer layer to the IGZO layer or IGZO/buffer interface. And then the effect of the adsorbed water/oxygen molecules could be balanced.\n\n2. Results The self-aligned top-gate a-IGZO TFTs were fabricated on the glass substrates in this work. The schematic cross-section of the TFTs used in this study is depicted in the right side of Fig. 1. The a-IGZO layer was deposited on the glass substrates or buffer layers at room temperature by a sputtering system. Then, the gate insulator (GI) was grown by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). After gate electrode patterning, the GI was then etched using a self-aligned process. Then, a 300-nm-thick interlayer was deposited by PECVD and the n+ regions of the aIGZO were formed by annealing. The via-holes were patterned to define the source/drain (S/D) region. Finally, Al-based metal was sputtered to form the S/D electrode. In this work, the electrical parameters of the top-gate IGZO TFTs were extracted by using Keithley 4200 semiconductor characterization system. Table I. The comparison of the electrical parameters of the \n\n![0_image_0.png](0_image_0.png)\n\n![0_image_1.png](0_image_1.png) top-gate a-IGZO TFTs with various process conditions. Fig. 1 Vth shift under positive bias stress (PBS) and negative bias stress (NBS) for the devices with different process conditions. \n\nThe electrical parameters of the top-gate a-IGZO TFTs with different process conditions (buffer layer, IGZO condition and the deposition temperature of the gate insulator) were listed in Table I. Several important parameters such as threshold voltage \n(Vth), mobility (Ć), subthreshold swing (SS) and DIBL were extracted under dark conditions. In this work, the Vth was determined as the gate voltage (Vg) which induced a normalized drain current (Id) of 1nA. Base on the experimental results, the electrical properties of the a-IGZO TFTs were highly dependent on the process condition. In is worth to mention that, the mobility of the devices without buffer layer is much higher than that of the devices with buffer layer. Moreover, the reliability is another important issue on the TFT devices. Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 are the Vth shift of the devices with different process conditions and different bias conditions respectively. The stress condition was set at Vg =\n±30 V (PBS/NBS) and the stress times was 1000 sec. The source and drain electrodes were grounded during the stress. (Vgs= ±30 V at room temperature for PBS/NBS; Vg = ±30 V at 60°C for PBTS/NBTS; Vg = ±30 V at 60°C with light illumination for PBTIS/NBTIS). From the results, the devices with excellent stability could be obtained by using the suitable process conditions, even the devices were stressed under the thermal and/or illumination conditions. The threshold voltage shift (∆Vth) of the device without buffer layer is less than 1V and -0.1V under positive and negative bias thermal illumination stress respectively; the ∆ Vth of the device with buffer layer is less than 0.1V and -1V\n\n![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)\n\nThe role of buffer layer in the electric characteristics and the stability of the IGZO TFTs should be discussed. For comparison, two different annealing processes were used in this work. The half of the devices was annealed before the IGZO\ndeposition (device 2-1 and 2-3), and the other half of them was not (device 2-2 and 2-4). Figs. 3(a) and 3(b) show the transfer characteristics of the aforementioned devices and the electrical parameters are summarized in the inset table of the figures. The results show that the electrical properties of the device 2-1 and 2-2\n(without buffer layers) are almost the same and only a slight difference in the Vth and mobility could be found between the device 2-3 and device 2-4 (SiOx buffer layers). However, the stability tests show the very different results from the Id-Vg test. In Fig 4(a), the positive Vth shift could be observed in the devices with SiOx buffer layers, but the highly negative Vth shift was found in the devices 2-1 and device 2-2 (without buffer layers).\n\nBy the experimental results, a possible mechanism is proposed as following. Before annealing, the water and oxygen molecules were randomly adsorbed on the hydrophilic surface of the glass or SiOx buffer layers. During the annealing process, the Van der Waals bonds of the adsorbed species could be easily broken and the water species were preferentially adsorbed again on the hydrophilic surface. The schematic of the adsorbed species before and after the annealing process is shown in the inset figure of Fig. 4(b). By the experimental results, the difference of the device degradation mechanism is clearly related to the buffer layer, which is suggested that the appropriate suppression of effect of the adsorbed water and oxygen [10] on the IGZO layer is important to obtain devices with good performance and stability. However, it is questionable why so different between the degradation behavior of the device on glass and on buffer layer.\n\n![1_image_1.png](1_image_1.png)\n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)\n\n![2_image_3.png](2_image_3.png)\n\nIn order to clarify the role of the buffer layer played in the electric characteristics and the stability of the IGZO TFTs.\n\nThe electrical properties and stability of the IGZO TFTs with several kinds of buffer layers were compared. The electrical properties, transfer characteristics and reliability tests of the devices show in Table II, Fig. 5 and Fig.6 respectively. Device 31, which has a single SiOx buffer, has very poor transfer characteristics with the Vth value of -7.33V and the highly negative Vth shift of -0.66V after 1000s PBS; device 3-2 (single SiNx buffer layer) shows completely conductive due to the hydrogen related defects that may have diffused from the SiNx acted as carrier donors [13]. On the other hands, the devices\n(device 2-3 and device 3-3) with an Oxygen-rich SiOx buffer show good performance and stability. The large difference in the electric characteristics and reliability among the devices might be due to the variation in the buffer layer composition. A buffer oxide film with higher oxygen containing than the stoichiometric composition, the oxygen and/or hydrogen radicals could be supplied from buffer layer to the IGZO layer or IGZO/buffer interface while the effect of the water, oxygen or hydrogen could be suppressed.\n\n![2_image_1.png](2_image_1.png)\n\n![2_image_2.png](2_image_2.png)\n\n## 3. Impact\n\nThe IGZO TFTs have been widely investigated for their various benefits such as high on/off current ratio, high field-effect mobility (μFE), steep subthreshold swing and wide bandgap, which make them suitable for the high performance and lowpower dissipation applications. However, the stability of a-IGZO \nTFTs is very sensitive to the process conditions. In this work, the devices with excellent stability could be fabricated by using the suitable process conditions; even the active layer was deposited on the glass directly. In addition, the effect of the buffer layers on the degradation of the self-aligned top-gate IGZO TFTs was discussed. The degradation originated from the adsorption of water and/or oxygen molecules could be suppressed by the radicals that were supplied by the buffer layer. According to the experimental results, the composition of the buffer layer would be played a key role to affect the performance and reliability of the top-gate IGZO TFTs. \n\n4. **References**\n[1] T.

First, the question of how to achieve high-performance oxide TFTs is addressed, including the exploration of new channel materials, the realization of low-resistance ohmic contacts and the implementation of high-k dielectric materials as the gate insulator. The electrical instability of the oxide TFTs is also discussed, which is critical for their application in flexible backplane electronics: special attention is given to the understanding of the degradation mechanism of oxide TFTs against bias thermal stress (BTS) and light illuminated BTS. Finally, the recent application of oxide TFTs in active matrix displays, such as electronic paper, liquid crystal displays and organic light-emitting diodes, is addressed. (Some figures in this article are in colour only in the electronic version)\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nFlexible electronic displays are of tremendous interest for future applications, including mobile phone displays, automotive stereo panels, smart identity cards, and wearable displays, because of the greater freedom that they afford in their design. Among the various display modes, including liquid crystal displays (LCDs) and electronic paper (E-paper), the organic light-emitting diode (OLED) is considered the ultimate choice for flexible displays, because it offers several advantages such as a vivid moving picture, low power consumption, no cell-gap problem and good form factor for ultra slimness. Flexible active-matrix (AM) OLED displays can be achieved by using a bendable substrate, such as a metal foil and plastic sheet, instead of a conventional glass substrate. So far, flexible AMOLED displays have been demonstrated on both metal foil and plastic substrates, using polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si), amorphous silicon (a-Si) or organic transistors as the active elements [1–5]. Organic thin-film transistors (TFTs) have been intensively studied, because they offer the possibility of reducing the processing temperature and cost compared to a-Si TFTs, and also rollto-roll manufacturing [6, 7]. Nevertheless, the relatively 0268-1242/11/034008+10$33.00 1 © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd Printed in the UK & the USA\nlow mobility (<1 cm2 (V s)−1) and inferior bias stability of a-Si and organic TFTs may limit their practical usage in flexible electronics [8–13]. In contrast, poly-Si TFTs exhibit a high mobility (>80 cm2 (Vs)−1) and excellent device stability. However, poly-Si technology requires a high thermal budget (>450 ◦C) as well as an expensive crystallization and doping process, which fundamentally hinders the usage of plastic substrates [14–16]. In this regard, metal oxide TFT technology has recently gained considerable attention, due to its high mobility, low temperature capability, good transparency to visible light and relatively low fabrication cost. The high fabrication cost of poly-Si TFTs aforementioned can be alleviated by replacing them with metal oxide TFTs, because oxide TFTs can be fabricated without a crystallization and intentional doping process. Furthermore, amorphous oxide semiconductors have a lower density-of-states (DOS), including the tailing state and deep level state, compared to that of a-Si semiconductors [17–19], which results in superior electrical stability. Originally, metal oxides including ZnO and indium tin oxide (ITO) have been used as the transparent conducting material for optoelectronics applications, such as LCDs, OLEDs and solar cells. The degenerated high n-type conductivity is known to come from the large free electron\n\n![3_image_0.png](3_image_0.png)\n\ndensity (>1018 cm−3), due to either oxygen vacancies or incorporated hydrogen impurities [20–22]. First, metal oxide TFTs were fabricated using a SnO2 semiconductor as the channel layer, as shown in figure 1 [23]. The Ion/off ratio of the fabricated oxide TFT, however, was quite low (∼102),\nwhich can be attributed to the high net electron density (Nd ) of the SnO2 thin film. In order to fabricate oxide TFTs with high performance, it is essential to reduce the Nd value of the oxide film to about 1015 ∼ 1017 cm−3, as this is a prerequisite for the efficient modulation of the depletion layer by the applied gate voltage. The Nd value of metal oxide films can be diminished by either increasing the oxygen partial pressure during the deposition of the oxide semiconductor layer or high temperature annealing [24–26]. The moderate control of the Nd value (1015–1017 cm−3) of the oxide film enables the usage of an oxide thin film as the active channel material in TFTs.\n\nIn this paper, the current status and challenges of oxide TFT technology for flexible displays are described, with the description being divided into three parts. The first part focuses on high-performance oxide TFTs including the exploration of new channel materials, the realization of low ohmic contacts and the implementation of high-k dielectric materials as a gate insulator. Then, the electrical instability of the oxide TFTs is discussed: attention will be given to the degradation mechanism of oxide TFTs against bias thermal stress (BTS)\nand light illuminated BTS. Finally, the third part addresses the recent application of oxide TFTs to AM displays such as E-paper, LCDs and OLEDs.\n\n## 2. High-Performance Oxide Tfts 2.1. Zno-Based Oxide Semiconductor For High Mobility\n\nAlthough all of the device parameters, including the fieldeffect mobility (μFE), subthreshold gate swing (SS), threshold voltage (Vth) and Ion/off ratio, are equally important for efficient panel design, the μFE of TFTs has been cited as the most crucial parameter, because it is directly related to the current driving capability and the resulting circuit speed. A ZnO thin film has been investigated for optoelectronics applications, such as light-emitting diodes and lasers, for a long time, because it has the advantages of good crystalline film quality induced by epitaxial growth, a large exciton binding energy\n(∼60 meV) and high transparency to visible light (Eg ∼\n3.4 eV) [27]. However, the ZnO film used as a channel layer for TFTs should be mainly deposited by physical vapor deposition techniques, such as sputtering or pulsed laser deposition, rather than chemical vapor deposition, due to the low softening temperature of the glass or plastic substrate. The ZnO TFTs in previous studies exhibited a steady improvement in the fieldeffect mobility from ∼0.2 to >20 cm2 (Vs)−1, which was achieved by the optimization of the microstructure, thermal annealing, and/or the adoption of a novel gate insulator\n[28–31]. However, it is noted that the ZnO thin film can be very easily crystallized during the deposition process, leading to the formation of grain boundary defects. The existence of grain boundaries causes a non-uniformity problem in terms of μFE and Vth, which may hinder the implementation of ZnO\nTFTs in flexible AMOLED displays. Although this nonuniformity of the device parameters may be resolved by means of a compensation circuit, such as a 5 transistor + 2 capacitor pixel circuit, the complexity of the pixel circuit leads to the loss of the device yield and, thus, an increase in the fabrication cost\n[32]. Therefore, it is imperative to search for amorphous metal oxide semiconductors with device properties comparable to those of ZnO TFTs.\n\nIn 2004, Hosono *et al* explored a new class of amorphous oxide semiconductors based on InGaZnO (indium gallium zinc oxide, IGZO) and demonstrated that high-performance transistors (μFE ∼ 8.3 cm2 (Vs)−1) can be fabricated using the IGZO thin film deposited even at room temperature [33].\n\nThis report created significant worldwide interest in highend LCD and AMOLED technology, both in industry and academia, because of its potential for high mobility, excellent uniformity in the device parameters, and good scalability to a large substrate size. The origin of the high mobility, even in the amorphous state, was attributed to the unique material band structure, as shown in figure 2. The conduction band of IGZO materials is closely related to the In 5 s orbital, which has isotropic properties. Interestingly, the spherical symmetry of the 5 s orbital makes the structural disordering no longer critical. So even if the phase is transformed into the amorphous state, the a-IGZO semiconductor still has high mobility. This is in strong contrast to silicon semiconductors, in which the mobility significant drops from 1000 to 1 cm2 (Vs)−1 when the phase transforms from the crystalline state to the amorphous state. The other important design concept of IGZO is that the incorporated Ga ions act as a carrier suppressor of the IZO conducting oxide and network stabilizer [34]. Since then, progress in the device performance of IGZO TFTs has been accelerated via the optimization of the cation composition [35, 36], the adoption of large area scalable gate insulator materials such as SiNx or SiO2 [37, 38], and the improvement of the device architecture [39]. As a result, many prototype IGZO TFT-driven AM displays have been demonstrated, including 4 full-color e-Paper [40], 3.5 QCIF+ (quarter common intermediate format) AMOLEDs [37], 12.1 WXGA (wide extended graphic array) AMOLEDs [38], 15 XGA (extended graphic array) AMLCDs [41], and 6.5 flexible AMOLEDs [42].\n\n![4_image_0.png](4_image_0.png)\n\n![4_image_1.png](4_image_1.png)\n\n![4_image_2.png](4_image_2.png)\n\nIn spite of the high performance of the IGZO TFTs, their electrical stability still remains a critical issue, which has driven the search for new robust active materials. The basic approach is to find an efficient stabilizer of the oxide channel materials against electrical, thermal, ambient stress. Thus, novel multi-component oxide systems have been explored including Zr–In–Zn–O [43] and Hf–In–Zn–O [44], which suggests the feasibility of robust oxide TFTs. The Zr or Hf atoms replacing the Ga atoms in the IGZO matrix were shown to act as a strong oxygen binder of the amorphous oxide network, leading to the improvement of the bias stability of the resulting TFTs, as shown in figure 3.\n\nHowever, the following issue needs to be addressed before ZnO-based oxide TFTs can be adopted as a backplane device in flexible AM displays. The high mobility and device stability of oxide TFTs have been achieved based on systems incorporating indium (In) and gallium (Ga),\nrespectively, which are rare elements that suffer from serious depletion and for which accurate and repeatable control during mass production may be difficult [45–47]. Therefore, there have been some attempts to search for In- and Gafree or lower content channel materials. For this purpose, indium-free multi-component oxide channel materials such as ZnSnO and GaSnZnO have been investigated in an attempt to replace the expensive In atoms with cheap Sn atoms\n[48–51]. The important parameters of devices with stateof-the-art characteristics among the metal oxide TFTs investigated up to now are summarized and compared in table 1. It is noted that a high μFE of 31.9 cm2 (Vs)−1 and low SS of 0.07 V/decade (approaching the ideal SS value)\nwere recently obtained for multi-component Al–Sn–Zn–In–O (AT-ZIO) TFTs without any deterioration of the off-state drain current and Vth value (Ion/off ratio ∼ 2 × 109, Vth ∼ −0.2 V),\nas shown in figure 4 [52].\n\n## 2.2. Ohmic Contact Of Oxide Semiconductor\n\nThe μFE value of oxide TFTs can be adversely affected by the contact resistance between the source/drain and channel regions. In the case of poly-Si TFT and CMOS Si technology, intentional and selective doping is usually performed by ion doping/implantation and a subsequent activation annealing process, which gives rise to a very low contact resistance\n(<10−4 - cm−2). However, the traditional ion doping\n\n| Table 1. A comparison of the various parameters including μFE, Vth, SS, and the Ion/off ratio for various metal oxide TFTs. Oxide semiconductor μFE (cm2 (Vs)−1) Vth (V) SS (V/dec) Ion/off ratio Reference ZnO 27 19 1.39 3 × 105 [28] IGZO 12 1.4 0.20 1 × 108 [53] IGZO 19.3 0.59 0.35 1.5 × 107 [36] HIZO 10 −4.7 0.23 108 [44] AT-ZIO 31.9 −0.2 0.07 2 × 109 [52]   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n\n![5_image_0.png](5_image_0.png)\n\n![5_image_1.png](5_image_1.png)\n\ntechnique for the ohmic contact is nearly impossible for ZnO-based semiconductors, due to the requirement of a high activation temperature (>700 ◦C) and the difficulty in activating the implanted donor, which is not applicable to the plastics substrates used for flexible displays [54, 55].\n\nInstead, approaches exploiting the specific features of ZnObased materials have been attempted to reduce the contact resistance. For example, because the Nd of IGZO film is dramatically increased from 1014 cm−3 (pristine) to\n∼1020 cm−3 upon Ar plasma treatment, the selective plasma treatment of the source/drain contact region was shown to improve the contact resistance of the IGZO TFT from 1550 to 330 - cm, leading to an ∼3 fold increase of μFE [56]. The other interesting approach is to utilize the fact that the incorporated hydrogen in ZnO-based materials acts as a shallow donor. The intentional incorporation of hydrogen into the channel layer can be accomplished by either direct hydrogen plasma treatment [57] or hydrogen diffusion\n[58] from capping layers such as PECVD-derived (plasmaenhanced chemical vapor deposition) SiNx containing a huge amount of hydrogen atoms (>1020 cm−3). However, the necessary long-term reliability of metal oxide TFTs with improved contact properties has not been studied yet, because the structural and electrical stability of the oxide channel layer can be adversely affected by various plasma treatments or hydrogen diffusion.\n\nLow power consumption is one of the key issues for the mobile application of flexible displays, due to the weight and size of the rechargeable lithium-ion battery used as a power source [59]. An effective way of reducing the power consumption is to improve the SS characteristics and, thus, to diminish the driving voltage range. In general, the high-k dielectric in TFTs plays an important role in increasing the capacitive coupling between the gate and active channel layer, thereby improving the SS value and reducing the operation voltage range. Several groups have reported promising results based on the usage of high-k metal oxides such as MgO/Bi1.5Zn1.0Nb1.5O7 (BZN)\n(k ∼ 31) [60], BZN (k ∼ 51) [61], Zn0.7Mg0.3O (k ∼ 15) [62],\nMgO-Ba0.6Sr0.4TiO3 (k ∼ 9.96) [63], Y2O3 (k ∼ 18) [53], HfO2 (k ∼ 16) [64], ZrO2 [65], Al2O3 (k ∼ 18) [66], and TiO2 (k ∼ 40) [67] in ZnO-based oxide TFTs. However, high-k dielectric films may suffer from a relatively high leakage current, due to their low band-gap, and the large polarization of the high-k insulator can have an adverse effect on the mobility, and these issues have not been addressed yet. Furthermore, it is still necessary to investigate the chemical stability, interfacial trap distribution and related device instability for high-k/metal oxide semiconductors.\n\n## 3. Instability Of Oxide Tfts 3.1. Bias Thermal Instability\n\nThe simplest unit pixel circuit of an AMOLED basically comprises two transistors (switching and driving transistors).\n\nIn the case of the switching transistor, the variation of μFE\nand Vth is less important, because the on- and off-state voltage conditions can be carefully chosen to take into consideration the bias-dependent or process-dependent parameter margins.\n\nHowever, the brightness of each pixel is highly dependent on the drain current of the driving transistor, which imposes a stringent limitation on the time or temperature dependences of the μFE and Vth values. For example, a Vth shift of the driving transistor by 0.1 V causes an approximately 20% change in the resulting luminance of the OLED diodes\n[32, 68]. Thus, the BTS-induced Vth shift in ZnO-based transistors should be minimized. This stringent requirement also applies to the switching transistors for AM electronics, including the other display modes such as e-paper and LCDs, which is helpful to achieve a low power consumption and simple circuit design. For this reason, the device instability of oxide TFTs has been mainly examined under positive gate bias\n\n![6_image_0.png](6_image_0.png)\n\nstress (PBS) conditions corresponding to the on-state condition of the driving transistor.\n\nCross and coworkers found that ZnO TFTs exhibited a positive Vth shift of ∼25 V upon the application of PBS\n(VGS = 30 V, time = 104 s), as shown in figure 5(a)\n[69]. This positive Vth movement against the application of PBS can be explained by either charge trapping at the gate insulator/channel interface or charge injection into the gate dielectric bulk region. The difference between these two mechanisms is that the charge injection model requires a larger de-trapping energy barrier compared to the charge trapping model. The authors observed that the Vth value was recovered by more than 12 V after 15 min relaxation at room temperature, which suggests that the positiveVth movement can be attributed to charge trapping rather than charge injection. Similar charge trapping phenomena, including the fast recovery of Vth at room temperature, were reported in oxide TFTs with channel materials composed of an In2O3 film [70]. The charge trapping and subsequent redistribution of the trap charge in a deeper state can be described by the following stretch-exponential equation:\n\nequation.  $$\\Delta V_{\\rm th}(t)=V_{0}\\left\\{1-\\exp\\left[-\\left(\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right)^{\\beta}\\right]\\right\\},\\qquad V_{0}=V_{g}-V_{\\rm th,0}\\tag{1}$$\nwhere t is the time, τ is the relaxation time constant, β is the stretched-exponential exponent, and Vth,0 is the Vth before stress [71]. From the temperature-dependent Vth instability, a τ of ∼104 s at room temperature was extracted for IGZO\nTFTs [72]. It is noted that the relaxation time constants at room temperature for polycrystalline and amorphous Si TFTs were 1012 s and 107–109 s, respectively [71]. Thus, the stability of oxide TFTs can be concluded to be inferior to that of a-Si TFTs. The exact nature and physical implication of this have not been discussed in detail [72].\n\nOn the other hand, Suresh *et al* claimed that the charge injection model is responsible for the positive Vth movement under PBS conditions [73]. Given that the trap sites are uniformly distributed in the gate insulator, the total amount of injected charges can be given by the following equation, which is obtained by integrating over time and the thickness of the gate insulator having the trapping sites:\n\n$$Q(t)=\\int_{0}^{t}{\\rm d}t^{\\prime}\\int_{0}^{x}{\\rm d}x^{\\prime}N_{tr}\\varpi\\left(x^{\\prime}\\right)\\exp[-\\varpi\\left(x^{\\prime}\\right)t^{\\prime}]\\tag{2}$$\n\nwhere Ntr is the density of traps in the gate insulator and (x)\nis the time-independent tunneling probability. It can be shown that charge injection via the tunneling mechanism results in the following logarithmic dependence of the Vth shift:\n\n$$\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{th}}(t)=r_{0}\\log\\left({\\frac{t}{t_{0}}}\\right).$$\n\n$$({\\mathfrak{I}})$$\n. (3)\nFrom the fact that the Vth shift is linearly proportional to the logarithmic time (as shown in figure 5(b)), the degradation of IGZO TFTs was attributed to the charge injection involving the tunneling process of the channel carriers.\n\nExperimental evidence supporting the charge trapping or injection mechanism was recently reported by Moon *et al* [74].\n\nThey improved the bias stability of bottom gate amorphous IGZO TFTs by using oxygen (O2) plasma treatment on the SiNx gate insulator. The transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed out that the plasma treatment resulted in the formation of a thin silicon oxy-nitride (SiOxNy ) layer, while the untreated device has an interfacial silicate layer with a thickness of ∼5 nm at the SiNx /IGZO interface. The superior bias stability of the O2 plasma-treated device was ascribed to the stable interfacial SiOxNy layer. This result strongly indicates the importance of the properties of the interface between the gate insulator and oxide semiconductor, which is associated with the charge trapping or injection mechanism [74]. On the other hand, the creation of deep level traps in the\n\n 26  \n\n![7_image_0.png](7_image_0.png)\n\nIGZO channel was also proposed as a plausible origin for the Vth instability under PBS conditions. The unannealed TFTs suffered from a large Vth shift (>10 V) and degradation of the SS value after the application of PBS, which was attributed to the increase in the shallow trap state. In contrast, the wetannealed TFTs exhibited better electrical stability (Vth <\n2 V), which was explained by the increase in the number of deep charge defects based on the TFT simulation [75].\n\nThese assignments of the charge trapping, injection, or channel defect creation models as the origin of the Vth instability can also be understood in the framework of amorphous Si TFTs. However, the fundamental material difference between a-Si and ZnO-based oxide semiconductors should also be seriously considered: a-Si has strong covalent bonding due to its hybrid sp3 orbitals acting as a building unit, while ZnO-based oxide materials show ionic character due to the large difference in electro-negativity between the heavy metal cations and oxygen atoms. Indeed, ZnO-based thin films or bulk ceramics have been used as a sensor material for oxygen, NO2, or humidity (H2O), due to their extreme sensitivity [76, 77]. For this reason, the environmental instability has been investigated in detail. Kang *et al* reported the impact of oxygen adsorption on the IGZO back channel surface [78]. They fabricated bottom gate IGZO TFTs without any passivation layer, which means that the IGZO channel layer is directly exposed to the ambient atmosphere. It was found that the turn-on voltage (Von) of IGZO TFTs is greatly dependent on the O2 partial pressure of the ambient: Von was shifted negatively with decreasing O2 pressure, which indicates that the adsorbed oxygen molecules deplete the electron carriers of the IGZO channel layer due to the large electron negativity of the oxygen molecules. Although the oxygen molecules from the ambient can act as an acceptor, the water molecules were shown to act as either donor or acceptor-like traps depending on the screening length (λ),\nwhich is determined by the bulk trap density [79]. For IGZO\nTFTs with a relatively thick channel (tch > λ), the exposure of the un-passivated IGZO TFTs to water vapor caused the Vth value to shift negatively, which is the opposite behavior to that observed with O2 adsorption. In contrast, in the case of thinner channel devices (tch < λ), the dominance of the water-induced acceptor-like trap behavior was observed, which was attributed to the fact that the SS value is significantly deteriorated. The complex behavior of water molecules has also been reported in organic TFTs [80, 81].\n\nJeong *et al* studied the effect of the environmental ambient, including oxygen and water, on the gate bias stability of IGZO TFTs, as shown in figure 6(a) [82]. They modeled the oxygen adsorption by the following simple chemical reaction:\nO2(gas) + e− = 2O−(solid). (4)\nHere, the equilibrium constant K is given by [O−]solid/PO2[n],\nwhere [O−]solid, PO2 and [n] are the adsorbed oxygen concentration on the IGZO surface, the oxygen partial pressure and the electron density in the channel, respectively. If PO2 is increased in a vacuum probe system, the Vth of the resulting oxide TFT will be positively displaced, because the equilibrium constant K should be invariant at a fixed temperature and, as a result, the concentration of O−solid should increase according to 'Le Chatelier's principle' [78]. This principle is also valid when PBS is applied to oxide TFTs. As a result of the PBS, the accumulated electron density [n]\nin the channel region increases and the resulting adsorbate concentration of [O−solid] is also increased, giving rise to an increase in the Vth of the transistor, which is schematically shown in figure 6(b). The model of the gate electric field-induced oxygen adsorption as a possible origin for the positive Vth shift under PBS conditions was confirmed by the investigation of the oxygen pressure-dependent bias instability [83], and the influence of various ambient atmospheres including H2, O2 and air on the positive bias instability [84].\n\nLie *et al* revealed that the water adsorption dynamics play an important role in determining the negative Vth shift under NBS\nconditions, while the adsorption of oxygen molecules is largely responsible for the positive Vth shift under PBS conditions [85].\n\nIn other words, even though there is no charge trapping and/or injection, a positive Vth shift for unpassivated devices can be observed due to the interaction of the back oxide channel with the ambient. Therefore, the bias instability for unpassivated devices [69, 70, 72, 73, 75] should be carefully interpreted.\n\nOtherwise there is some possibility that the stability of the oxide semiconductor itself may be underestimated.\n\nThe temperature instability of ZnO-based oxide TFTs as well as their gate bias instability has also been studied independently, in order to evaluate the DOS distribution of the oxide semiconductor itself [86, 87] or to understand the limitation of their practical application [88]. Excellent bias stability was observed for oxide TFTs with a high-quality passivation layer [52]. Simultaneously, superior temperature stability was also achieved for such a device. Thus, it can be understood that the correlation between the gate bias instability and temperature instability stems from the lower total DOS\ndistribution, including the interfacial trap density (Nit) and bulk channel trap density (NSS) [89–91].\n\n## 3.2. Light-Enhanced Negative Bias Thermal Instability Of Oxide Tfts\n\nOne of the potential applications of ZnO-based TFTs reported in the literature is transparent electronics and/or AM displays, due to the wide band-gap of the channel layer; however, there has been no experimental verification of this. Very recently, there have been a few reports regarding the lightinduced bias instability of metal oxide TFTs, aiming at the implementation of oxide TFTs in high-end TFT-LCD panels, which have the largest market volume among the various AM\ndisplays. It is evident that the stability of oxide TFTs against backlight exposure should be guaranteed for this purpose. The exposure of the suitably passivated oxide TFT to visible light without any application of a gate and/or drain voltage resulted in a relatively small degradation of the Vth instability.\n\nFigure 7(a) shows the typical driving diagram of the driving\n\n![8_image_0.png](8_image_0.png)\n\nvoltage for TFT-LCD displays. The ratio of the turn-on time\n(∼21 μs) to the turn-off time (∼16.7 ms) during one frame time is approximately 0.001. Thus, the negative bias thermal instability (NBTI) is much more stringent than the positive bias thermal instability (PBTI) under light illumination. This light-induced bias instability is also important for flexible displays, because transmissive (OLED) and reflective (Epaper) display devices are adversely affected by self-emitting light and ambient sunlight, respectively.\n\nThe effect of the combination of photo and bias stress on the device instability of ZnO TFTs was studied for ZnO TFTs, which have an atomic layer deposition (ALD)-derived Al2O3 film as the gate insulator [92]. It was tentatively suggested that photo-generated hole trapping at the channel/gate dielectric or gate dielectric bulk film is responsible for the huge negative Vth shift under light-illuminated NBS conditions. Lee *et al* investigated the impact of moisture on the photon-enhanced NBTI in IGZO TFTs. It was found that the negative Vth shift was accelerated by increasing the relative humidity under negative bias thermal illumination stress (NBTIS) conditions\n[93]. Based on the hole trapping model, water related molecules may act as electron trap centers, resulting in the enhancement of the creation rate of electron–hole pairs by photon excitation. Thus, the increase in the number of hole carriers at the gate insulator/channel interface is thought to be responsible for the acceleration of the negative Vth shift.\n\nAn entirely different mechanism has also been proposed for Al–Sn–Zn–In–O TFTs [94]. It was found that, in the case of unpassivated oxide TFTs, the photo-induced desorption of oxygen molecules on the back channel surface is responsible for the large negative Vth shift under NBTIS conditions. This result suggests that preventing the NBTIS-induced instability of oxide TFTs requires the same passivation layer as that used for the BTS-induced instability. Notably, theoretical calculations were attempted to reveal the origin of the light-\n\n![9_image_0.png](9_image_0.png)\n\ntrapping model [95].\n\n## 4. Application Of Oxide Tfts Into Active Matrix Display\n\nThere have been several pioneering reports regarding oxide TFT-driven E-paper and OLED displays. Toppan Printing Inc. reported 4 full-color QVGA e-paper driven by IGZO TFTs on a PEN plastic substrate [40]. The sputtered-deposited SiOxNy film was utilized as a gate insulator and passivation layer for the bottom gate IGZO TFTs. The μFE, Vth and Ion/off ratio were 6 cm2 (Vs)−1, 1.6 V, and >104, respectively. First, an IGZO-TFT driven 3.5 QCIF+ (176 × 220 pixels) AMOLED\ndisplay was fabricated by LG Electronics Inc, as shown in figure 8. An oxide TFT with top gate configuration and OLED with top emission were employed and the unit pixel was two transistors plus one capacitor. [37]. A prototype of the 3.5 flexible AMOLED with the same resolution was also demonstrated on a stainless steel foil (panel thickness\n∼1 mm). The fabricated IGZO TFTs exhibited a μFE of 6.7 cm2 (Vs)−1, SS of 0.61 V/decade, and Ion/off ratio of 3.5 × 105 [96]. Samsung SDI reported the fabrication of a 12.1 WXGA AMOLED using sputtered IGZO TFTs on a glass substrate [38]. The device performance was improved by optimizing the channel and passivation layer, as compared to the previously reported ones [37, 40]. Thus, the IGZO TFTs had a μFE of 17.0 cm2 (Vs)−1, SS of 0.28 V/decade, Vth of 1.8 V, and Ion/off ratio of 2.0 × 109. Park *et al* reported a prototype transparent 2.5 AMOLED on a glass substrate, which is driven by ALD-deposited ZnO TFTs with a top gate structure [97]. The fabricated ZnO TFTs exhibited reasonable device performance with a μFE of 4 cm2 (Vs)−1 and Ion/off ratio of 107.\n\nA full-color 6.5 flexible AMOLED on a plastic substrate was recently demonstrated by Samsung mobile displays, as shown in figure 9 [42], which demonstrated the possibility of using oxide TFTs as the backplane for OLED devices.\n\n8\n\n## 5. Conclusions\n\nDue to their superior device properties and low fabrication cost comparable to those of their a-Si counterpart, metal oxide TFTs have the potential to be incorporated into commercial flat panel displays, such as AMLCD and AMOLED displays.\n\nIn flexible AM displays, metal oxide TFTs will still be a strong competitor, due to their large-area scalability and low temperature capability. However, the following technical challenge should be overcome in order to exploit the advantage of oxide TFTs. The low-temperature process compatible with plastic substrates essentially involves the creation of a large defect density in the gate insulator, semiconductor and passivation layer. The large trap density resulting from the low-temperature process would negatively impact the stability of the devices, including their temperature, bias and light stability, as well as their device performance, such as their mobility and contact resistance. Therefore, besides searching for a killer application for flexible displays and improving the manufacturing techniques, a significant amount of fundamental research still remains to be done, which includes the exploration of novel materials with high mobility and stability and understanding the deterioration mechanism of oxide TFTs against electrical and light stress.\n\nIn addition, flexible OLED displays require high quality encapsulation, because the lifetime of the organic emitting diodes is significantly reduced by the attack of moisture and oxygen molecules. Thus, thin film encapsulation techniques should also be simultaneously developed to meet the stringent requirements of flexible applications.\n\n## Acknowledgment\n\nThis work was supported by an Inha University Research Grant.\n\n## References\n\n[1] Afentakis T, Hatalis M K, Voutsas A T and Hartzell J W 2003 Proc.

The transistors are used in established applications such as fat-panel displays and X-ray detectors, and are of potential use in a range of emerging applications. Here we discuss the development of TFTs for large-area electronics. We explore the use of TFTs—which can be based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon, low-temperature polycrystalline silicon, amorphous oxide semiconductors and organic semiconductors—in displays and sensors, as well as digital circuits and memory. We also consider their potential use in emerging applications such as neuromorphic computing.\n\n## Operation Of Tfts And Mosfets\n\nTFTs are a type of field-effect transistor with a metal–insulator–\nsemiconductor architecture that is similar to that of the traditional metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) used in complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) technologies1. \n\nTypically, MOSFETs have a monocrystalline semiconductor channel and are grown on silicon wafers, whereas TFTs often have an amorphous or polycrystalline semiconductor channel and are grown on insulating substrates such as glass or flexible substrates. MOSFETs are used for high-frequency computing and signal processing, whereas TFTs operate at lower frequencies and are better suited to large-area applications.\n\nIn a MOSFET, the transistor channel has a regular arrangement of atoms in a crystalline structure, which makes its energy band well defined (Fig. 1). Applying a bias to the gate (G) causes charge inversion to occur at the interface, and the charge transport relies on minority carriers (that is, with opposite polarity to the semiconductor type). In a TFT, however, the irregular arrangement of atoms in a non-crystalline structure forms continuous energy band with band tails, and there is no well-defined boundary between the conduction band (CB) and the valence band (VB) (Fig. 1). The energy bandgap (Eg) is instead defined by mobility edges. Therefore, charges can accumulate, and charge transport relies on the majority carriers of the semiconductor. \n\nLarge-area electronics involves devices, circuits and systems that cover large areas on substrates such as glass or flexible films. Array densities can range from five devices per inch for touch sensors to 3,000 devices per inch for near-eye displays in augmented and virtual reality applications. For decades, thin-film transistors (TFTs) have been used in large-area displays and X-ray imagers due to their ability to be fabricated on insulating substrates at low cost and with high uniformity. As display technology has improved, so has the mobility, switching speed, leakage current and power consumption of TFTs. With these developments, TFTs have the potential to be used in a range of non-display applications.\n\nIn this Review, we explore the development of TFT technologies, including those based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H), \nlow-temperature polycrystalline silicon (LTPS), amorphous oxide semiconductors (AOSs) and organic semiconductors (OSs). We first examine the use of TFTs as switches in displays and image sensors, as current sources in displays, as transimpedance amplifiers and low-noise sensor interfaces, and as direct sensors. We then examine their use in digital circuits and memory, and in neuromorphic computing as well. We consider how the technical requirements for the TFTs vary with different applications, and what engineering challenges remain before emerging non-display applications can be realized.\n\n1 State Key Laboratory of Microelectronic Devices and Integrated Technology, Institute of Microelectronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China. \n\n2 State Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Materials and Technologies, Guangdong Province Key Laboratory of Display Material and Technology, School of Electronics and Information Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China. 3ES&S, COSIC, ESAT, KU Leuven, Diepenbeek, Belgium. 4Darwin College, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK. 5Advanced Display Research Center, Department of Information Display, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, South Korea. 6Thin Film Nano and Microelectronics Research Laboratory, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA. 7These authors contributed equally: Di Geng, Kai Wang.  e-mail: lingli@ime.ac.cn; liuming@ime.ac.cn\n\n![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)\n\nThus, in contrast to a MOSFET, the TFT can be regarded as a junctionless device. Ohmic contacts are formed between the source (S)/drain (D) \nand channel, replacing the p–n junctions in the MOSFET.\n\nDue to the amorphous properties of indium gallium zinc oxide \n(IGZO) and hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H; Fig. 1), the electrical performance of the resulting TFT is less sensitive to variations in trap and defect density. For example, in the a-Si:H TFT, the charge carriers conduct in the channel by dangling bond-induced localized sites. The carrier mean free path or hopping range is comparable to the lattice constant (approximately a few nanometres) and much shorter than the channel length (approximately several micrometres). Therefore, the field-effect mobility of amorphous TFTs tends to converge and shows less variation over a large area. This characteristic is critical for large-area applications requiring high electrical uniformity, such as in displays and large-area sensor arrays.\n\nHowever, the amorphous structure of the TFT channel also inevitably results in the formation of defect states at the semiconductor/ insulator interface due to lattice disorder, dangling bonds or chemical bonds dissociating/forming at the semiconductor surface during fabrication. These can trap carriers and reduce the carrier mobility and output current. Thus, several processes have been developed to reduce defect states. For example, oxygen plasma treatment can effectively oxidize the dangling bonds and reduce the number of deep energy level states2. Thermal annealing in vacuum, air or oxygen can decrease the number of interface trap sites3. In addition to reduced trap and defect densities, adoption of a suitable gate insulator is critical to achieving high device performance. A low density of interface states between the insulator and channel layers is particularly important. The a-Si:H TFT \nuses silicon nitride (SiNx) as a gate insulator (GI), which is deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD). The material is electrically and thermodynamically stable and forms a good interface with a-Si:H, resulting in a leakage current of ~1 × 10−13 A. Similarly, PECVD-derived SiO2 or a SiNx/SiO2 stack are used in low-temperature polycrystalline silicon and oxide TFTs due to the low interface state density4.\n\nRecently, emerging applications for TFTs have demanded that they function with lower operating voltages, reduced power consumption, enhanced field-effect mobility and improved subthreshold slope5. \n\nHigh-κ dielectric materials (where κ is the dielectric constant) have been researched for achieving higher gate capacitance per unit area6. \n\nUsing a high-κ dielectric improves gate controllability, reduces the operating voltage and prevents quantum tunnelling of carriers (which can occur when the dielectric is extremely thin)7. Other approaches have been to use ultrathin dielectrics8 and self-assembled monolayers9, although these can be costly when manufactured over a large area.\n\nSwitches in displays and image sensors TFTs found their first widespread application in large-area electronics as switches in active-matrix liquid-crystal displays (AMLCDs)10, where a TFT and a storage capacitor form a one-transistor–one-capacitor (1T1C) \ncircuit to drive an LCD pixel (shown schematically in Fig. 2a). Compared to digital logic and computing circuits, a pixel driving circuit controlling an LCD pixel has lower speed and latency requirements. Therefore, disordered semiconductors can be used in the TFTs forming the 1T1C \ncircuit. TFTs are used in AMLCDs because of their switching performance, but they are also economically favourable because disordered \n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)\n\nsemiconductor thin films can be manufactured uniformly and reproducibly over large-area glass substrates at a low thermal budget and at low cost, mainly due to the fewer number of manufacturing steps compared to monocrystalline silicon manufacturing. The glass substrate size can be easily scaled up compared with traditional monocrystalline silicon semiconductor substrates, leading to a large cost-per-unit-area advantage. Glass substrate sizes have been introduced in several generations, from Generation 1 (300 mm × 400 mm) in 1990 to Generation 11 (2,940 mm × 3,370 mm) in 2018.\n\nEmerging display technologies, such as those based on organic light-emitted diodes (OLEDs)11,12 or micro-LEDs, require pixel driving circuits, and thus TFTs, with higher performance. In particular, improving the display resolution in mobile devices and high-definition televisions require TFTs with higher charge carrier mobility, electrical stability and performance uniformity13–15. It has become challenging for a-Si:H TFTs to meet these requirements because of their large parasitic capacitance, low bias stability and low carrier mobility15. It is also desirable for displays to reduce power consumption and lengthen the standby time by using low-voltage driving and increasing the transmittance of each pixel, respectively. To maximize the aperture ratio of a pixel for higher transmittance, stricter design rules must be implemented that minimize the size of storage capacitors and TFTs.\n\nAs an alternative to a-Si:H, LTPS has a charge carrier mobility that is ~200 times higher due to the long-range order of its atomic structure. Additionally, self-aligned structures have been demonstrated in LTPS TFTs, which reduce parasitic capacitance. This can increase the operation speed and reduce the driving power consumption. The improvement in current per unit area compared to a-Si:H TFTs also allows for a smaller TFT and thus pixels with a higher aperture ratio, reducing backlight power consumption. Last, a narrower bezel can be achieved if driver and multiplex circuits are made on panels using downscaled LTPS processes and self-aligned structures.\n\nOne issue with LTPS TFTs is low uniformity due to irregular polysilicon grains. Scalability and yield are also challenging issues to be resolved, especially for large-size display panels. Amorphous oxides, such as IGZO, have carrier mobilities approximately one to two orders of magnitude higher than a-Si:H, as well as extremely low leakage currents (down to 50 yA µm−1; ref. 16). Its amorphous nature provides a better uniformity than LTPS, and its scalability is similar to that of a-Si TFTs. Mass-produced IGZO TFT panels have already been used to make high-resolution AMLCDs. The production costs of amorphous oxide semiconductor TFTs are lower than those of LTPS TFTs while having reasonable performance sufficient for the needs of emerging display applications.\n\nTable 1 compares the mainstream TFT technologies for display applications. Because the development of TFTs is largely driven by the display industry, considerations of application requirements, performance, cost and mass production must be balanced so that both the technical and economical requirements for a display application are met.\n\nDisplays are expected to work for a long time. Long-term electrical stress can cause instability in TFTs over time, resulting in shifts in the threshold voltage and transfer characteristics. The threshold voltage shift can be in a positive (positive bias stress, PBS) or negative (negative bias stress, NBS) direction (Fig. 3a). The electrical instability is associated with traps and defects in the channel and at the interface. Several strategies have been developed to improve stability: for example, in IGZO TFTs, changes of the composition17,18, defect reduction19 or the adoption of double channel layers17,20\n(Fig. 3b–d). Mitigation strategies for bias stressing should also account for their potential impacts on charge carrier mobility, resulting in a mobility–stability trade-off. Reducing defects and using a double channel generally results in improved electrical stability while minimizing the loss of carrier mobility.\n\nTFTs as switches are also used in large-area X-ray imagers and optical fingerprint scanners21–23. In addition to having high uniformity over large areas, TFTs are advantageous for X-ray imagers due to their improved high-energy radiation hardness24. Large-area X-ray imagers are essentially large-area flat-panel photodetectors overlaid with an X-ray scintillator, such as caesium iodide. X-rays, unlike visible light, cannot be focused using lens optics, and imaging large sections of the human body therefore requires a sufficiently large-area panel that can image the body in one shot to reduce radiation exposure. \n\nLarge-area flat-panel photodetectors are fully compatible with display Table 1 | Comparison of performances of the main TFT technologies\n\n| Table 1 | Comparison of performances of the main TFT technologies TFT type a-Si:H LTPS   | AOS                      | Organic                           |                            |                                  |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Fabrication process                                                                      | Chemical vapour          | Laser annealing and               | Oxide sputtering           | Printing and evaporation         |\n| deposition                                                                               | crystallization          |                                   |                            |                                  |\n| Mask count                                                                               | 4 to 5                   | 7 (pMOS) to 9 (CMOS)              | 4 (back channel etch) to   | Not applicable                   |\n| 8 (coplanar)                                                                             |                          |                                   |                            |                                  |\n| TFT structure                                                                            | Bottom-gate stagger      | Top-gate self‐aligned coplanar    | Stagger and top-gate       | Stagger and coplanar             |\n| self‐aligned coplanar                                                                    |                          |                                   |                            |                                  |\n| Process temperature (°C)                                                                 | 250–350                  | 350–550                           | 30–350                     | <130                             |\n| Substrate size (mm × mm)                                                                 | Gen. 11 (2,940 × 3,370)  | Gen. 6 (1,500 × 1,800)            | Gen. 8.5 (2,200 × 2,500)   | Gen. 4 (730 × 920)               |\n| Mobility (cm2  V−1 s−1)                                                                  | 0.5                      | ~100                              | ~10                        | ~1                               |\n| Subthreshold slope (mV dec−1)                                                            | 400–500                  | 200–300                           | 90–200                     | 50–2,000                         |\n| Leakage current (A)                                                                      | 10−13                    | 10–12                             | ≪10–14 (measurement limit) | 10−13–10−11                      |\n| Stress stability                                                                         | Worse (ΔVth > 10 V)      | Good (ΔVth < 1 V)                 | Medium (ΔVth < 5 V)        | Poor (ΔVth > 5 V)                |\n| TFT uniformity σ (s.d.)                                                                  | Good (σ < 0.3)           | Medium (σ < 0.5)                  | Very good (σ < 0.2)        | -                                |\n| Circuit integration                                                                      | nMOS                     | CMOS                              | nMOS                       | pMOS                             |\n| Advantages                                                                               | Large process margin and | High mobility (~100 cm2  V−1 s−1) | a‐Si like process and      | Low process temperatures         |\n| scalability                                                                              | and excellent stability  | scalability                       |                            |                                  |\n| Disadvantages                                                                            | Low mobility, poor Vth   | Narrow laser process margin;

The flat-panel imager requires an array of TFTs to perform active-matrix switching and address each pixel. Each pixel therefore has a TFT switch to address a photodetector unit for readout, normally a photodiode (PD). The technical requirements are similar to those of pixel driving in displays. \n\nTherefore, the transition from TFT production for display panels to X-ray detector panels is relatively straightforward. These flat-panel detectors can be used for projection radiography or as an alternative to an X-ray image intensifier, where a photodetector device is integrated with a switching TFT to form a passive pixel sensor \n(PPS)22 (Fig. 2c). Optical fingerprint scanners can also be formed by PD-integrated TFT switch arrays23. In imaging applications, leakage current is a key performance factor for achieving low noise and a high frame rate. Wide-bandgap oxide semiconductor-based TFTs, which have the lowest off-state current of the main TFT technologies \n(Table 1), are therefore used for large-area image sensors and fingerprint scanners23,25.\n\n## Tft As A Current Source In Displays\n\nActive-matrix organic light-emitting diode (AMOLED) displays, unlike AMLCDs, are current-driven devices that require the driver TFT to serve as a current source and maintain a stable output current. Initially, LTPS TFTs in a two-transistor and one-capacitor (2T1C) pixel circuit were used, where one TFT acts as a current source and the other as a switch. However, the display image quality is directly related to the output current uniformity of the driving TFTs, and it is challenging to obtain good current uniformity using a single TFT as a current source. \n\nTogether with the instability issues of LTPS, the conventional 2T1C \ncircuit is no longer used in AMOLED products.\n\nThus, a circuit with multiple TFTs is needed to compensate for the non-uniform threshold voltage (Vth) and grain-dependent electron mobility of LTPS TFTs and thus increase uniformity in the display image. A typical in-pixel compensation circuit consists of five to seven TFTs and one to two capacitors26. Figure 2b shows the widely used seven-transistor and one-capacitor (7T1C) pixel circuit. One TFT is the switch in connection with the scan lines, and the other TFTs function together to provide a stable and compensated current source to the AMOLED pixel27. In-pixel or internal compensation adds complexity to the pixel and results in a lower fill factor and stress-induced instability issue, so external compensation methods have been implemented28. \n\nHowever, this requires external integrated circuits (ICs) and computation, which increases the system complexity and power consumption in a panel.\n\nTransimpedance amplifier and low-noise sensor interface In image sensor applications, the traditional PPS has a limited signal-to-noise ratio. To enhance it, an active pixel sensor (APS; Fig. \n\n2d) has been proposed, especially for low-dose X-ray imaging and in-display fingerprint recognition where the incident radiation is generally weak29,30. Similar to the APS in CMOS image sensors, it generally needs multiple transistors (three TFTs) to fulfil the functions of reset, integration and read. The key component in the circuit is a TFT-based source follower or transimpedance amplifier, which amplifies the signal at the pixel level and/or reduces the noise. To improve the signal-to-noise ratio, such a TFT must be designed with a high channel width-to-length ratio. Meanwhile, the TFT APS enables correlated double sampling for noise reduction, similar to the CMOS APS.\n\nThe critical dimension of TFT processes is generally in the range of 2–3 µm, which is much larger than that of CMOS processes. As a result, the fill factor of the PD generally decreases with an increasing number of components in a pixel, and the sensitivity is decreased due to a reduction in the photosensing area. There is therefore a trade-off between high spatial resolution and high sensitivity in TFT-based APSs. \n\nThe simplest approach to resolving this is to reduce the number of components in the pixel. An alternative approach is a full fill-factor pixel where the PD is fabricated over the top of the TFTs. However, inter-layer stress and inter-pixel crosstalk are disadvantages31.\n\nAnother emerging use of TFT-based amplifiers is to enhance weak sensory signals at the sensor interface between the local pixel/unit of the large-area sensor array and the external silicon-based CMOS \nreadout/peripheral electronics. One strategy is to reduce the flicker \n\n \n\n![4_image_0.png](4_image_0.png)\n\nin the interface/insulator (c) and adoption of a double channel (d). The TFT was biased at a gate–source voltage, VGS, of ±30 V for a total of 10,000 s, and TFT transfer curves were measured at a drain–source voltage, VDS, of 0.1 V. The TFTs were fabricated using the standard back channel-etch processes80. Panels b and d adapted with permission from ref. 17, Springer Nature Ltd.\n\nnoise in the TFT by increasing the TFT size. Other demonstrations use a chopper-stabilized amplifier to enhance the working frequency32 and a low-noise pseudo-CMOS TFT amplifier for measuring electrocardiograms33. A low-noise TFT amplifier can also be achieved by operating it in the subthreshold regime. For example, Schottky-barrier TFTs have been developed for ultralow-power sensor interfaces with high transconductance efficiency and high intrinsic gain34–36. In the array-type sensor, where a weak signal needs to be amplified and read out sequentially, an array of interface circuits has been implemented with a 2T1C interface circuit based on a-Si:H TFTs37.\n\n## Tft As Direct Sensors\n\nUnlike a traditional self-aligned top-gate MOSFET configuration, a TFT can be designed into four different device architectures depending on the process sequence for the semiconductor channel, dielectric and metal contacts. Thus, it can offer great design flexibility over a MOSFET in sensor architectures where drain sensing, gate sensing, channel semiconductor sensing and gate dielectric sensing can be utilized38,39. Additionally, TFTs are compatible with additive manufacturing approaches, allowing facile and sequential process integration through layer-by-layer deposition and patterning at a low thermal budget.\n\nTFTs as photosensors have been reported by using photosensitive materials40, extending the channel38 and forming a three-dimensional channel structure39. In all these examples, the semiconducting channel was either an a-Si:H or oxide semiconductor that inherently served as a photon absorber. The advantage of TFT-based photosensors is that they enable sensing, amplification and readout by incorporating more circuitry functions in one TFT device through the use of a dual-gate design30. Other examples of TFT-based direct sensors include pH sensors that detect ion-induced potential via an organic TFT (OTFT)41, tactile sensors that integrate a piezoelectric transducer with a TFT42, electrochemical sensors based on TFTs that detect biomolecules with no labels43, TFT-based gas sensors44 and memory-integrated-photosensitive TFTs45. Compared with microelectromechanical system (MEMS) and CMOS sensors, the cost per unit area can be much lower if large-area manufacturing is adopted for TFT sensors. However, the repeatability, reliability and stability of TFT-based sensors remains a challenging issue that needs to be addressed.\n\n## Tft-Based Digital Circuits\n\nLarge-area displays typically require that a single panel is integrated with CMOS ICs for conditioning or signal handling through flexible printed circuitry or chips on glass. As the number of external ICs increases for high-resolution displays, metal routing and interconnects become more difficult to achieve and require precise and costly modular processes. One approach to avoid this issue is to also create these functional circuits using TFTs, leading to a system on panels46. \n\nGate-on-array (GOA) technology that replaces CMOS gate drivers with LTPS TFT-based drivers can achieve higher resolution, higher compactness and smaller bezel sizes47. GOA is essentially an array of shift registers used to sequentially provide the voltage for gating the TFTs. Complementary LTPS TFTs have typically become the first choice due to their relatively high mobility compared with other TFTs. However, n-LTPS TFTs have high leakage currents, unsuitable for some display applications, especially those requiring low power consumption and long battery lifetime, such as smartphone and wearable displays. Low-temperature polycrystalline oxide (LTPO) technology, which combines p-type LTPS and n-type IGZO TFTs, has therefore been developed48,49. This combination is possible because of the relatively small performance mismatch of the two TFT types. Because a-IGZO TFTs have a lower thermal budget than LTPS TFTs, they are processed after the LTPS TFTs. The process compatibility, cost-effectiveness and large-area capability make LTPO technology attractive for making integrated systems on a panel/foil50.\n\nThe improvements of digital circuits made with TFTs for use as peripheral circuits in displays have driven their application in other functional circuits and systems, such as field-programmable gate arrays51, microcontrollers52 and central processing units53,54. For compatibility with large-area integration technologies, TFT-based memory55, input/output circuits and circuit interfaces between CMOS ICs and sensors/displays56 have also been reported. However, some TFT \ntechnologies lack a complementary pair of polarity types for realizing robust and low-power circuits. Therefore, pseudo-CMOS-type circuits have been proposed57,58, and a library of TFT-based circuit building blocks has also been established to create more complicated circuit designs59,60.\n\nImproved TFT performance enables the design of high-frequency circuits on low-loss large-area substrates, such as glass or flexible polymers. For example, an amplitude-shift keying (ASK) demodulator for radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags has been demonstrated using complementary LTPS TFT technology61. LTPS TFTs are favoured due to their ambipolarity for forming complementary circuits and their self-assembly for high-speed manufacture. The demodulator operates at a carrier frequency of 13.56 MHz and has a peak data rate of 100 kbit s−1. A similar circuit demonstration has been shown using AOS TFTs62. An a-IGZO-based unipolar near-field communication tag has demonstrated direct clock division at 13.56 MHz. The tag, which is compatible with the ISO standard, could be used for direct readout in a commercial smartphone63. This clock division circuit was then used as a building block for a time-to-digital converter in a fully IGZO-based electrocardiogram patch64.\n\nIn addition to circuits made using amorphous IGZO, TFTs made using a crystalline version of IGZO—c-axis aligned crystalline IGZO (CAAC-IGZO)—has demonstrated a low off-state current65. \n\nUsing 800-nm node CMOS FETs and CAAC-IGZO TFTs prepared at the back-end-of-line, a 1-Mbit non-volatile oxide semiconductor random-access memory was demonstrated16. Charge retention was shown for ~60 days at 85 °C after the power was shut off, due to the low off-state current of the TFT. Such performance characteristics make oxide semiconductor TFTs attractive for applications where low power consumption is a requirement. In addition, an integration process between n-type CAAC-IGZO TFTs and p-type LTPS TFTs or MOSFETs has been proposed66. An 8-bit processor has been demonstrated using 800-nm CMOS FETs integrated with 3.0-µm CAAC-IGZO FETs67, and a normally-off central processing unit (CPU) has been demonstrated using 60-nm node CAAC-IGZO TFTs and 65-nm node silicon MOSFETs with an 86% reduction of power consumption compared to a CMOS \ncounterpart68.\n\nNeuromorphic engineering and artificial intelligence In the nervous system, neurons and synapses are the two fundamental components, forming a spiking neural network that performs biological computation. Inspired by biological neurons and synapses, artificial devices have been developed that emulate their functionality and signal processing. TFTs are being explored as a platform for neuromorphic devices. Multi-terminal TFTs based on organic semiconductors69, oxide semiconductors70 and two-dimensional materials71 have been reported that handle multiple spike-like inputs and thus act as synapses. Compared with synaptic circuits consisting of several CMOS transistors and one capacitor, a single TFT with multiple inputs can be a much simpler approach to making electronic synapses. However, stability and reliability are critical issues to be addressed before full implementation in neuromorphic engineering72. In addition, TFT-based synapses have challenges in obtaining high performance and fidelity.\n\nConventionally, artificial intelligence algorithms and computation are performed by CMOS peripheral electronics. A potential advantage of TFT circuits is a reduction in the number of heterogeneous interfaces between TFT-based large-area distributed sensors and CMOS-based ICs. Several TFT-based circuits used to perform feature extraction and classification tasks from image data from large-area electronic sensors have been designed73. However, due to the low electrical performance of TFTs, a much weaker classifier was obtained but with higher data redundancy. To enhance the classifier performance, a TFT-based classifier could be combined with a CMOS-based strong classifier. More recently, a flexible, metal–oxide TFT-based classification circuit for odour recognition and classification has been reported74.\n\n## Outlook\n\nTFTs are crucial building blocks for various display and non-display applications. Figure 4 presents examples of TFT developments in non-display applications over the past decade or so in logic and memory, RFID and RF switches, and sensors. It is likely that TFT technology will remain predominantly used in displays, but the breadth of research activity suggests that uses in emerging applications will also grow in the future.\n\nTFT-based sensors and sensor interfaces, wearable and flexible electronics, computing/memory and RF devices will have their own TFT performance requirements (Table 2). TFT-based sensor interfaces, currently in the development stage, are likely to be the first to become commercially available in applications that prioritize form factor and power consumption. Analogue front-end, memory and neuromorphic devices have higher requirements and are expected to take a longer time to come to market. Some applications, such as human–machine interfaces, wearable electronics and flexible electronics, trade off low sampling rate, data transmission rate and storage capacity in exchange for flexible form factors and low power consumption. Here, TFTs can potentially have a major role when integrating devices, circuits and system blocks.\n\nTFTs have also become a test vehicle for new materials and processes due to their design flexibility and ease of processing.

However, large-area fabrication and integration of these materials on glass and foil substrates remains challenging, and issues related to reliability and stability for long-term usage remain. Given the high barrier to the entry of new materials and processes in the electronic devices manufacturing industry, these concerns of scalability and manufacturing compatibility mean that mature materials (a-Si:H, LTPS and AOS) are still favoured for many emerging applications.\n\n![6_image_0.png](6_image_0.png)\n\nIoT Memory Logic\n\n![6_image_1.png](6_image_1.png)\n\nFig. 4 | Representative works in non-display applications of TFTs. Development of TFTs for display applications have led to TFTs that can be applied in sensors25[,39[,41[,44[,81[,82, flexible RFID tags57,83–86, memory16,87–89 and logic technology51,54,90. IoT, Internet of Things. Images reproduced with permission Sensor The integration of TFT-based sensors, imagers and analogue front-end circuits with CMOS-based logic and memory for signal processing demands further exploration. Over a long period of time, CMOS and TFT have independently worked to enable hybrid integration for large-area electronics using bonding or packaging processes. The inferior performance of TFTs compared to MOSFETs means that they are limited to displays and sensors. For example, to make TV displays and X-ray image sensors, TFT arrays are integrated with CMOS driver ICs and readout ICs (ROICs) through bonding processes to form functional modules. With aggressive demands for narrow bezels, particularly in mobile displays, and small/flexible form factors in IoTs, and also thanks to a substantial improvement in TFT performance, integrability between TFT and CMOS is trending to be more monolithic, either on or in the same substrate77.\n\nHowever, the lack of a good p-channel TFT has become yet another barrier to application in large-scale integrated circuits. Only very recently it has been shown that integration of a p-type MOSFET and an n-type IGZO TFT can successfully form memory cells78, which suggests there is potential for further developments in this area. In the future, we could see a convergence of CMOS-based large-scale integrated electronics and TFT-based large-area electronics, provided there exists the right application (edge computing, for example) and sufficient market forces to drive the necessary developments.\n\n## References\n\n1.

Weng Abstract—The authors report the deposition of amorphous indium-gallium-oxide (a-IGO) films on glass substrate by co-sputtering and the fabrication of thin film transistors (TFTs) with a-IGO bilayer channel. It was found that the electron mobility, μFE, sub-threshold swing, SS, and Ion/Ioff ratio of the fabricated TFTs were all better than those reported **previously** from the TFTs with single a-IGO channel. By properly controlling the sputtering powers, we achieved TFTs with μFE of 53.2 cm2**/Vs,** SS of 0.19 V/decade, and Ion/Ioff **ratio of ~107**. \n\nIndex Terms—IGO, bilayer, TFTs, amorphous\n\n## I. Introduction\n\nMORPHOUS oxide semiconductors (AOSs) have attracted much attention in recent years. These AOSs are cost effective and could be deposited with good large area uniformity. With high transparency and high electron mobility, μFE, AOSs are particularly useful as the channel material of thin film transistors (TFTs) [1-3]. Previously, it has been shown that one can use the bilayer channel to enhance the performances of AOS TFTs [4]. Compared with TFTs with single AOS channel, it has been reported that TFTs with bilayer channel could provide larger μFE and larger Ion/Ioff ratio. It has also been shown that the bilayer TFTs could provide better photo-stability and lower current normalized noise spectral density [4]. Previously, Jeon et al. proposed the use of indium-zinc oxide \n(IZO)/indium-gallium-zinc oxide (IGZO) bilayer as the channel material of the TFTs and achieved high µFE of ~30 cm2/V-s and high Ion/Ioff of 1×1010 [5]. Kim et al. also achieved high performance TFTs using IZO/hafnium-indium-zinc-oxide (HIZO) bilayer as the channel material [6]. \n\n(InxGa1-x)2O3 or IGO is an interesting material system. It is known that bandgap energy of single crystalline β-Ga2O3 is \n~4.9 eV. With wide direct bandgap, both crystalline and amorphous Ga2O3 can be used for solar-blind ultraviolet photo sensing [7, 8]. By alloying Ga2O3 with In2O3 to form IGO, we can adjust the bandgap energy from 4.9 eV to 3.4 eV. It should be noted that IGO is more transparent, particular in the blue and green spectral regions, as compared to other AOSs [9]. Using rf-sputtering, Chiang et al. demonstrated the fabrication of an AOS TFT with a-IGO channel [10]. Yu et al. reported the fabrication of AOS TFTs with In2O3/IGO bilayer channel [4]. However, their TFTs were prepared by solution processes. This could result in poor film quality. Indeed, the ∼2.6 cm2/Vs µFE\nachieved from their bilayer TFTs was significantly smaller than A\nthose achieved from the bilayer TFTs prepared by physical vapor deposition (PVD) [5, 6]. \n\nVery recently, we reported the co-sputtering of IGO films and the fabrication of IGO UV phototransistors [11]. By adjusting the sputtering power of the In2O3 target, we changed the indium content and the bandgap energy of the deposited IGO films. However, no report on the fabrication of TFTs with \n(InxGa1-x)2O3/(InyGa1-y)2O3 bilayer channel could be found in the literature. It should be noted that three sputtering targets are required to prepare the previously reported TFTs with IZO/IGZO or IZO/HIZO bilayer channel [5, 6]. In contrast, only two sputtering targets are needed to prepare the TFTs with \n(InxGa1-x)2O3/(InyGa1-y)2O3 bilayer channel [11]. Thus, we should be able to control the composition ratio in the AOS\nlayers more precisely. It should be noted that although In2O3 could provide high mobility, it crystallizes easily [4]. Thus, only IGO was used as the channel material in this study. \n\n## Ii. Experiments\n\nSamples used in this study were all deposited on glass substrate by co-sputtering using Ga2O3 and In2O3 targets at room temperature [8, 11]. Fig. 1(a) shows schematic diagram of the fabricated TFTs. To fabricate these devices, the bottom gate Al electrode was first deposited by thermal evaporation through a shadow mask. A 200-nm-thick SiO2 gate dielectric layer was subsequently deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition. A 10-nm-thick IGO front channel layer was then deposited. During front channel deposition, the rf powers of the Ga2O3 and In2O3 targets were fixed at 90 and 60 Watt, respectively. A 40-nm-thickness IGO back channel layer was subsequently deposited. During back channel deposition, the rf power of the Ga2O3 target was kept at 100 Watt while the rf power of the In2O3 target was fixed at 40, 50, and 60 Watt for device A, device B, and device C, respectively. Finally, the Al source and drain electrodes were deposited through another shadow mask. These three devices were then thermally annealed at 200°C for 60 min. During annealing, O2 was introduced into the furnace with a flow rate of 50 sccm. \n\nIt should be noted that the total channel thickness was kept at 50 nm [12]. A thin front channel layer should be able to provide large amount of carriers as driving current pumps while a thick back channel layer should be able to serve as the carrier transport path. Previously, Kim et al. reported the fabrication of ZGO/IGZO bilayer channel [13]. After the deposition of the bilayer channel, they annealed their samples at 450°C for 2 hours and found no interdiffusion. Thus, we believe no interdiffusion has occurred in our devices. As shown in Fig. 1(a), the channel length and width of the fabricated TFTs were 100 and 200 μm, respectively. We also co-sputtered four samples each with one single IGO layer. For these samples, we kept the sputtering powers for Ga2O3/In2O3 targets at \n\nDevice Letters\n\n## > Replace This Line With Your Paper Identification Number (Double-Click Here To Edit) < 2\n\n100W/40W (i.e., sample A), 100W/50W (i.e., sample B), \n\n![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)\n\n100W/60W (i.e., sample C), and 90W/60W (i.e., sample D), respectively. In other words, the conditions used for the first three samples were identical to those used for the back channel while the conditions used for the fourth sample were identical to those used for the front channel. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were then used to characterize these samples.\n\n## Iii. Results And Discussion\n\nFig. 1(b) shows XRD spectra measured from the four samples with single IGO layer. It can be seen that no clear peak was found which suggests the IGO layers prepared in this study were all amorphous. Fig. 2(a), 2(b) and 2(c) show dark IDS-VDS\ncharacteristics measured from devices A, B, and C, respectively. It can be seen that these TFTs exhibit excellent saturation and pinch-off characteristics, indicating that the entire channel region can be depleted completely. Fig. 3(a) plots dark ID-VG\ntransfer characteristics measured from the as fabricated TFTs with VDS = 4 V. It can be seen that gate leakage currents of these devices were all extremely small (i.e., < 10-7 A). This indicates that no leaky gate induced overestimation of mobility occurred. Fig. 3(b) plots ID\n1/2–VG characteristics measured from the as fabricated TFTs. From these curves, we can determine both μFE and the threshold voltage, VTH [14]. Table I \nsummarized the extracted electrical parameters. As listed in Table I, it can be seen that VTH were 0.5, 0.5, and 0 V for devices A, B, and C, respectively. To ensure these values were reproducible, we prepared 12 samples using the same conductions for devices A, B, and C (i.e., 36 samples totally). \n\nWe found that the deviations of VTH were within 0.1 V for all these three types of TFTs. This suggests that the rf power of In2O3 used during the back channel deposition only results in slight change in the interfacial property between the SiO2 gate dielectric and the IGO channel. \n\nFurthermore, it was found that μFE were 32.5, 34.4, and 53.2 cm2/Vs while the sub-threshold swings, SS, were 0.26, 0.20, and 0.19 V/decade, for devices A, B, and C, respectively. In other words, we can achieve larger μFE and smaller SS, as we increased the indium content in the back channel. Since the large 100 µm channel length was used, we should be able to neglect the effect of contact resistance when extracting the carrier mobility. It should be noted that the large µFE and small SS are important for achieving large driving current and high switching speed for practical TFT applications. It should also be noted that μFE and SS observed from the three fabricated TFTs were all better than those observed from the previously reported TFTs with single a-IGO channel [11]. The ~107 Ion/Ioff ratios observed from these TFTs were two orders of magnitude larger than those observed from the TFTs with single a-IGO \nchannel [11]. As shown the fig 3(c), we also measured output characteristics of the fresh TFTs with VDS = 0.1 V while the Ion/Ioff ratios were 7.4×104, 8.4×104, and 7.3×104 for devices A, \nB, and C, respectively. In this work, the mobility was determined in the saturation region. In the saturation region, drain current can be represented by the following equation\n[15] : \n\n## = Μ 2 ( − )2 … (1)\n\nwhere Ci is the capacitance per unit area of the gate insulator, W \nis the channel width, L is the channel length, VTH is the threshold voltage. ID is the drain-to-source current, VGS is the gate voltage, and μFE is the field-effect mobility. Fig 2(d) shows µFE measured with different VGS. It can be seen clearly that the µFE measured from device C was always larger than those measured from devices A and B.\n\n![1_image_1.png](1_image_1.png)\n\n![1_image_2.png](1_image_2.png)\n\n## Device Letters > Replace This Line With Your Paper Identification Number (Double-Click Here To Edit) < 3\n\nshows the re-measured ID–VG characteristics while Table II \nsummarized the extracted electrical parameters. As listed in Table II, it can be seen that VTH and µFE changed only slightly while Ion/Ioff ratios decreased by about one order of magnitude for all these devices. It should be noted that the > 106 Ion/Ioff ratios measured from these TFTs after 3 months were still reasonably large. On the other hand, it was found that SS and was degraded significantly. Fig. 4(a) and (b) shows hysteresis measured from the fresh TFTs and the 3-month-old TFTs, respectively. Here, we define the VTH shift in the hysteresis loop as ΔVH. For the fresh TFTs, it can be seen that ΔVH were 3.9, 3.5, and 2.9 V for devices A, B, and C, respectively. The large ΔVH observed from the fresh TFTs should be attributed to the large amount of trapped charges at the semiconductor/dielectric interface [16-20]. After 3 months, ΔVH became 12, 10.5, and 9.8 V for devices A, B, and C, respectively. The larger ΔVH should be attributed to the fact that these devices were not passivated and stored under high moisture surroundings [21-22]. One possible method to minimize ΔVH and to minimize the degradations of SS is to properly package these TFTs. \n\nFrom the XPS qualitative analysis data (not shown here), it was found that the indium contents were 15.4 %, 17.3 %, 18.3 \n%, and 20.8% for samples A, B, C, and D, respectively. In other words, the In:Ga atomic ratios for the back channel of devices A, B, and C were around 15:46, 17:51, 18:52, respectively, while the In:Ga atomic ratio for the front channel was around 21:45. It should be noted that the In:Ga atomic ratio for the back channel of device C was smaller than that of the front channel. This indicates that we should still have a reasonable bilayer channel for device C. The absorption coefficient spectra of these four a-IGO films are shown in Fig. 5(a). From these spectra, it can be seen that the optical bandgap of samples A, B, \nC, and D were 4.5, 4.2, 4.0, and 3.5 eV, respectively. Using XPS analysis, we could determine the valence band spectra using the linear extrapolation method, as shown in Fig. 5(b) [23]. In can be seen that the relative energy differences between Fermi level and the valence band maximum (ΔEV) were 2.6, 2.6, 2.5, and 2.5 eV for samples A, B, C, and D, respectively. Thus, the relative energy differences between Fermi level and the conduction band minimum (ΔEC) of samples A, B, C, and D \nwere 1.9, 1.6, 1.5, and 1 eV, respectively, as shown in Fig. 5(c). \n\nAlthough ΔEC of these a-IGO films seemed to be rather high\n(i.e., ΔEC ≥ 1 eV), lager ΔEC could lead to lower leakage current for the fabricated TFTs [24]. \n\n![2_image_2.png](2_image_2.png)\n\nFig. 6 shows energy band diagrams for the fabricated TFTs operated with positive gate bias (i.e., VGS > 0 V) and negative gate bias (i.e., VGS < 0 V), respectively. With VGS > 0, the barrier height between front channel and back channel should be reduced by the applied electrical field. Hence, we achieved larger on-current and higher carrier mobility. With VGS < 0 V, \ncarriers collected by the source and drain will be obstructed by the back channel. Thus, we achieved smaller off-current from the fabricated TFTs, as compared to the TFTs with single a-IGO channel. It should be noted that the front channel and the back channel play different roles. Front channel provides large amount of carriers. This results in large charge accumulation and thus large driving current. On the other hand, back channel dominates carrier transport path under both on-state and off-state.\n\nTABLE I Electrical parameters of the as fabricated fresh TFTs at a constant VDS of 4V\nDevice μFE\n(cm2/Vs)\nVTH(V) Ion/Ioff SS\n\n| VDS of 4V   |      |        |          |      |\n|-------------|------|--------|----------|------|\n| Device      | μFE  | VTH(V) | Ion/Ioff | SS   |\n| (cm2 /Vs)   |      |        |          |      |\n| A           | 32.5 | 0.5    | 2.1×107  | 0.26 |\n| B           | 34.4 | 0.5    | 4.1×107  | 0.2  |\n| C           | 53.2 | 0      | 3.2×107  | 0.19 |\n\nTABLE II Electrical parameters of the fabricated TFTs measured after 3 \n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)\n\n![2_image_1.png](2_image_1.png)\n\nIV.

Finally, 31inch OLED TV employing GOA circuit applied by this optimized backplane was successfully demonstrated.\n\nAuthor Keywords I-V crossover, top gate a-IGZO TFT, high reliability, GOA WOLED \n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nIn recent years, more and more displays have desired larger screen and higher resolution which normal a-Si backplane technology is not satisfied for these growing requiments. Amorphous oxide semiconductor TFTs, such as a-IGZO TFTs, are considered as next-generation backplane technology for large-sized OLED and flexible displays due to high electron mobility greater than 10 cm2/Vs, low process temperature under 300 ℃ , and large-area uniformity [1-2]. Generally, large parasitic capacitance between gate and source/drain electrodes in conventional staggered bottom-gate structure enhances the signal RC delay and decreases the operating speed of driving circuits [3-4]. The parasitic capacitance of a-IGZO TFT can significantly be reduced by applying top-gate self-aligned structure which has almost no metal overlap between gate and source/drain electrodes. Therefore, the application of top-gate self-aligned IGZO TFTs is advantageous for large size and high resolution AMOLED display. However, the instability of top-gate self-aligned a-IGZO TFTs caused by the charge trapping, the adsorption of hydrogen/oxygen molecules, the thermal effect, and the illumination, which is very susceptible to the fabrication process, would obstructe their industrial applications [5-6]. So it is still a challenge to fabricate good uniformity and long-term reliability top-gate self-aligned a-IGZO TFTs. In this paper, the positive bias temperature stress (PBTS) reliability of top-gate a-IGZO TFTs, which related to the I-V crossover, was improved by GI layer deposition parameters optimization and hydrogen plasma treatment. Moreover, the topgate a-IGZO TFT with long-term high reliability and excellent VTH uniformity on the Gen 4.5 glass have been demonstrated. Finally, a 31-inch OLED TV employing the internal gate driver on array (GOA circuit) TV applied by this optimized backplane was successfully demonstrated based above investigation. \n\n## 2. Experiment\n\nTop-gate self-aligned a-IGZO TFTs were fabricated on Gen 4.5 glass. Firstly, a light-shielding metal was deposited and patterned on substrate. Secondly, a SiOx buffer layer was deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). Then a-IGZO was deposited by sputtering, and defined through photolithography and wet etching. SiOx layer was deposited by PECVD as the gate insulator (GI). Mo/Al/Mo metal layers were deposited using DC sputtering as the gate layer. Gate and GI layer were continuously patterned to form top-gate self-aligned structure. Plasma treatment was applied for creating n+ IGZO S/D ohmic contact. After inter-layer dielectrics deposition (ILD), Mo/Al/Mo metal layers were deposited and patterned as the source (S) and drain (D). Devices fabrication were finished by passivation (PV) layer deposition. An Keithley 4200-SCS semiconductor parameter analyzer was used to measure device electrical properties in the dark under ambient condition. The dimension of TFTs studied in this work are all the same size of W/L=10μm/8μm.\n\n## 3. Results And Discussion\n\nBased on device measurement, the I-V crossover phenomenon (positive Vth shift of 2nd ID-VG curve compared with the Vth of 1st ID-VG curve) was observed from the transfer characteristics of a-IGZO TFTs, shown in figure 1. \n\n![0_image_0.png](0_image_0.png)\n\nIt's well known that some defects exist in the gate insulator (GI) and IGZO/GI interface. The electrons were trapped in these traps during the first forward sweep ID-VGS measurement (VD=0.1V). These electrons remained in the GI layer or interface will lead to positive Vth shift during the second forward sweep ID-VGS measurement (VD=10V). The illustration diagram of electron trapping is shown in Figure 2. \n\n![1_image_1.png](1_image_1.png)\n\nOur further study showed that the PBTS reliability was correlated to I-V crossover behavior of TFT transfer characteristics. The crossover value is defined as Vth(VD=10V)- Vth (VD=0.1V). Figure 3 shows the PBTS reliability (VG=+30 V stress 3600s at 60℃) of three a-IGZO TFTs with various I-V \ncrossover value. We can see that the Vth shift is only 2.6 V when the crossover value is 0.2 V, increasing to 6.9 V when the crossover value is 1.8V. The less I-V crossover of a-IGZO device shows the better PBTS reliability. This is because the I-V crossover value and the Vth shift of PBTS reliability are all influenced by the amount of electron traps. The detail relationship between I-V crossover and PBTS are shown in Table 1.\n\n![1_image_4.png](1_image_4.png)\n\n| Point   | Crossover (V)   | PBTS (V)   |     |\n|---------|-----------------|------------|-----|\n|         | Point 1         | 0.2        | 2.6 |\n| Point 2 | 1.0             | 4.8        |     |\n| Point 3 | 1.8             | 6.9        |     |\n\nIn order to eliminate the I-V crossover behavior of TFT transfer curves, GI deposition process was optimized. We designed three kinds of devices with different GI layer (device A, B and C). The ID-VG uniformity of three devices were monitored at different sites of Gen. 4.5 glass. The PBTS reliability was also measured, shown in figure 4. Device A exhibits serious I-V crossover behavior before optimization. It shows the worst PBTS performance, the Vth shift is 4.8 V after 3600s stress at VG=+30 V and 60℃. Device B and device C show improved results, the Vth shift of are 3.2 V and 0.98 V, respectivily.\n\n![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)\n\n![1_image_2.png](1_image_2.png)\n\n![1_image_3.png](1_image_3.png)\n\nGI layers of device A, B and C were analyzed by SIMS \n\n![1_image_5.png](1_image_5.png) (secodary ion mass spectroscopy) and the results were shown in Figure 5. The hydrogen content of device A GI layer is lowest, while the device C GI layer is the highest. Based on the above results, we suggest that oxygen defects of GI layer could be passivated by these H atoms. The defect density of GI layer could be reduced. The increasment of hydrogen content in GI \nlayer relieves the I-V crossover and improve the PBTS of aIGZO TFTs. ΔVth of device C PBTS reliability is 0.98 V, \nshowing the best result while the I-V crossover value is only 0.11 V. The detail parameters of these devices are shown in Table 2. Figure 6 shows the illustration digram of hydrogen plasma treatment. Before ILD layer deposition, hydrogen plasma treatment was applied to further improve device performance. \n\nFigure 7 shows the transfer characteristics of the top-gate selfaligned a-IGZO TFTs and the PBTS reliability of the treated sample named device D. The ΔVth deviation at different sites of Gen. 4.5 glas is less than 0.4 V, which is benefit for AMOLED display. Finally, the optimized a-IGZO TFTs show the Vth of 0.64 V, mobility of 15.67 cm2/Vs and subthreshold swing of 0.17 V/dec. The detail parameters of device D is shown in Table 2. \n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)\n\n![2_image_4.png](2_image_4.png)\n\n![2_image_2.png](2_image_2.png)\n\n(b) 11-1\n\n![2_image_3.png](2_image_3.png)\n\n| Mobility   |            |           |       |      |\n|------------|------------|-----------|-------|------|\n| Device     | SS         | Crossover | PBTS  |      |\n| (cm2/Vs)   | (V/decade) | (V)       | (V)   |      |\n| Device A   | 14.30      | 0.15      | 1.0   | 4.95 |\n| Decice B   | 13.45      | 0.13      | 0.46  | 3.18 |\n| Device C   | 13.68      | 0.14      | 0.11  | 0.98 |\n| Device D   | 15.67      | 0.17      | -0.02 | 0.29 |\n\nMoreover, we developed gate driver on array (GOA circuit)\napplied in 31-inch OLED TV.  The GOA circuit consists of various TFT channel size, even including the size of W/L=2500/8 um. The output performance of GOA circuit is dominantly degraded by positive AVth of GOA TFTs under PBTS stress. Therefore,  We also checked the  PBTS reliability of GOA TFTs with different channel width. From Figure 8, we can see the PBTS reliability is good even the channel width increases to 600 um and 2500 um.\n\n![2_image_1.png](2_image_1.png)\n\nFinally, we demonstrated the 31-inch OLED TV employing the GOA circuit applied by this optmized backplane.\n\nThe photograph of display image and detail parameters are shown in\n\nFigure 9.\n\n![2_image_5.png](2_image_5.png)\n\n## Conclusion\n\n4.\n\nIn this paper, the PBTS of top-gate self-aligned a-IGZO TFTs was improved by optimizing the GI layer deposition process and hydrogen plasma treatment. Hydrogen plasma treatment before ILD layer deposition and high hydrogen content GI layer can effectively reduce the defects in a-IGZO TFTs. Moreover, through the above process optimization, device with excellent V TH uniformity on a Gen 4.5 glass and high PBTS reliability was sucessfully fabricated. Finally, we demonstrated the 31-inch OLED TV employing the GOA circuit applied by high PBTS\nreliability top-gate self-aligned a-IGZO backplane. \n\n## 5.

        "text": "# Understanding And Controlling Electronic Defects In Amorphous Oxide Semiconductor Keisuke Ide*, Hideo Hosono**, Toshio Kamiya* ,** *Laboratory For Materials And Structures, Tokyo Institute Of Technology, Japan\n\n**Material Research Center for Element Strategy, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan\n\n## Abstract\n\nAmorphous oxide semiconductors (AOSs) have been widely applied for state-of-the-art flat-panel display as a thin-film transistor (TFT) since 2012. Besides, AOSs have been studied not only for TFT but also for other electronic devices such as sensor, diode, transport layer, memory, and so on. To realize those *nextgeneration electronics using AOS material, it is important to* understand the defect state in AOS material. Here we review research about defects in AOS up to now including *O-related,* hydrogen-related, and structure-related defects, which are important to understand the AOS feature. At the conference, we will also mention the exploration of new functional AOS materials *based on defect engineering.*\n\n## Author Keywords\n\nAmorphous oxide semiconductor, thin-film transistor, In-Ga-ZnO, a-IGZO, electronic defects\n\n## 1. Introduction \n\n![0_Image_1.Png](0_Image_1.Png)\n\nAmorphous oxide semiconductor (AOS) is a relatively new material system for large-area semiconductor devices compared with hydrogenated amorphous Si (a-Si:H) or low-temperature polycrystalline Si (LTPS). Among them, amorphous In-Ga-Zn-O (a-IGZO) was reported in 2004 as a channel material of thin-film transistors (TFTs) and attracted much attention because of the high electron mobility > 10 cm2/Vs, good uniformity, and stability. (1,2) Besides a-IGZO TFT was expected to be applied for flexible substrate because of the low processing temperature (<400 °C). However, some stability issues are still important to be solved, especially for low-temperature processed AOS. Since the first report of AOS TFTs, various defects have been clarified and proposed, which include (i) oxygen deficiency, (ii) weakly-bonded/undercoordinated oxygen, (iii) peroxide, (iv) low valence state cations, (v) hydrogen, and (vi) metastability due to the amorphous structure as summarized in Fig. 1. These defects are related closely to TFT characteristics, hysteresis, and instability. Besides, these defects can work as compensation defects, and thus important to explore new functional AOS \nmaterials. In this paper, we will review the present understanding of these defects. (3) At the conference, we will also introduce some new AOS development based on defect understanding.\n\n## 2. Electronic Defects In Aos Material\n\n![0_Image_0.Png](0_Image_0.Png) Excess Oxygen And Oxygen-Deficient Defects: It Is Widely Known That The Conductivity Of Oxide Semiconductors\n\nlike indium tin oxide (ITO) can be tuned by changing the oxygen supply amount during deposition. Similarly, the carrier concentration of a-IGZO is also affected by the oxygen flow ratio \n(RO2) during sputtering deposition. As shown in Fig. 2(a), the aIGZO film deposited at RO2 =1% has a carrier concentration of 1019 cm-3and shows degenerated conduction, while RO2 = 10% \nlargely suppresses the carrier concentration lower than 1011 cm-3. \n\nCorresponding TFT curves were also shown in Fig. 2 (b). To understand the oxygen-related defects, it is worth seeing both extreme cases (e.g. too high and low RO2 condition). (4) Figure 3 shows the absorption coefficient for a-IGZO films deposited at various RO2 from 0 to 10%. Subgap optical absorptions and free-carrier absorption increase with decreasing RO2. Note that a-IGZO films deposited without oxygen supply (RO2 = 0%) show strong absorption at the whole visible region, resulting in the dark color thin film as seen in Fig. 3(b). It is confirmed by hard x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurement that segregated indium metal caused the absorption and serious degradation of transport property (data not shown). (5) On the other hand, oxygen sometimes forms an electron trap, though oxygen is the major component of AOS, e.g. neutral oxygen (O0) can capture electrons to be O2-. The defects behave as a negative-U trap and cause the bistable behavior in TFT operation as seen in Ref. (6). Note that such oxygen is called excess oxygen in terms of the stoichiometry, while it can be regarded as interstitial oxygen from the viewpoint of the AOS framework. This kind of oxygen is expected to have weaker chemical bonds, and actually, such weakly bonded oxygen is experimentally confirmed by TDS chemical analysis.\n\n![1_image_2.png](1_image_2.png)\n\nFig. 4 Transport proerpty (Hall mobility and carrier \n\n![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)\n\n![1_image_1.png](1_image_1.png) concentration) for H-plasma treated a-IGZO films as a function of H-plasma treatment time.\n\n## Hydrogen Related Defects:\n\nThe incorporation of hydrogen into oxide semiconductors serves as electron donors not only in crystalline ZnO but also in AOS materials. Fig. 4 shows Hall mobility and carrier concentration as a function of H-plasma treatment time. H-doped a-IGZO shows very high carrier concentration up to 1019 cm-3and degenerated conduction. Density functional calculation also supports this experimental result, which is hydrogen in a-IGZO forms -OH state and releases a free electron as reported in Ref. (7). It should also be noted that a-IGZO thin films unintentionally include impurity hydrogen higher than 1020 cm-3(please refer to ref. (3)\nfor details about H-related defects)\n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)\n\n## Structural Related Defects:\n\nThe total pressure (PTot) during sputtering deposition has a large impact on the microstructure of the a-IGZO films. X-ray reflectivity measurement revealed that the film density decreased from 6.1 to 5.5 g/cm3 with increasing PTot from 0.55 to 5.0 Pa. \n\nInterestingly the lowest value is almost 10% smaller than that of the optimized a-IGZO films. But it hardly imagines that the usual packing structures of ionic bonds can produce such low-density structures. Then we employed HAADF-STEM observation because high-contrast images according to the atomic numbers of the constituent elements can be obtained (Fig. 5). It is confirmed that low-density a-IGZO film has a very inhomogeneous structure, meaning that the origin of low density, in this case, is vertical sparse regions (open voids in other words).\n\nFig. 6 compare the TFT transfer characteristics for high- and lowdensity a-IGZO films. Low-density TFT deposited at the high PTot led to poor TFT with the extraordinary high threshold voltage larger than 14 V and low on-current. From TDS measurement for this low-density film, it is confirmed that this low-density film contains a lot of weakly-bonded O. These results provide the caution that PTot must be optimized to produce a high-density film, and high PTot conditions should not be employed.\n\n3. **Summary**\nWe briefly reviewed the progress on the AOS study from the viewpoint of electronic defects including excess-O/O-deficiency, H-related defects, and structural defects. Several defects have been clarified in the past decade. However, instability issues are still not satisfactorily solved, especially for the next generation of electronics such as transparent/flexible applications. A deeper investigation of those defects is necessary and it would lead to the development of new functional AOS materials as well.\n\n## 4.

The TFTs with Pr doping exhibited a remarkable suppression of the light-induced instability. A negligible photo-response and remarkable enhancement in negative gate bias stress under illumination (NBIS) were achieved in the PrIZO-TFTs. Meanwhile, the PrIZO-TFTs showed reasonable characteristics with a high-field-effect mobility of 26.3 cm2/V s, SS value of 0.28 V/decade, and Ion/Ioff ratio of 108. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, microwave photoconductivity decay, and photoluminescence spectra were employed to analyze the effects of the Pr concentrations on the performance of PrIZO-TFTs. We disclosed that acceptor-like trap states induced by Pr ions might lead to the suppression of photo-induced carrier in conduction band, which is a new strategy for improving illumination stability of amorphous oxide semiconductors. Finally, a prototype of fully transparent AMOLED display was successfully fabricated to demonstrate the potential of Pr-doping TFTs applied in transparent devices.\n\nKEYWORDS: thin film transistor, negative bias illumination stress, praseodymium doping, metal oxide, photo-response\n- INTRODUCTION\nAmorphous oxide semiconductors (AOSs) thin-film transistors\n(TFTs) have been intensively studied for use in transparent and flexible electronics, such as pixel drivers, electronic paper, skin sensor, and smart identification cards.1−3 These TFTs exhibit sufficiently high mobility, excellently larger area uniformity, and low-temperature capability. Additionally, transparency of the AOSs, because of their large band gap (>3.0 eV), would be an advantage for realizing the fully transparent displays or sensors.4 However, the experimental data suggest that the characteristics of AOSs TFTs are strongly affected by the light irradiation even in the visible spectrum, especially, combining with the negative gate bias stress\n(NBIS).5,6 Indeed, the light-induced instability of AOSs TFTs is a crucial issue that should be resolved before their commercialization into an optoelectronic devices.\n\nTo date, several models have been proposed to reveal the mechanism of light-induced instability in AOSs TFTs. The carrier trapping and ambient interaction models are commonly used to expound this deterioration,7−9 but they can hardly explain the remarkable photo-response of AOSs TFTs under the visible-light irradiation (hν < Eg, band gap of the AOSs),\neven for the TFTs with an optimized passivation. The oxygen vacancies (VO) photo-ionization model is commonly used to explain the degradation, which claimed that holes generated by the light ionized the deep sub-gap state of neutral VO above the valence band maximums (VBMs),10−13 which were trapped at the interface of channel/dielectric or further injected into the bulk of dielectrics, resulting in the degradation of the TFTs performance. Meanwhile, the various oxygen vacancy-related defects in the AOS films, such as meta-stable peroxide defects\n(O2 2−),14 oxygen interstitials (Oi), and hydrogen-related complex were also reported as the origins of this light-induced instability.15−17 On the basis of the above understanding of light-induced degradation, several approaches were proposed to improve the stability of metal oxide TFTs, such as the gate insulator modification, channel layer treatment, and passivation matching.18−22 It is worth to note that various elements were adopted for doping in AOSs to relieve the light-induced instability, such as Hf−In−Zn−O,23 Ta−In−Zn−O,24 Zr− Zn−Sn−O,25 B−In−Zn−O,26 N−In−Zn−O,27 IGZO:N− H,28 SIZO/IZO,29 VZTO/ZTO,30 IGZO:N/IGZO,31 and so forth. The main purpose of dopants is to suppress the creation of oxygen vacancy because of the stronger binding strength of the doping elements. Other methods can be also employed to avoid the light-induced instability, such as light-shielding layers or pixel compensation circuits, however, leading to raising both cost and complexity.

Previous reports have shown that the IZO-TFTs are very sensitive to light irradiation,24,26,27,32 owning to their low formation energies of oxygen vacancy in In2O3 (3.06 eV) and ZnO (3.75 eV). A\npowerful oxide semiconductor channel material with praseodymium (Pr) doping was developed in this work to improve the light-induced instability. The effects of the Pr concentrations on the performance of Pr-doped IZO (PrIZO) TFTs were systematically investigated with conventional co-sputtering system. A distinct mechanism for the enhancement of bias illumination stability in PrIZO-TFTs was proposed with trapassisted recovery model, while examining the photo-response and NBIS instability under the white light-emitting diode (LED) illumination.\n\n- EXPERIMENTAL SECTION\nDevice Fabrication. A bottom-gate staggered structure was employed in this study, as shown in the inset of Figure 1b. A gate Figure 1. (a) Performance of PrIZO-TFTs with variable Pr\n\n![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)\n\nconcentration. (b) μsat and SS extracted from the corresponding TFTs.\n\nmetal (Mo, 200 nm) and stacked gate insulator (SiO2/Si3N4, 50/250 nm) were deposited subsequently by DC sputtering and plasmaenhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). For the channel deposition, the PrIZO (20 nm) thin films with different Pr concentration (0/0.64/1.09/1.42/2.98 at. %) were deposited using the RF magnetron co-sputtering system by changing the plasma power of each target of IZO (In/Zn = 4/1 at. %) and PrIZO (Pr/In/ Zn = 0.2/4/1 at. %). Both the ceramic targets of IZO and PrIZO were sintered with purity of 99.99%. The films were deposited using Ar and O2 mixing gas (Ar/O2 = 9:1) at 5 mTorr and patterned by a wet etching process (see Figure S1). Then, a 300 nm thick SiO2 was grown by PECVD serving as the etch stop layer (ESL) and patterned by dry etching. Mo source (S)/drain (D) electrodes (200 nm thick) were formed by DC sputtering and patterned by wet etching. After that, 200 nm thick SiO2 as passivation was grown by PECVD. Finally, the fabricated TFTs were annealed at 300 °C in air for 30 min.\n\nCharacterization and Measurements. The device characterization was carried out using a probe station and an Agilent B1500A\nsemiconductor parameter analyzer. The length (L) and width (W) of the channel were 10 and 20 μm, respectively. The transfer curves were measured at a drain bias of 9.1 V, and the Von was determined from the VGS at IDS of L/W × 10−9 A. The electrical stress was applied at a VGS of −20 V and a VDS of 0 V with 7200 s. The illumination was applied using a commercialized LED light unit with a brightness of 12 000 cd/m2. All measurements were carried under ambient condition at room temperature. The crystal structures of thin films were investigated by X-ray diffractometer (XRD, X'Pert-PRO, PANalytical, Holland) with a Cu Kα1 radiation. Hall measurements were carried out with MMR's H50 Hall system in a Van der Pauw configuration.\n\nThe transmittances of various PrIZO thin films on quartz substrates were measured by UV−vis spectroscopy (UV-3600, Shimadzu). The chemical compositions were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250i). Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured with Xe lamp excitation (Edinburgh luminescence spectrometer FLS 980) at room temperature. The photoconductivity responses were investigated using a microwave photoconductivity decay (micro-PCD) measurement system (KOBELCO Research Institute, LTA-1620SP).\n\n- RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nThe representative transfer characteristics of PrIZO-TFTs (W/\nL = 20/10 μm) as a function of the Pr ratio ([Pr]/[Pr + In +\nZn]) are shown in Figure 1a. The saturation mobility (μsat) is extracted using saturation-mode gradual channel approximation, and the turn-on voltage (Von) is determined by the gate voltage (VGS), which induces a drain current of L/W × 10 nA\nat a VDS of 9.1 V. The subthreshold swing (SS) is extracted from the liner portion of the plot log IDS versus VGS. The performance parameters of all the devices are summarized in Table 1. The IZO-TFTs exhibited a μsat with 32.5 cm2/V s, a SS with 0.12 V/decade, and Von with −0.4 V. As for the Prdoped TFTs, the Von negative shifted monotonically from −0.4 to −0.9 V (whereas the Pr concentration is 2.98%). The values of μsat and SS corresponding to PrIZO-TFTs with different Pr concentrations are illustrated in Figure 1b. The mobility decreased monotonically from 32.5 to 26.3 cm2/V s with Pr doping at 2.98%, whereas the SS degraded from 0.12 to 0.28 V/decade. In the oxide semiconductors, the carrier transport mechanism can be well understood by percolation conduction model,33 which means that the potential barrier would be filled with the raise of Fermi level. As for the n-type AOSs-TFTs, the electron transport in the sub-threshold region is governed by the localized states close to the conduction band minimum (CBM), which will also degrade the mobility. To clarify the influence of trap states on the electrical performance, the trap density in bulk channel layer (NSS) and at channel/gate insulator interface (Dit) are extracted from SS as follows34\n\n$$\\mathrm{SS}={\\frac{q k_{\\mathrm{{B}}}T(N_{\\mathrm{{SS}}}t_{\\mathrm{{ch}}}+D_{\\mathrm{{it}}})}{C_{\\mathrm{{i}}}\\log(e)}}$$\n(1)\nTable 1.

The maximum trap density of NSS,max (Dit,max) can be calculated by setting the Dit (NSS) as zero, and the values for PrIZO-TFTs with different Pr concentration are summarized in Table 1. The NSS,max and Dit,max for the devices without Pr doping are 1.05 × 1017 cm−3 eV−1 and 2.09 × 1011 cm−2 eV−1. These values are proportionally changed to 2.44 ×\n1017 cm−3 eV−1 and 4.88 × 1011 cm−2 eV−1 (Pr ratio of 2.98%)\nwhile increasing the Pr concentration in the IZO film. Meanwhile, it is worth to note that the effect of Pr doping on device performance is relatively concentrated on subthreshold region, as shown in the inset of Figure 1a. These results suggested that Pr cations tended to induce shallow trap states near the conduction band in the semiconductor channel, although the physical nature is not clear yet.\n\nTo investigate the effect of light illumination on electrical properties of PrIZO-TFTs, the characterization of photoresponse was carried out by a white LED lamp. The spectrum of the LED light source is shown in Figure 2f, and the luminance is fixed at 12 000 cd/m2. As shown in Figure 2a, the performance of the TFT devices without Pr doping degraded significantly under the LED illumination. However, the photoresponse is suppressed significantly with appropriate Pr doping, as can be seen in Figure 2b−e. In order to clarify this rigid shift, the Von shift (ΔVon), variations of the SS (ΔSS) and the Ilight/Idark (the ratio of drain current with/without light illumination at a fixed VGS of −5 V) are illustrated in Figure 2g. It is observed that the TFT devices without Pr doping exhibited an obvious negative shift ΔVon of −7.4 V, serious change in ΔSS ≈ 2 V/decade, and Ilight/Idark more than 106.\n\nImpressively, in the TFT with 2.98% Pr doping, the changes in Von and SS are negligible (ΔVon ≈ 0.1 V, ΔSS ≈ 0.02 V/\ndecade), only with a slight increase in the off-current.\n\nAccording to the previous reports,10−13,35 the VO photoionization model is frequently quoted to explicate the degrade mechanism under light illumination in AOS materials and the high-density fully occupied VO states near the VBM, which is verified by the first-principle study and experimental observation.13,36 Analogously, as for the TFT devices without Pr doping (Figure 2a), the VO are excited by the irradiation phones and then created the VO\n2+ states close to the CBM and donated the delocalized electrons in conduction band, resulting in the larger negative shift in transfer curve and the significant degradation of SS. Fortunately, this inferior phenomenon is greatly alleviated in the TFT once with the Pr doping. Thus, it is reasonable to claim that the Pr cations play a determinant role in this photo-response improvement.\n\nThe photo-response of the PrIZO-TFTs with various monochromatic light illumination was also investigated. During the test, the light with various wavelengths ranging from 360 to 700 nm irradiated onto the TFT back-channel for a period of 2 min, and then transfer curves were recorded. Figure 3a,b show the monochromatic photo-response of the PrIZO-TFTs with 0 and 2.98% Pr ratio, respectively. Meanwhile, the monochromatic photo-response of the PrIZO-TFTs with various Pr ratios was investigated, and the corresponding Von shift (ΔVon) compared to the dark condition as a function of the photon energy is exhibited in Figure 3c. Compared to the original dark condition, large photo current was found in IZO-TFT illuminated by the light with wavelengths shorter than 500 nm, causing serious degradation in the subthreshold regime. As for the PrIZOTFT with 2.98% Pr doping, negligible degradation in the subthreshold regime is found even with the energy of incident light larger than 3.4 eV. As shown in Figure 3c, the ΔVon of the PrIZO-TFTs decrease significantly when increasing the Pr concentration, indicating that the remarkable improvement of light-induced instability was achieved with Pr doping. Notably, the Von of the PrIZO-TFT with 2.98% Pr doping has the same value under the light illuminated in the visible region.\n\nTo verify the remarkable improvement of light-induced instability, the doping effect of Pr (0−2.98%) on the physical properties of PrIZO thin films is systematically investigated. The PrIZO thin films with thickness of 100 nm are prepared on quartz substrate for the characterization, and all the films are annealing at 350 °C in air for 30 min. It has been reported that the gate-field-driven migration of VO\n2+ through the grain boundary defects in a polycrystalline IZO channel region toward the gate insulator/channel layer is considered to further deteriorate the light-induced instability.37 Fortunately, the Xray diffraction (XRD) analysis (Figure 4a) reveals that all the\n\n![3_image_0.png](3_image_0.png)\n\nfilms demonstrated an amorphous-like structure with a hump\n\n![3_image_1.png](3_image_1.png)\n\nin the range of 26°−35°, indicating that such small doping concentration of Pr did not change the phase structure of IZO.38 In addition, as can be seen in Figure 4b, the highresolution cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy\n(TEM) image of GI-SiO2/PrIZO/ESL-SiO2 demonstrate that the interface of gate insulator/channel are clearly distinguishable, and the diffraction pattern of PrIZO film exhibits the typical \"halo rings\" of an amorphous material, which corresponding well with the XRD results.\n\nThe Hall mobility and carrier concentration of the PrIZO\nfilms with various Pr content are shown in Figure 4c. The Hall mobility monotonically decreased from 47.7 to 33.7 cm2/V s as the Pr concentration increased from 0 to 2.98%, while the carrier concentration decreased moderately from 5.2 × 1019 to 2.6 × 1019 cm−3. The variation trend of Hall mobility is well in accordance with that of the carrier concentration. This behavior can be successfully described by the percolation theory; the increment of carrier concentration enhances the field effect mobility in metal oxide semiconductors. Meanwhile, it is well known that the CBM in metal-oxide semiconductors is primarily composed of dispersed vacant s-states with short interaction distances.39,40 Thus, the high Hall mobility can be attributed to a high ratio of In/Zn (In/Zn = 4/1), which ensured the carriers transporting efficiently. It is worth to note that the decrease in the Hall mobility is well corresponding to the variation trend of μsat in PrIZO-TFTs, and the relatively low μsat compared to the Hall mobility may be ascribed to the interfacial scattering effect or contact resistance. In addition, the moderate carrier density decreased in the PrIZO film with Pr doping, indicating the temperate decrease of oxygen vacancy concentration.\n\nThe measurements of optical transmittance are performed with a double beam spectrophotometer under the wavelength from 300 to 800 nm. As shown in the inset of Figure 4d, the maximum transmittance of the films with (2.98%) and without\n(0%) Pr doping is about 97%. The optical band gap (Eg) is estimated by using a standard Tauc plot method and the results are shown in Figure 4d.41 Obviously, the Pr doping at 2.98% did not significantly change the optical band gap (Eg ≈\n3.15 eV), which is very close to that of IZO (Eg ≈ 3.10 eV).\n\nConsidering the results shown in Figure 3c, the PrIZO-TFT with 2.98% Pr doping demonstrated a negligible degradation; even the photon energy is larger than the band gap of the PrIZO channel, indicating that the enhanced light stability is not likely induced by the discrepancy of band gap.\n\nThe XPS was employed to analyze the composition, chemical state, and VBM of the PrIZO thin films to further understand the mechanism of the electrical performance with Pr doping. The results shown in Figure 5a,b reveal that the O\n1s peaks can be fitted by two Gaussian distributions with binding energies at 529.8 and 530.4 eV, which are corresponding to the oxygen in oxide lattices (denoted as O−M−O) and oxygen vacancies (denoted as VO), respectively. The corresponding Pr 3d spectra are shown in Figure S2\n(Supporting Information). The atomic percentages of the VO\nfor the thin films without (0%) and with (2.98%) Pr doping are 45.2 and 35.1% via the semiquantitative analyses of oxygen compositions. This decrease of the VO ratio can be explained by the stronger bonding strength of Pr−O (753 kJ/mol) than that of In−O (360 kJ/mol) and Zn−O (284.1 kJ/mol),42 suppressing the VO formation, which are well corresponding to the results of Hall measurement that carrier concentration gradually decreased with increasing Pr concentration. As well known, the oxygen vacancies play an important role in metaloxide semiconductors. Kamiya et al. has reported a complex behavior for the oxygen vacancy in metal-oxide materials,43 that both the occupied deep trap states (∼2.3 eV below the CBM) and the unoccupied shallow donor states (∼0.15 eV\nbelow the CBM) are simultaneously observed, depending on their local structure. Oxygen deficiencies tend to form deeplevel trap states near the VBM once if a large free space is generated by the defect structure. Otherwise, the shallow level donor states would be obtained that enhances conductivity.\n\nThus, the case of the VO reduction may include both the shallow donor states and the deep trap states. In addition, the valence band spectra in Figure 5c reveal that both films exhibited a similar VBM energy levels of 2.8 eV below the Fermi level (Ef). Meanwhile, considering the results of monochromatic photo-response and the similar optical band gap (∼3.15 eV), it can be speculated that the decrease of VO\ndoes not domain the improvement of light-induced instability because of the invariance of I−V characteristics of PrIZOTFTs under incident light with different wavelengths, even the energy of light larger than 3.4 eV. There may be some other unclear mechanisms for the enhancement with Pr doping.\n\nThe micro-PCD method is a non-destructive, contactless technique that enables characterization of the capture, recombination, and relaxation of photo-generated carriers by observing the temporal response of the microwave reflectivity.44,45 In this system, excess carriers are generated by a laser\n(λ = 349 nm) irradiation to increase the conductivity, resulting in a change of the microwave reflectivity that directly related to the excess carrier density. Figure 6a shows the photoconductivity response of the PrIZO thin films with various Pr concentrations, and the corresponding peak reflectivity signal value and D value are illustrated in Figure 6b. The peak value decreased from 64.4 to 1.8 mV with an increase in Pr doping concentration up to 2.98%, indicating that the lessphoto-induced free carries survived in the Pr-doped films. This phenomenon is well consistent with the photo-response results in Figures 2 and 3, where the degradation is obviously suppressed with the appropriate concentration of Pr doping. The evolution of the D value is inverse to the peak value, implying that more laser-exited carriers are trapped at the localized states below the CBM of PrIZO film.44 According to the results in Figure 1, more degraded SS are exhibited when with more Pr doping. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that the excessive generated trap states (see Table 1) with Pr doping is the main origin of the degradation of the D value. The results of micro-PCD test indicated that the suppression of light-induced current is an intrinsic property of PrIZO film, which don't depend on the transistor device structure or interface state.\n\nIn order to verify the trap states related to the photoresponse, the PL spectra are carried out with an excitation wavelength of 380 nm (3.27 eV, larger than the Eg of PrIZO)\nat room temperature. Figure 6c,d show the deconvoluted PL\nspectra by Gaussian line-shape functions of the thin films without (0%) and with (2.98%) Pr doping. It is found that the radiative recombination processes are remarkably decreased by Pr doping, especially around the emission peak of 2.4 eV. Previous researchers have reported that a broad band in the range of 2.2−2.6 eV can be assigned to the oxygen vacancyrelated emissions.46,47 By considering the slight reduction of the VO with Pr doping, it is reasonable to suggest that the doping may introduce extra non-radiative transitions in the PrIZO thin films.\n\nOn the basis of the above results and analyses, we presented a hypothetic model combined with the previous reports to explain the photo inertness of TFTs characteristics induced by Pr doping. A sub-gap model of PrIZO films as illustrated in Figure 7 is suggested to clarify the mechanism. Normally, as\n\n![4_image_0.png](4_image_0.png)\n\nproposed in oxygen vacancies photo-ionization model,10,12,13\n\n![4_image_1.png](4_image_1.png)\n\nthe neutral VO near VBM would be excited by the irradiation photons (hν > 2.3 eV) and then created the VO\n2+ states situated close to the CBM, donating the delocalized electrons in the conduction band, resulting in a larger negative shift in transfer curve and significant degradation of SS. With the doping of Pr, the lanthanide metal cations would induce a shallow acceptor-like trap states, stretching out the subthreshold drain current and reducing the mobility of PrIZO TFTs, as shown in Figure 1 and Table 1. According to the NSS,max deduced by SS, it is about 1.39 × 1017 cm−3 eV−1 (ΔNSS,max);\nFigure 6. (a) Photoconductivity response of the PrIZO thin films and\n(b) corresponding peak signal and D values. The PL spectra of the PrIZO thin films, (c) 0% Pr and (d) 2.98% Pr.\n\nexcess states density was induced by the Pr doping of 2.98%. Besides, as shown in Figure S3 (Supporting Information), the distribution of the trap density of states (DOSs) was analyzed by the capacitance−voltage (C−V) method.48,49 The results demonstrate that the Pr-induced acceptor-like trap states lies\n∼0.3 eV below the CBM with order of 1017 cm−3 eV−1, which is near the Ef. It is worth to note that the increment of the DOSs induced by Pr doping is well in accordance with the ΔNSS,max deduced by SS. Under light illumination, the photoexcited electrons tend to be trapped by the shallow acceptorlike states, resulting in the drastic suppression of the photocurrent. Meanwhile, according to the reports of the\n\"negative-U\" behavior, announced in the amorphous semiconductor system,50 the shallow acceptor-like states (denote as PrH\n+) charging with the photo-excited electrons would lower the energy of PrH\n+ states (denote as PrL\n+), which is close to the neutral VO states above the VBM and, consequently, triggering the recombination process of VO\n2+ + 2e− → VO; then, the discharged PrL\n+ would recover to the initial PrH\n+ states by relaxation. In other words, the Pr-induced trap state functions as a recombination center of the photo-excited electrons and VO\n2+. This non-radiative transition process in the PrIZO thin films can be verified by the PL characterization. As a result, the photo-response phenomenon of oxide TFTs can be suppressed with the Pr doping. However, it is worth noting that the TFTs characteristics, such as mobility and SS, are slightly deteriorated by the Pr doping, as shown in Table 1. Hence, it is critical that the chemical composition of Pr doping should be fine-tuned to overcome the trade-off between the TFTs' basic performances and light stability.\n\nAs a further certification, the NBIS tests are carried out at VGS = −20 V and VDS = 0 V. A commercialized LED is irradiated on top of the device with the white light through an optical fiber, and the light is not turned off while sampling the transfer characteristic. Figure 8a,b show the time dependence of the transfer curves under an NBIS for the TFTs without (0%) and with (2.98%) Pr doping, respectively. The variations in the Von under the NBIS as a function of the stress time are shown in Figure 8c. It is obvious that the Von shift of −16.5 V\nwith significant degradation of SS could be observed for the device without Pr doping. However, the TFT with Pr (2.98%)\ndoping exhibited a mildly Von shift of −2.0 V. It is worth to note that the NBIS condition is severer than that photoresponse test, because of the continual negative bias stress on gate electrode, which accelerated the photoionized holes to drift to channel/dielectric interface. These results strongly reveal that Pr doping can significantly improve the lightinduced instability. By combining the results shown in Figure 3, the PrIZO-TFTs even did not respond to the photo energy larger than the Eg of PrIZO. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the holes that drift to the channel/dielectric interface would be recombined by the electrons \"carried\" by PrL\n+, resulting in a significantly improved NBIS. On the other hand, the positive gate bias stress (PBS: Vgs = 20 V, Vds = 10 V) and negative gate bias stress (NBS: Vgs = −20 V, Vds = 0 V)\nhave also been tested to investigate the influences of Pr doping on the bias stabilities of TFTs. The corresponding turn-on voltage shifts (ΔVon) are summarized in Figure 8d. It is very clear that PrIZO TFTs show more stable electrical stable electrical properties under bias stress. The improvement can be ascribed to the suppression of oxygen vacancy formation because of the stronger binding strength of Pr−O, which is according to the results of Hall and XPS characterization.\n\nAdditionally, to further confirm the universality of the function of the Pr doping, the commercialized oxide semiconductors (such as IGZO and ITZO) doping with Pr are employed as channel layer to fabricate TFT with the same structure and process as previously stated. The photo-response of the TFTs illustrated in Figure S4 (Supporting Information)\nindicated that the Pr doping could significantly enhanced the light-response stability. These results suggest that the Pr doping has a good commonality to suppress photo-induced current in oxide semiconductor materials.\n\nThe fully transparent TFT back panels for AMOLED display are fabricated by using bottom-gate staggered structure, employing the ITO as gate and S/D electrodes. The channel layer is PrIZO (20 nm, 2.98 at. %), and 2T1C architecture is adopted to drive the TFT panel, as shown in Figure 9a. A\n\n![5_image_0.png](5_image_0.png)\n\nprototype full-color transparent AMOLED display is shown in\n\n![5_image_1.png](5_image_1.png) Figure 9b. The transmittances of the PrIZO-TFTs array panel and the AMOLED display are illustrated in Figure S5 (Supporting Information). It is worth noting that the performance of transparent display shows no degradation under illumination with a white LED lamp, even the luminance up to 100 000 cd/m2 (see Figure S6, Supporting Information),\nindicating that this material has great potentials for applications in transparent AMOLED, transparent microLED displays, or transparent photodetectors.\n\nFigure 8. NBIS test for TFTs (a) without and (b) with Pr doping.\n\nVariations of the Von under the (c) NBIS and (d) PBS & NBS as a function of the stress time.\n\n- CONCLUSIONS\nIn summary, a powerful oxide semiconductor channel material with praseodymium doping is developed. The effects of the Pr concentrations on the PrIZO-TFTs performance are comprehensively investigated. The incorporation of the Pr hardly changes the phase structure of IZO with the concentration below 2.98 at. % and negligibly affects the optical band gap. The photoconductivity response of the PrIZO thin films correspond well to the photo-response in the TFTs. A distinct mechanism is proposed with the trap-assisted non-irradiation recovery model. Finally, the common adaptability in oxide semiconductor materials is confirmed, and a prototype transparent AMOLED display is demonstrated with high resistivity to the visible light.\n\n- ASSOCIATED CONTENT\n\n## *S Supporting Information\n\nThe Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acsami.8b18329.\n\nThe supplementary text of the experiment details.

Among several AOSs, amorphous indium–gallium–zinc oxide (a-IGZO)\nis known to be a promising material for the fabrication of AOS-TFTs because of its excellent properties, including high mobility, high transmittance, low-off current, and low processing temperature [3]–[5]. The a-IGZO that is readily deposited on flexible substrates can be favorably applied to wearable electronics or thin-film circuits [5]. Currently, one of the main challenges for battery-powered portable devices is to reduce operating voltage and power consumption [7].\n\nHowever, achieving high μFE and high ION/OFF at low operating voltage is still challenging for a-IGZO TFTs. Thus, a variety of high-k oxide materials, such as HfLaO [8], Al2O3 [9],\nTa2O3 [10], HoTiO3 [11], and HfO2 [12], have been adopted as the gate insulator (GI) in order to lower the operating voltage of a-IGZO-based TFTs. Another way of lowering the operating voltage is to reduce the thickness of high-k dielectric materials [13]–[18]. For example, it was shown that a-IGZO TFTs with an ALD-grown ultrathin 5 nm HfO2 layer as the GI exhibited good performance such as a small SS\nof 75 mV/decade, a low threshold voltage (Vth) of 0.3 V,\nand a high ION/OFF of 8 × 106 [17]. It was also found that a-IGZO TFTs with solution-processed ultrathin ∼3 nm AlxOy GI gave a current ON/OFF current ratio >105 and a SS\nof 68 mV/decade at 1 V [18]. Although the use of thin high-k dielectric layer resulted in good electrical characteristics, the mobility and/or ION/OFF at low-voltage operation are not sufficiently high enough when compared to those at high voltages. Thus, in this study, to achieve high mobility and ION/OFF at low voltage (<2 V) for use in wearable and portable devices, we proposed TC TFT structures consisting of aIGZO and ALD-Al2O3. The TC TFTs were fabricated by additionally depositing GIs, channel, and source–drain on the top of a top gate (TG) TFT, as shown in Fig. 1. The electrical characteristics of TC TFTs are compared with those of conventional TG, bottom gate (BG), and tandem TFTs.\n\n## Ii. Experimental Procedure\n\nThe glass substrate was chemically cleaned to remove contamination. A 25-nm IGZO film as the lower channel layer was deposited by RF magnetron sputtering using a polycrystalline a-IGZO target (In2O3: Ga2O3: ZnO = 1:1:1 mol.%)\n(99.99% purity). The a-IGZO thin films were deposited at room temperature under RF sputtering power of 60 W, working\n\n![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)\n\npressure of 0.67 Pa, and O 2 /Ar ratio of 0.05. Then 20-nm Ti thin films as the lower source and drain electrodes were deposited by an electron beam (e-beam) evaporator, followed by the deposition of a 40-nm Au capping layer. A 50-nm Al 2 O 3 as the lower GI was deposited at 150 °C with ALD,\nwhere trimethylaluminum and O 2 plasma were used as precursors and oxidants, respectively. After forming the GI,\na 100-nm Ti gate electrode was deposited by e-beam evaporation. A 50-nm Al 2 O 3 as the upper GI was also deposited using the same method as that for the lower GI. To connect the lower and upper electrodes, the Al 2 O 3 layers were patterned by photolithography and etched using ceramic etchant A (Sigma-\nAldrich) and 100-nm Ti window layers were deposited by e-beam. A 25-nm IGZO as the upper channel layer was deposited by RF magnetron sputtering. Note that unlike the lower IGZO film, only Ar gas was used for the deposition of the upper IGZO film. An IGZO/ZnON/IGZO (10/5/10 nm)\ntandem structure was deposited to fabricate tandem TFTs. The ZnON was deposited at room temperature with the following conditions, namely, RF sputtering power of 100 W, working pressure of 0.67 Pa, and Ar/O 2 /N 2 ratio of 5:1:30. Finally, Ti/Al (3/200 nm) upper electrodes were deposited by e-beam evaporation, followed by annealing at 400 °C for 1 h in air.\n\nAll TFTs have a channel width (W) of 20 µ m and channel length ( L ) of 10 µ m. Electrical properties were characterized using a Keithley 4200. The capacitance density of the 50-nm Al 2 O 3 was measured to be 161 nF/cm 2 .\n\nwhere Cox is the capacitance density of GI, W and L are channel width and length, respectively. I D is drain current, II. R ESULT AND D ISCUSSIONS\nV DS is the drain voltage, and V GS is the gate voltage.\n\nFig. 1 exhibits the schematic of five different types of TFTs, The S-TC TFTs show excellent electrical performance, e.g., TG, BG, tandem, and TC TFTs. For TC TFTs, two kinds namely, a large µ FE of 19.68 cm 2 /Vs, a low SS\nof TFTs, namely, symmetric-TC (S-TC) and asymmetricof 72 mV/decade, a small V th of 0.4 V, and a large I ON /I OFF\nTC (A-TC) TFTs were manufactured. For the S-TC TFTs, of 5.48 × 10 8 . Measurements show that the TG and BG TFTs the upper and lower channels are IGZO layers, whereas for give µ FE of 5.23 and 9.82 cm 2 /Vs, V th of 1.4 and 0.45 V,\nthe A-TC TFTs, they are IGZO and I/Z/I layers, respectively.\n\nS SS of 87 and 72 mV/decade, and I ON /I OFF of 5.93 × 10 7 and Furthermore, tandem IGZO/ZnON/IGZO TFTs were found to 4.12 × 10 8 , respectively. The a-IGZO channel of the TG TFTs produce higher mobility and better hysteresis properties than showed low conductivity because the IGZO was deposited those of single a-IGZO TFTs [17]. Thus, tandem IGZO/ZnON\nunder higher oxygen partial pressure than the BG TFTs. The structure was also adopted as the upper channel of A-TC TFTs.\n\nlow mobility and high V th of the TG TFTs are ascribed to To evaluate the performance of the upper and lower channels the low conductivity of the a-IGZO channel. It is noted that of S-TC TFTs and their possible interference, conventional the µ FE and I ON/OFF of the S-TC TFTs are larger than the sum Authorized licensed use limited to: Peking University.

Fig. 2 reveals the transfer characteristics, µ FE and output characteristics of TG, BG, and TC TFTs. The electrical characteristics of TG, BG, and TC\nTFTs are listed in Table I . The V th was taken as a gate voltage\n( V G ), where I D has 1 nA × W/L. The µ FE and SS were derived from the following:\n\n$$\\mu_{\\rm FE}=\\frac{L}{W\\cdot C_{\\rm ox}\\cdot V_{\\rm DS}}\\cdot\\frac{dI_{D}}{dV_{\\rm GS}}\\tag{1}$$ $$\\rm SS=\\left(\\frac{d\\log(I_{D})}{dV_{\\rm GS}}\\right)^{-1}\\tag{2}$$  the coexistence density of $\\rm GL$, $W$ and $I$ are \nof those of the TG TFTs and BG TFTs. Interestingly, the Vth\n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)\n\nand SS of S-TC TFTs are similar to those of BG TFTs. This indicates that the Vth and SS of the S-TC TFTs are determined by single-channel TFTs having lower Vth. Meanwhile, it is observed that the S-TC TFTs show mobility characteristics similar to the sum of TG and BG TFTs, although the former gives somewhat higher μFE. This implies that the TCs of the S-TC TFTs do not operate independently but interfere each other.\n\nFig. 2 shows the excellent performance of the A-TC TFTs with the tandem structure, e.g., high μFE of 30.15 cm2/Vs, a SS of 89 mV/decade, a Vth of −1.25 V, and an ION/OFF of 1.70 × 109. It is noted that like the S-TC TFTs, the A-TC TFTs also display the Vth and SS characteristics similar to those of tandem TFTs having lower Vth. The A-TC TFTs have similar mobility behavior to that of the sum of TG and tandem TFTs, even though the former gives a high value. The tandem TFTs exhibit higher mobility than BG TFTs, because the inserted ZnON layer has higher intrinsic mobility than IGZO [19]. Thus, the tandem channel layer has higher conductivity than the IGZO layer, causing tandem TFTs and A-TC TFTs to produce negative threshold voltages. Since an increase in the channel conductivity causes a negative shift of Vth, oxygen partial pressure during a-IGZO deposition can be optimized to minimize the negative shift of Vth. Due to the superior electrical properties of the tandem channels, the A-TC TFTs display the highest mobility and ION/OFF among the five TFTs.\n\nAll of the TFTs have superior hysteresis characteristics such as 0.02–0.05 V (Table I). The occurrence of such negligible hysteresis can be attributed to the very low interface trap density (Dit) at the GI/semiconductor interface [4]. The Dit can be obtained by\n\n$$D_{\\mathrm{it}}=\\left({\\frac{\\mathrm{SS}\\log(e)}{k T/q}}-1\\right){\\frac{C_{\\mathrm{ox}}}{q^{2}}}$$\n\nwhere e is the base of natural logarithm, k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and q is the electron charge. The Dit is found to be 4.82 × 1011, 2.19 × 1011, 3.77 × 1011, 2.19 × 1011, 5.17 × 1011 cm−2 eV−1 for TG TFTs, BG TFTs, tandem TFTs, S-TC TFTs, and A-TC\nTFTs, respectively. These are the lowest values among those of Al2O3 TFTs [4]. The high Dit of the TG TFTs is caused by plasma-induced damage to the GI/channel interface during Al2O3 deposition [18].\n\nFig. 3 reveals transfer curves before and after the positive bias stress (PBS) and negative bias stress (NBS).\n\nBias stress tests were conducted at room temperature for 10 000 s with a gate bias (VG) of 2 V for PBS and −2 V\nfor NBS. All of the TFTs showed excellent stability, e.g.,\nTG TFTs (+0.26 V under PBS and −0.01 V under NBS), BG TFTs (+0.79 V under PBS and −0.07 V under NBS),\ntandem TFTs (+0.44 V under PBS and −0.09 V under NBS), S-TC TFTs (+0.44 V under PBS and −0.04 V under NBS), and A-TC TFTs (+0.17 V under PBS and −0.06 V\nunder NBS). Such a shift is known to be related to trapped charges and/or defect generation. It is noted that during the bias stress test, the μFE and SS of the TFTs are not significantly degraded. This indicates that a main cause of\n\n$$({\\mathfrak{I}})$$\n\n-Vth could be ascribed to the fact that carriers are trapped near the GI/semiconductor interface and no additional defect states are generated at the channel/dielectric interface after stressing [21]. On the other hand, all of the samples show poorer stability at PBS than NBS. This could be ascribed to the fact that when a negative VG is applied, electrons at the channel/GI interface are depleted, so resulting in no mobile charges to be trapped [22]. Furthermore, the BG TFTs produced poorer stability than the TG TFTs. This can be explained as follows. Oxygen and water molecules are possible causes for the performance degradation of TFTs under bias stress tests [23]. For the BG TFTs, the back channel is exposed to an ambient atmosphere. Hence, as shown in Fig. 4(a), the gate bias-induced vertical electric field could cause the adsorption and/or desorption of gas molecules such as oxygen and water in atmosphere [23]. The conduction band offset between the IGZO and the ZnON in the tandem TFTs could reduce the electron trapping phenomena by hindering electrons from moving to the interface, as shown in Fig. 4(b) [19]. So, the tandem TFTs exhibit more stable characteristics than the BG TFTs. The S-TC TFTs exhibited smaller -Vth\n(0.2 V under PBS) than the BG TFTs (0.25 V under PBS). Furthermore, the A-TC TFTs (0.09 V under PBS) show better stability than the tandem TFTs (0.19 V under PBS). That denotes that charge trapping phenomena in the upper and lower channels in the TC TFTs affect each other. This behavior may be explained as follows. When a positive bias is applied to the gate, electrons are accumulated in the upper and lower channel layers [24]. These electrons can build surface potentials in the upper and lower active regions. The two surface potentials then interfere each other, which may cause lowering of an Authorized licensed use limited to: Peking University.

As presented in Fig. 4(c) , the reduced vertical electric field mitigates the electron trapping phenomenon, allowing TC TFTs to exhibit higher stability. Furthermore ( Table I ), a large increase in the µ FE of the TC TFTs is believed to result from lower average vertical electric field in the TC TFTs, reducing the interface roughness scattering [25].\n\nFig. 4 shows the capacitance–voltage ( C–V ) characteristics at 5 kHz for all TFTs. The minimum capacitance ( Cmin )\nat negative gate voltages is the sum of the capacitance of the depleted channel and the parasitic capacitance caused by the overlap of the gate and source–drain electrodes [26].\n\n| Gate       | L FE      | SS          | I can     |             |      |\n|------------|-----------|-------------|-----------|-------------|------|\n| insulator  | (V)       | (mV/decade) | voltage   |             |      |\n| cm /Vs)    |           |             |           |             |      |\n| A1 , O , ' | 6.3       | 0.3         | 100       | 1.20 × 10 7 | < 2V |\n| LaAlO 4    | 5.4       | 0.29        | 198       | 1.10 × 10 7 | < 2V |\n| SiO,       |           |             |           |             |      |\n| AI,O, 8    | 5.15.15.1 | 0.43        | 100, 1168 | 8.10 × 10 5 | < IV |\n| AI,O,\"     | 9         | 0.44        | 188       | 1.00 × 10 5 | < 1V |\n| Sr-Al,O,\"  | 5.4       | 0.29        | 19999     | 1.10 × 10 5 | < IV |\n| HO,\"       | 5.9       | 0.2         | 190       | 2.40 × 10 7 | < 2V |\n| HfLaO'     | 2.1       | 0.1         | 180       | 200 × 10 5  | < 2V |\n| HO,\"       | 8.1       | 0.15        | 109       | 1.00 × 10 7 | < IV |\n| HO,\"       | 4.6       | 0.3         | 11, 1175  | 800         | < IV |\n| SiO,\"      | 10.13     | 0.52        | 124       | 1.00 × 10 8 | < 2V |\n| Ta,O,/     | 2.3       | 0.4         | 190       | 1.00 × 10 5 | < IV |\n| OTS\"       |           |             |           |             |      |\n| PSSNa\"     | 1.14      | 0.51        | 11, 1176  | 1.40 × 10 7 | < IV |\n| Al,O, 810  | 19.68     | 0.42        | 175       | 5.48 × 10 8 | < 2V |\n| AI,O, A 79 | 30.15     | -1.26       | 10, 179   | 1.70 × 10 8 | < 2V |\n\nFor the TC TFTs, the gate is overlapped with both the lower and upper source–drain electrodes, resulting in a wider overlap area than single-channel TFTs. Thus, the TC TFTs with a larger overlap area exhibit higher C min than singlechannel TFTs. Under strong accumulation state at the gate voltage much larger than the threshold voltage, the maximum capacitance ( C max ) is described by the sum of the parasitic capacitance and intrinsic capacitance of the active layer [27].\n\nAll of the single-channel TFTs give comparable C max . Since the TC TFTs have TCs with different threshold voltages, accumulation occurs through two steps, that is similar to the mobility characteristics. Furthermore, the upper and lower Al 2 O 3 of the TC TFTs are connected in parallel, resulting in a higher C max than single-channel TFTs.\n\nAs summarized in Table II [28]–[33], the effects of highk dielectric materials and thin GIs on the TFT performance have been widely investigated to realize low-voltage operation. Comparison of the a-IGZO TFTs with different dielectrics\n(whose operation voltages were below 2 V) shows that our TC TFTs produce higher mobility (19.69–30.15) and I ON / OFF\n(5.48 × 10 8 –1.70 × 10 9 ) than those reported by other groups.\n\n## Iv. C Onclusion\n\nWe proposed TC TFTs for low-operation applications, which were fabricated with ALD-Al 2 O 3 GI and a-IGZO channel layers. The TC TFTs gave higher µ FE and I ON / OFF than the TG and BG TFTs. Furthermore, the TC TFTs revealed better output performance than the sum of the TG and BG TFTs.\n\nThe A-TC TFTs with tandem structure exhibited a high µ FE of over 30 cm 2 /Vs and I ON /OFF of over 1.0 × 10 9 under operation voltage <2 V. Under positive and negative bias tests, the TC\nTFTs exhibited better stability than the TG and BG TFTs. These results imply that our TC TFTs can be a promising candidate for low-power consumption electronics applications such as wearable and portable devices.\n\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Peking University.

an electric field. Amorphous materials have distinct advantages over their crystalline counterparts in terms of processability and homogeneity (i.e., ease of fabrication of large-sized homogeneous thin films at low temperatures). Amorphous materials with good controllability of their Fermi level would be highly beneficial for large-area electronics, optoelectronics, and flexible applications. These advantages are the major driving force for researching amorphous semiconductors. However, controlling the Fermi level in amorphous semiconductors is impossible because of high-density carrier traps arising from structural randomness. An exception is hydrogenated amorphous silicon\n(a-Si:H), which is widely used in solar cells and thin-film transistors (TFTs) for liquid crystal displays (LCDs).\n\nHowever, band conduction has not been attained in a-Si:H. Thus, the mobility of a-Si:H remains at ∼1 cm2/Vs, which is less than that of polycrystalline Si by two orders of magnitude.\n\nTransparent amorphous oxide semiconductors (TAOSs) are a novel class of amorphous semiconductors characterized by their ionic bonding nature. In addition to high optical transparency to visible light, their mobility is greater than that of a-Si:H by one order of magnitude and can be fabricated using conventional direct current (DC) sputtering at low temperatures. Presently, TFTs with a channel layer of In-Ga-Zn-O (IGZO) are used to drive pixels of high-definition and energy-saving LCDs in smartphones, tablets, PC monitors, and large-sized organic light-emitting diode (OLED) TVs, and they are being studied for several more applications in X-ray imagers and memory devices.\n\nAlthough materials science and device physics of TAOS have rapidly advanced in the last decade, the understanding of science and technology is incomplete due to the short research history and the difference in chemical bonding between oxides and covalent-type semiconductors. Consequently, conventional processing used for a-Si:H has caused serious degradation of the resulting devices, such as plasma treatment involving hydrogen. TAOS is the only semiconducting material that can be fabricated by heating the precursor in the ambient atmosphere.\n\nSolution-derived processing has been extensively studied for using this unique feature for flexible electronics.\n\nThis monograph provides a current understanding of amorphous oxide semiconductors with high mobility and their application to electronics, especially TFTs for displays. The book presents introductory fundamentals and discussions on TFTs and processing, circuits and device simulations, applications to displays and memory devices, and new materials. The authors of each chapter are experts with distinct research achievements in their subject area, and they describe state-of-the-art information along with some fundamental prerequisites for understanding.\n\nFor further study, some review articles and books are listed in the references.\n\nNotwithstanding that the research history of TAOS and their TFT applications is rather short, they now lead the backplane of advanced displays, with applications to memory devices and imagers soon to begin. Furthermore, application to flexible electronics is expected to employ low-temperature processability. Unfortunately, no monograph on TAOSs and TAOS-TFTs has been published to date. I intend to fill the gap between rapid research progress in this field and the demand for relevant semiconductors and devices by researchers, engineers, and students. The background of this book was the 77th Fujihara Seminar held in Hakone, Japan, in October 2019. We appreciate\n❦ ❦\n\n## ❦ Xvi Preface ❦ ❦ ❦\n\nthe financial support from the Fujihara Foundation of Science and the contributors for presenting wonderful talks and active discussions.\n\nThe planning of this book was first solicited by Dr. Ian Underwood, the publication committee chair of the Society for Information Display (SID). I appreciate his guidance and patience. I acknowledge my colleagues at Tokyo Tech for organizing the seminar and editing this book. Special thanks to Professors Hideya Kumomi, Junghwan Kim, and Keisuke Ide. Finally, I dedicate this monograph to Dr. Kazunobu Tanaka, a pioneer in amorphous semiconductors. When I was a PhD candidate, I was impressed by his enthusiastic talk on photostructural change in amorphous chalcogenide. I am happy to be presented with the opportunity to publish this book on a novel class of amorphous semiconductors with excellent colleagues.\n\nJune 2021 *Hideo Hosono* Tokyo Institute of Technology\n\n## Series Editor'S Foreword\n\nWithin the flat-panel display industry, most technological change has occurred in an incremental and evolutionary manner, where developments in materials, processes, and precision have gradually improved products to provide the outstanding performance and capability we see today. Against this background, there have been a small number of truly revolutionary innovations; the adoption of in-plane inductor–capacitor (LC) switching modes and the introduction of organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs) provide examples in which a complete redesign of the display was needed, which in turn provided outstanding advantages in panel performance.\n\nAmong these revolutionary changes, the use of transparent oxide semiconductors in place of amorphous or polycrystalline silicon in active-matrix (AM) backplanes has been one of the most dramatic. Although oxide semiconductors have been known and studied for many decades, their use in thin-film transistor (TFT) channels was regarded as impractical before the advances in understanding and materials design that were achieved toward the end of the twentieth century. Once the underlying science was established, the pace at which these novel materials have been introduced into a wide range of commercial products is exceptional. The lead editor of this volume, Professor Hosono, may be regarded as the father of this renaissance in oxide semiconductor technology, due to his decisive contributions to the basic science, technology, and exploitation of new oxide materials. Now, oxide TFTs offer many advantages; they can be fabricated at low temperature and without costly laser annealing, while their high mobility provides routes to higher-resolution displays, faster frame rates, and higher optical power efficiency.\n\nThe wide bandgap of oxide systems promotes extremely low leakage currents and allows fabrication of transparent TFT arrays. The impact of oxide backplanes on the user's experience of modern displays is also profound, including a leap forward in image quality combined in many cases with reduced power drain.\n\nThe development of this new semiconductor class has brought many difficulties, some of which have been overcome while others continue to provide challenges and opportunities to the community. Among the outstanding issues, the difficulty of obtaining high performance in p-type oxide channels is of greater importance, as oxide devices are applied to more complex circuitry for memory, logic, and processing tasks outside the display driver array. Nevertheless, the advantages of oxide devices make such \"system-on-panel\" integration highly attractive. In the present volume, the editors, Professors Hosono and Hideya Kumomi, have brought together a comprehensive and authoritative collection of contributions from leading scientists in the field, which cover all the important topics touching advanced oxide semiconductors—materials design, electronic properties, characterization and modeling, device design, performance and stability, systems integration, new applications, and the challenges of applying oxide components to new-generation devices on plastic and other flexible substrates. The chapters go beyond the well-established applications of oxide systems to critically examine remaining challenges, such as prospects for oxide-based complementary metal-oxide semiconductors (CMOSs) and alternative circuit architectures as well as applications of oxide to other large-area electronic applications.\n\nThe trend to use oxide backplanes in displays is set to accelerate and broaden into new application areas that will place more and more stringent demands on AM components and their peripherals. Oxide TFTs will also find increased use in nondisplay devices. As these trends develop, this book will provide a ready and invaluable source of reference for all those studying, applying, and exploiting oxide semiconductors.\n\n❦ ❦\n\n## About The Editors\n\nHideo Hosono is an honorary professor and the founding director of the Materials Research Center for Element Strategy (MCES) of Tokyo Institute of Technology, and a distinguished fellow of the National Institute of Materials Science (NIMS).

This discrimination is performed by X-ray diffraction. Amorphous materials have several distinct advantages over crystalline materials. Large-sized and homogeneous (grain-boundary-free) thin films can be easily fabricated at low temperatures. In addition, material properties may be tuned by varying the chemical composition because there is no limitation to compound formations.\n\nThe essence of semiconductors is controllability of the Fermi level (EF) by intentional operations such as impurity doping and biasing. If the advantage of amorphous materials and the essence of semiconductors could be merged, the resulting amorphous semiconductor should be an ideal semiconductor for giant microelectronics represented by flat-panel displays, as illustrated in Figure 1.1.1.\n\nHowever, the amorphous semiconductors reported so far are far from this ideal owing to the high concentration of defects (chemical disorders) and tail states (localized states induced by structural randomness). Figure 1.1.2 shows a schematic drawing of electronic states. Since these defects and tail states work as charge-trapping sites, control of the Fermi level is generally impossible in amorphous semiconductors. As a consequence, charge transport is restricted to hopping among localized state like amorphous chalcogenides and semiconducting oxide glasses based on V2O5. The requirements for semiconductor thin-film transistor (TFT) channels are rather severe compared with the conventional semiconducting nature. Although these amorphous semiconductors do not work as TFT channels due to their high localized state density, amorphous hydrogenated Si (a-Si:H) is the first amorphous semiconductor in which EF is controllable by biasing. This is the primary reason why a-Si:H has attracted much attention. A large reduction of dangling bonds giving a midgap level by passivation with hydrogen makes it possible to shift EF to band edges, but EF cannot exceed mobility edges. Thus, the mobility of a-Si:H TFTs remains 0.5–1 cm2/(Vs), which is lower by two orders of magnitude than that of polycrystalline Si-TFTs.\n\nTransparent amorphous oxide semiconductors (TAOSs) based on post transition metal (PTM) oxides are the first category of amorphous semiconductors in which EF is controllable beyond the mobility edge in the conduction band. As a result, TAOS-TFTs exhibit large mobility, >10 cm2/(Vs), which is comparable to that in the corresponding polycrystalline thin films. What is the origin of such a favorable property of TAOSs? This is one focus of this chapter.\n\n❦ ❦\n\n![24_image_0.png](24_image_0.png)\n\n![24_image_1.png](24_image_1.png)\n\n❦ ❦\n\n## 1.1.2 Historical Overview\n\nThe history of oxide semiconductors is rather long. Transition metal–based oxides were traditional semiconductors, and so many papers on this topic have been published to date. However, as far as the author knows, neither of them works as the channel layer of TFTs. Transition metal cations have an open-shell structure in their d orbitals and give visible absorption originating from a d-d transition. Since these vacant d levels give large densities of states\n(DOSs) in the gap, it is hard to shift the EF to significantly exceed these DOSs. This is the reason why transition metal–oxide semiconductors do not work as TFTs. As described in Section 1.1.1, requirements for semiconductors in TFT channels are much more severe than those for p-n junction formation, because the EF is needed to shift to valence band maximum (VBM) or conduction band maximum (CBM) by gate voltage. A representative example is Cu2O, which is well known as a p-type semiconductor with high Hall mobility (∼100 cm2/Vs), but its TFT has not operated well (even now) since the first attempt by William Shockley in 1949.\n\nFigure 1.1.3 summarizes the history of oxide TFTs and their relevant TFT technology. The first TFT device structure was proposed in 1926 by Julius Lilienfeld as a patent. Oxide semiconductor TFTs have a long history comparable to that of Si metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs).

Research on ZnO-TFTs was revisited extensively by many groups. Among them is a noteworthy paper in 2001 by Ohya et al.,\nwho reported on ZnO-TFTs that were prepared by solution process (i.e., drop-coating of Zn(CH3COO)2 solution and subsequent heating in air) [1]. This is the first report on oxide TFTs fabricated by nonvacuum processes.\n\nSince oxide semiconductors are chemically stable in an ambient atmosphere at elevated temperature, unlike conventional semiconductors, this approach utilizing this intrinsic nature of material became a milestone in the fabrication of solution-derived oxide TFTs, which is now an active subject. Many papers on ZnO-TFTs deposited by sputtering or pulsed-laser deposition were reported [2], but serious issues—such as poor reproducibility and large hysteresis, arising mainly from the complex grain-boundary nature—were pointed out.\n\nA design concept and several examples of TAOSs with large electron mobility were proposed in 1996 [3]. As for TFTs with amorphous oxides, in 1993 Adkins et al. examined field modulation on amorphous InOx and reported a current on/off ratio of 2–3 [4]. Such a small on/off ratio comes from high carrier concentration. Suppression and carrier concentrations and stabilization of a low carrier state in a-InOx are still challenging even now.\n\nGood-performance AOS-TFTs were reported for IGZO [5] in 2004 and ZnSnOx [6] in 2005. Since then, a variety of AOS-TFTs have been reported to date [7].\n\nIn contrast to n-channel AOS-TFTs, the progress in p-channel has been much slower, and no satisfactory devices have been realized to date. Although a series of p-type transparent oxide semiconductors have been reported since 1997 [8], none of them works as a good TFT channel like Cu2O. The formation of high-density surface defects arising from oxidation of Cu+ is likely responsible for this. P-channel oxide TFTs were first realized in SnO [9]\nin 2008, and all complementary metal-oxide semiconductors (CMOSs) were reported [10] in 2011 utilizing the ambipolar nature of SnO. The performance of SnO-TFTs is still insufficient for practical application [11]. As for amorphous p-channel TFTs, very few have been reported [12] as far as the author knows. An amorphous oxide p-n junction using p-ZnRhOx/n-IGZO exhibiting clear rectifying characteristics was reported [13] in 2003, but amorphous ZnRhOx did not work as a p-channel TFT like a-vanadium-based oxides. High midgap state density arising from a d orbital would hinder the smooth EF shift by gating.\n\n❦ ❦\n\n![26_image_0.png](26_image_0.png)\n\n## 1.1.3 Oxide And Silicon\n\nOxide semiconductors made of typical metals are, in general, n-types except for several materials. This is a natural consequence of the chemical-bonding nature of oxides. Figure 1.1.4 shows schematic energy diagrams of ionic oxides and silicon. In ionic oxides, the nature of the CBM, which works as an electron pathway, totally differs from that of the VBM, which works as a hole pathway. The CBM in ionic oxides is primarily composed of unoccupied s orbitals of cations, and the contribution of oxygen 2p orbitals is limited. The spatial spread of this unoccupied s orbital is so large that direct overlap between the s orbitals of the neighboring cations is possible in PTM oxides; therefore, an effective mass of electrons is small in these oxides. In fact, some ionic oxides satisfy such situations with large electron mobilities of up to ∼100 cm2(Vs)−1 and are called transparent conductive oxides (TCOs) represented by In2O3, SnO2, ZnO, and Ga2O3. N-type material can be realized with a proper choice of metal cation, but p-type material is difficult because oxygen 2p orbitals are generally localized at the VBM.\n\n❦ ❦\n\n## 1.1.4 Transparent Amorphous Oxide Semiconductors 1.1.4.1 Electronic Structures\n\nWhat happens if these TCO materials become an amorphous state? In an amorphous state, structural disorder concentrates on an energetically weak structural unit. In most amorphous materials, structural disorder appears prominently as the bond-angle distribution. When the bond angle has a large distribution, how is the effective mass (i.e., the transfer rate between neighboring cation s orbitals or overlap integrals) modified for carrier electrons?\n\nWe considered the two cases: (i) covalent semiconductors and (ii) ionic semiconductors. In the former case, the magnitude of the overlap between the unoccupied orbitals of the neighboring atoms is very sensitive to the variation in bond angle. As a consequence, rather deep localized states would be created at somewhat high concentrations; thereby, the drift mobility would be largely degraded.\n\nOn the other hand, the magnitude of the overlap in the latter case is critically different depending on the choice of metal cations; when the spatial spread of the s orbital is larger than the inter-cation distance, the magnitude should be insensitive to the bond-angle distribution because the s orbitals are isotropic in shape. As a consequence, we may anticipate that these ionic amorphous materials have large electron mobility comparable to that\n\n![27_image_0.png](27_image_0.png)\n\n❦ ❦\nin the corresponding crystalline phase. In the case that the spatial spread of the metal s orbital is small, such a favorable situation cannot be expected [3, 12]. The spatial spread of the s orbital of a metal cation is primarily determined by the principal quantum number (n) and is modified by the charge state of the cation, as discussed for the crystalline TCOs. Thus, candidates for high-mobility TAOSs are found in oxides of PTM cations with an electronic configuration of (n−1)d10ns0, where n ≥ 5 [3, 12] (for crystalline oxide semiconductors, this requirement is relaxed to n ≥ 4, as exemplified by ZnO with the (3d)\n10(4s)\n0 configuration). Figure 1.1.5a shows the difference in orbitals between Si and a PTM oxide and between crystalline and amorphous states. The drastic reduction of the electron mobility in the amorphous state from c-Si may be understood intuitively from that figure, whereas mobility in c-PTM oxides is reserved even in the amorphous state. In a sense, the situation of the CBM in PTM\noxides is similar to that in amorphous metal alloys (conductivity is slightly lower than that in crystalline alloys),\nbecause metal orbitals dominantly constitute the electron pathways. This simple idea is demonstrated quantitatively by observing the DOS by inverse photoelectron spectroscopy and analyzing the computed DOS on atomic positions determined by a combination of X-ray radial distribution function with reverse Monte Carlo simulation.\n\nFigure 1.1.5b illustrates the connectivity of Cd 5s orbitals at the CBM of amorphous 2CdO-GeO2 as an example of TAOS. Here, Cd2+ with (4d)\n10(5s)\n0 meets the requirement for a PTM cation. Here, two Cd2+ ions were connected by a line for visualization of orbital overlap when a 2×Cd 5s orbital radius (Slater) is larger than the interatomic separation. It is clearly observed that the lines are 3D-connected throughout the sample, forming a percolated electron pathway [12].\n\n## 1.1.4.2 Materials\n\nDue to the requirements discussed in this chapter for high-mobility oxides, major TAOS materials need to contain In3+ or Sn4+, each of which have a (4d)\n10(5s)\n0 configuration, and its amount is required to be beyond the percolation threshold of its 5s orbitals at the CBM. There is a distinct difference between In and Sn in oxide materials.\n\nThe valence state of In is stable at +3, while Sn takes two charge states, +4 and +2, depending on its environment. Since the filled 5sstates are located at above VBM, Sn2+ with a 5s2 configuration does not work, unlike Sn4+. TAOS materials with many different compositions have been reported to date, and the materials that work as excellent TFT channels are almost restricted to In- and/or Sn-containing systems.\n\nHere, a-In-Ga-Zn-O (a-IGZO) [3, 14] is taken as a representative TAOS material. In a-IGZO, the In3+ ions contribute to a large electron mobility, and thus are called \"mobility enhancers.\" Ga with larger ionic strength (ionic charge/ionic radius) forms a stronger chemical bond with oxygen and suppresses the formation of oxygen deficiency and the generation of conduction electrons, and thus it is called a \"stabilizer\" or \"suppressor.\" The role of Zn taking tetrahedral coordination is not clear but is expected to stabilize amorphous structure; this is known in glass science as a \"network former.\" Therefore, increasing the In content increases the electron mobility but also increases residual electron density and tends to cause negative threshold voltage (Vth) in TFTs. Addition of a suppressor like Ga reduces the electron density (Ne) if the same deposition condition is employed, but it decreases the electron mobility. The decrease in mobility is caused by two factors: (i) reduction of the In content and (ii) reduction of electron mobility due to the small Ne, as will be explained further in this chapter. Pure In2O3 and ZnO do not form stable amorphous structures, even if deposited at room temperature (RT) without substrate heating. Mixing of two or more metal cations is thus necessary to stabilize the amorphous structure. TAOS materials for TFT channels are made from a combination of mobility enhancers and suppressors. The first material is a-IGZO with the nominal atomic ratio of In:Ga:Zn = 1:1:1 (called \"111\" composition), and also another composition of In:Ga:Zn = 2:2:1 (\"221\" composition) has been examined. Oregon State University (OSU) and the HP group [6] proposed Zn-Sn-O (ZTO) and Zn-In-O (ZIO) TFTs just after the first report of a-IGZO TFTs, which exhibited high μTFT > 50 cm2/(Vs) by annealing at 600 ∘C. A variety of combinations have been reported for TAOS-TFTs. TAOS materials containing In3+ and Sn4+ were also reported as ITZO (In-Sn-Zn-O). The advantages of ITZO TFTs are high (μTFT > 30 cm2(Vs)−1), and they have good robustness and selectivity against wet etching for backchannel etched TFTs. In contrast, ITZO requires high oxygen partial pressure during sputtering to suppress the electron density so as to fit to normally off TFTs, but the high PO2 condition deteriorates the deposition rate seriously. It is proposed that the addition of water to the sputtering atmosphere improves this issue.\n\nTFT mobility and stability are in a trade-off relationship in many cases. A typical example is a-IZO (ZnO content 10%) material. The amorphous structure of In2O3 is much stabilized by the incorporation of ZnO, and μHall does not degrade. Conventionally sputtered thin films of this TAOS material are used as amorphous TCOs (transparent metal), not semiconductors. When IZO is sputtered in highly oxidizing conditions, the thin films with low enough\n❦ ❦\nNe to use as a TFT channel layer can be fabricated. TFTs based on such a thin film exhibit high μFE, such as 50 cm2/(Vs), and the off-current continuously increases with time and eventually loses device performance.\n\n## 1.1.4.3 Characteristic Carrier Transport Properties\n\nTAOS has several common and unique properties that are not seen in conventional amorphous semiconductors\n[14]. First are their large electron mobilities > 10 cm2(Vs)−1, which are higher by 1–2 orders of magnitude than those in a-Si:H. Second is that a degenerate state can be realized. This is totally different from the other amorphous semiconductors. For instance, c-Si is easily changed to the degenerate state by impurity doping (∼1016 cm−3), but no such state is attained in a-Si:H. That is, carrier conduction takes place by hopping through localized tail states in conventional amorphous semiconductors. This is the reason why mobility in the amorphous state is so small compared with that in the crystalline state. On the other hand, in TAOS, the EF can exceed the mobility gap easily by carrier doping, leading to band conduction. It is considered that this striking difference originates from that in the chemical-bonding nature between the materials (i.e., strong ionic bonding with spherical potential is very favorable to forming a shallow tail state with a small DOS).\n\nHall effect measurements, which are a standard method in crystalline semiconductors, cannot be used for amorphous semiconductors. The reason is that the mean free path is so short, being comparable to or smaller than interatomic separation. On the contrary, TAOS materials give distinct Hall voltages, and the evaluated Ne and mobility of carriers are reliable because the mean free path is several nanometers, which is much larger than the interatomic separation. Carrier transport properties of a-IGZO are shown in Figure 1.1.6 as an example of TAOS. It is noted that mobility (μHall) largely depends on Ne due to the presence of potential barriers arising from structural disorder. μHall increases with increasing Ne and finally exceeds 10 cm2(Vs) −1 if Ne exceeds ∼1018 cm−3. The activation energy of mobility is continuously decreased with Ne, and eventually the degenerate state is realized at Ne = 1019–1020cm−3. This μHall versus Ne behavior is explained by the percolation conduction model, in which\n❦ ❦\n\n![29_image_0.png](29_image_0.png)\n\n10 *1.1 Transparent Amorphous Oxide Semiconductors for Display Applications*\nelectron transport is controlled by distributed potential barriers above CBM (Figure 1.1.6c) [15–17]. If the TAOS\nis very defective or with very low Ne, hopping conduction would be dominant.\n\n## 1.1.4.4 Electronic States\n\nTFTs are devices in which source–drain current is modulated by applying a voltage to the gate insulator over several to ten orders of magnitude, as shown in Figure 1.1.7. Thus, both the density of in-gap state and the tail state are called subgap states hereafter; n-channel semiconductors are critical for TFT applications because these states work as carrier traps. The dominant factor of μFE is partly different from that of μHall because μFE is expressed roughly by μHall (Nind − Ntrap) / Nind, where Nind is the total electron density induced by the gate voltage and Ntrap is the density of the induced electrons trapped by subgap defects and tail states. Therefore, low Ntrap is important to obtain high μFE, and the low Ntrap is confirmed by TFT analyses, coefficient of variation (C-V) analyses, and so on, as shown in Figure 1.1.8. These studies have revealed that these localized state densities in TAOSs are\n\n![30_image_0.png](30_image_0.png)\n\n❦ ❦\n\n![30_image_1.png](30_image_1.png)\n\n2–3 orders of magnitude smaller than that of a-Si:H where EF is close to CBM. This striking difference is the main reason why the band conduction can be induced in TAOS but not in a-Si:H by biasing gate voltage. (Bob Street [18]\nsuccessfully explained why EF cannot exceed the mobility gap.) The low Ntrap is explained also by the electronic structure specific to the high ionicity of TAOS; that is, since Coulombic potential is independent on angle, the energy level is very insensitive to the variation in bond angle, which is the dominant randomness in amorphous materials, compared with the potential in a covalent bond. Thus, tail state density in TAOS is much lower than that in a-Si:H.\n\nFigure 1.1.9 illustrates these electronic structures of a-IGZO [14]. Noteworthy is the presence of a large DOS\n(1019–20cm−3) above the VBM. This DOS was first observed [19] for thin films by hard X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (HAX-PES) using a synchrotron radiation facility (6–8 keV). HAX-PES has two advantages over conventional lab-PES; the first is to be bulk sensitive originating from the large escape depth of the photoelectron.\n\nThis makes it possible to get reliable information from as-prepared thin films without any surface treatment such as sputtering. The other is large ionization cross-section for s-state electrons, which are associated with oxygen vacancy, hydrogen anions, and low valence cations with ns2 electron configurations such as In+ and Ga+. Since this DOS is located above the VBM and far below the EF, an n-channel TFT operation does not suffer from their influence, fortunately. However, this DOS plays a critical role in energy saving of the devices and TFT degradation under the dominant operation mode (negative bias under illumination stress [NBIS]), which is called NBIS\ninstability. The EF cannot push down under negative gate voltage due to the presence of this large DOS (i.e., the p-channel does not open when negative bias is applied). This feature makes a contrast with a-Si:H TFTs, which show ambipolar operation (i.e., the drain current is increased when negative bias is further applied to the gate).\n\nSince TFTs for LCDs dominantly stay in an off-state, the unipolarity of TAOS-TFTs leads to energy saving. This is the reason why low off-currents of IGZO-TFTs are much lower than those of a-Si:H and low-temperature processed polysilicon (LTPS)-TFTs.\n\nThis large DOS above the VBM works as the source of NBIS instability, which is induced by subgap light illumination under negative bias. The electron in the DOS is excited to the CBM by subgap illumination. The electron\n❦ ❦\n\n![31_image_0.png](31_image_0.png)\n\n![32_image_0.png](32_image_0.png)\n\nexcited to the CBM is easily diffused away due to the high electron mobility at the CBM, while the remaining hole drifts to the interface between the channel and the gate insulator and is trapped there to form a fixed positive charge. As a result, the threshold voltage shifts to the negative voltage side. NBIS instability [20] was first reported in polycrystalline ZnO-TFTs and was found in almost all of the n-type oxide TFTs, irrespective of whether they were crystalline or amorphous. This suppression is an important issue for practical application of oxide-TFTs for displays because the threshold voltage shifts result in output current changes, in particular for OLEDs, which are driven by current.\n\nFigure 1.1.10 summarizes the progress of IGZO-TFTs and their application to the backplanes of flat-panel displays in smartphones, tablet PCs, PC monitors, and OLED-TVs period. The first reported IGZO-TFTs were based on epitaxial thin films, and their mobility was ∼80 cm2/(Vs) [21], which is comparable to that of poly-Si TFTs. Amorphous IGZO-TFTs fabricated on plastic substrates were published in 2004, and the mobility was ∼10 cm2/(Vs) [5].\n\nIt is obvious from Section 1.1.4.2 that the ratio of Ga to In controls the mobility and stability. A higher In fraction enhances mobility while reducing the stability. A key reason why IGZO-TFTs are widely applied to displays is that since this composition forms a stable crystalline phase, large-sized and dense ceramics can be obtained easily for sputtering targets [22]. Large-sized OLED-TVs are driven by a-IGZO-TFTs. Two major features of a-IGZO-TFTs, high mobility and excellent homogeneity over a large size, are fully utilized in these products.\n\n## 1.1.5 P-Type Oxide Semiconductors For Display Applications\n\nN-Type transparent oxide semiconductors can be designed by selecting metal cations with spatially spread s orbitals that constitute the CBM and a crystalline structure with a smaller separation between metal cations, as illustrated in Figure 1.1.11a. However, no guidelines for designing p-type semiconductors were presented until 1997 [8]. Needless to say, p-n junctions are the origin of various semiconductor functions; therefore, high-quality p-type transparent semiconductors are essential for not only transparent oxide electronics but also all-solid dye-sensitized solar cells. For wide-gap oxides, the VBM, which serves as the conduction path of holes, is mainly composed of oxygen 2p orbitals, and the contribution of the orbitals of metal cations is generally small. Therefore, the VBM is little dispersed (i.e., the effective mass of holes is large), and the energy level is deep to dope holes.\n\nThis is why p-type transparent oxide semiconductors are difficult to realize. Resolving this problem is a key strategy in realizing p-type transparent oxide semiconductors. Three previously proposed approaches are given in this section.\n\n❦ ❦\n\n## 1.1.5.1 Oxides Of Transition Metal Cations With An Electronic Configuration Of (N−1)D10Ns0 (N = 4 Or 5)\n\nAlthough transition metal cations have orbitals with energy levels close to those of oxygen 2p orbitals, most of them absorb visible light owing to a d-d transition [23]. Therefore, oxides of cations with closed-shell d orbitals, such as Cu+ and Ag+, are considered to have the potential to exhibit p-type conductivity. As shown in Figure 1.1.11b, for such oxides, the antibonding orbital component of the bond composed of metal d orbitals and oxygen 2p orbitals constitutes the VBM, and the holes doped into the VBM are delocalized to realize p-type conductivity. A typical example is delafossite CuMO2 (M = Al3+, Ga3+, and In3+) with dumbbell-type O−Cu−O bonds as the building block. Although several p-type transparent semiconductors have been found to date, no good TFT operation based on Cu+ has been reported to date like the Cu2O case by Shockley. The high concentration of hole traps at the surface associated with oxidation of Cu+ would be the most plausible cause of these results.\n\n## 1.1.5.2 Oxides Of Metal Cations With An Electronic Configuration Of Ns2\n\nCations with an electronic configuration of ns2 have lone pairs similar to those of anions [9]. For the oxides of such metal cations, the VBM is mostly occupied by s orbitals, as shown in Figure 1.1.11c. Lone pairs occupy the\n\n![34_image_0.png](34_image_0.png)\n\n(c)\nspatially dispersed s orbitals, which overlap with the s orbitals of adjacent cations via the oxygen, forming a largely dispersed band above the oxygen 2p band. Oxides of Sn2+ with an electronic configuration of 5s2 are typical and exhibit p-type conductivity in Hall effect measurements. In addition, the first-ever oxide TFT that can operate as a p-channel TFT was realized using SnO for the active layers [9].\n\nThe realization of CMOS based on an oxide semiconductor was a long-standing issue in oxide electronics. This objective was first attained in 2011 using SnO [9]. Although much improvement has been reported [11, 24], the CMOS performance is still insufficient for applications. Low-temperature processing as well as improvement of mobility are strongly required for display applications.\n\nIt has been reported that chalocogenides and oxides of Pb2+ and Bi3+, both with an electronic configuration of 6s2, cannot be used to enhance hole transport properties because the energy level of 6s electrons is much deeper than that of the VBM. Although oxides of Sb3+ with an electronic configuration of 5s2, similar to that of Sn2+, are expected to exhibit p-type conductivity, no examples of such oxides have been reported to date.\n\n## 1.1.5.3 Oxides Of Metal Cations With An Electronic Configuration Of Nd6\n\nFor oxides of Rh3+ and Ir3+, both with an electronic configuration of 4d6 or 5d6, these cations stabilize in the low-spin-state octahedral configuration, where electrons occupy the three orbitals dxy, dyz, and dzx [25]. 4d and 5d orbitals are spatially spread, and the state in which two electrons occupy each of the three d orbitals is similar to that in Section 1.1.5.2, that is, a pseudo s orbital with a large spread. When doped with holes, these oxides are expected to exhibit p-type conductivity. A typical example is ZnRh2O4, which has a normal spinel structure [25]. Similar to the case of ZnO, the Zn2+ ions in this material are coordinated in tetrahedra, which are not continuously connected and do not exhibit n-type conductivity. ZnRh2O4 is the only oxide that is known to exhibit p-type conductivity even in the amorphous state, and it has been reported to form p-n diodes on plastic substrates [26] when combined with TAOS. Subsequently, p-type conductivity was reported for ZnCo2O4 as an extension of this series to the 3d6 system.\n\nThese materials work as p-type semiconductors for the p-n-junction but not as p-channel material in TFTs because of the high concentrations of vacant d levels, which serve as hole trapping in the band gap.\n\n## 1.1.6 Novel Amorphous Oxide Semiconductors\n\nRecently, two novel-type AOSs toward display applications were reported based on rather different design concepts: an amorphous electride (a-C12A7:e−) and amorphous ZnO-SiO2 (a-ZSO).\n\nElectrides are materials in which electrons serve as anions [27]. This conceptionally novel material was first synthesized in organic crystals. Although these attracted attention as an exotic material, almost no information had been obtained on the physical properties because they are extremely sensitive to heat, O2, and H2O.\n\nIn 2003, an inorganic electride material derived from 12CaO⋅7Al2O3 crystal (C12A7) was reported [28]. C12A7 is a wide-gap insulator composed of densely packed, subnanometer-sized cages with a positive charge, and it is thermally stable with a melting point of 1415 ∘C. The unit cell includes two molecules and 12 cages that have a free inner space of ∼0.4 nm in diameter and can be represented as [Ca24Al28O64]\n4+ + 2O2–. The former denotes the cage framework, and the latter is called \"free oxygen ions\" that compensate for the positive charge of the framework.\n\nThese oxygen ions are loosely bound to the cages because the cage diameter is ∼50% larger than the O2− size\n(0.28 nm). They succeeded in extracting this free O2− ion, regarded as the counter anion to the giant framework cation, by a chemical reduction method and injected electrons instead. Since the resulting material (hereafter, C12A7:e−) with the composition of [Ca24Al28O64]\n4+•(4e−) may be regarded as electride, this material became the first RT-stable electride.\n\nAmorphous C12A7:e− thin films were successfully fabricated by conventional sputtering of a C12A7:e− ceramic target in O2-free atmosphere, and the resulting thin films contain a high anionic electron concentration comparable to that in crystalline C12A7:e− [29]. Anionic electrons exist in subnanometer-sized space coordinated by 2 Al3+ or a Ca2+ and an Al3+. The work function of a-C12A7:e− is ∼3.0 eV, which is larger than that of c-C12A7:e−\n(2.4 eV) but still rather lower than that of conventional transparent oxide semiconductors (comparable to metal Ca), and it is chemically inert and optically transparent as shown in Figure 1.1.12. There are two types of OLEDs with different stacking, normal type (cathode top) and inverted type (cathode bottom). An inverted type is better than a normal one, as the device structure emitting light can radiate upward through a cathode of transparent electrode (indium tin oxide [ITO]). However, the fabrication of an inverted structure was practically hard due to the lack of an appropriate electron injection layer (EIL) because a combination of LiF and Al does not work for this structure (deposition sequence Al followed by LiF). An inverted structure of OLEDs with comparable performance to a normal structure was realized by using a-C12A7:e− with a low work function and high optical transparency as the EIL.\n\nSecond is a-ZSO, ZnO-SiO2. A ZSO thin film has a low work function (≈3.5 eV), which is lower by ∼1 eV than ZnO and also enables relatively higher mobility (0.3–1.0 cm2/(Vs)) than those of the n-type organic semiconductors [30]. In addition to high visible transparency and good chemical stability, a-ZSO can form ohmic contact with various metals irrespective of the work function of partner metals. These properties almost completely meet the requirements to be electron injection/transport layers in OLEDs and perovskite LEDs. The effectiveness of this semiconductor was demonstrated by the realization of high-performance perovskite LEDs [31], as shown in Figure 1.1.13, and efficient tandem OLEDs [32]. These exceptional properties originate from a characteristic nanostructure composed of ZnO nanocrystals separated by thin amorphous zinc silicate layers with larger ionization potential and smaller electron affinity than ZnO. This nanostructure makes it possible to confine wave function in ZnO nanocrystals, which in turn widens the band gap due to the quantum size effect. Since EF is\n❦ ❦\n\n![36_image_0.png](36_image_0.png)\n\n![36_image_1.png](36_image_1.png)\n\n![36_image_2.png](36_image_2.png)\n\nlocated at the CBM, this wide gap widening results in lower work function. ZnO nanocrystals in the material are conducting, due probably to the incorporation of Si to the Zn site, and they are not continuously connected by a thin insulating zinc silicate layer. Thus, mobility observed by hopping conduction through localized levels in the insulating zinc silicate layer is amply large compared with that of organic semiconductors used as the electron transport layer. This X-ray AOS is a kind of nanocomposite material utilizing the optical confinement effect of ZnO nanocrystals and electrically connected conducting ZnO nanocrystals connected by hopping conduction via a thin insulating ZnO-SiO2 layer.\n\n## 1.1.7 Summary And Outlook\n\nThis chapter outlines the background, fundamental understanding, and recent progress of AOSs for display applications in comparison with crystalline oxide semiconductors and amorphous silicon. An emphasis was placed on the electron transport and electronic structure of TAOSs represented by a-IGZO. Throughout this chapter, the author described design concepts based on a simple consideration of chemical bonding. The tremendous success of Si-based semiconductors has created splendid science and technology. Oxide semiconductors have a longer history than silicon semiconductors, but this had not led to practical device applications. IGZO-TFTs would be the first visible device application of oxide semiconductors. High-mobility TFTs using amorphous semiconductors are based on the intrinsic nature of p-block metal cation-based transparent oxides. Crystalline Si cannot meet the requirements for display technology, which needs large-sized thin films. Transparent amorphous oxide semiconductors have huge potential as backplane transistors for high-precision and energy-saving large-sized LCD panels.\n\nApplication to electron transport/injection layers, which is hard to overcome with the existing technology, may be expected by developing new oxide semiconductors. Oxide is only one semiconductor material that is stable in air at high temperature. Thus, fabricating oxide semiconductors derived from solution is a process allowed for only oxide material. Although the resulting devices are still insufficient in stability and performance, further technical progress would lead to new applications. Review articles [23, 24] are helpful to compensate for the lack of this discussion in the present chapter.\n\nFinally, the author would like to raise two technical challenges in transparent amorphous semiconductors:\n❦ ❦\n1. High-mobility p*-channel TFTs*: Oxides are unfavorable as p-type semiconductors. The deep energy level and highly localized nature of O 2p dominating the VBM make it hard to have high-mobility p-type conduction.\n\nRecently, transparent amorphous semiconductors with high mobility (∼10 cm2/Vs) were reported in the Cu-Sn-I system [33]. As shown in Figure 1.1.14, filled I 5p orbitals constituting the VBM with Cu 3d orbitals may be regarded as the vacant s orbital of PTM cations in n-type TAOSs. The hole concentration in these materials is too high to operate as TFTs with enough current on/off ratio. Reduction of carrier concentration without degrading mobility is the current issue. If this issue could be overcome, good-performance transparent CMOS devices are possible with a combination with n-TAOS TFTs.\n\n2. *High-mobility and high-stability TAOS-TFTs*: Amorphous IGZO-TFTs are now widely applied to flat-panel displays, replacing a-Si:H-TFTs. However, higher mobility TAOS-TFTs are demanded for circuit applications.\n\nIt is well known that there is a phenomenological observation between mobility and stability (to various stresses) in oxide TFTs. Higher mobility TFTs are obtained in In-rich and/or In-Sn-based TAOSs such as InOx and In-Sn-Zn-O, but each of these TFTs is sensitive to stress (voltage, light, heat, and their combinations).\n\nElucidation of the origin for this trade-off should give an effective clue to resolve the issue.\n\nMaterials science of TAOSs has greatly advanced in both fundamentals and device applications in the last two decades. A strong demand for new applications will be the engine to facilitate breadth in this area. There are several excellent review articles and monographs [34–39] on this subject, including those already cited in this chapter. The author encourages the reader to check these reviews if necessary. Very recently, a model from the trade-off described above was proposed and high mobility-highly stable a-ITZO TFTs were reported [41].\n\n![38_image_0.png](38_image_0.png)\n\nFigure 1.1.14 Amorphous Cu-Sn-I.

Although the manufacturer did not disclose this detail, a small number of the high-resolution\n(264 ppi) 9.7-inch-diagonal AM-LCD panels on their tablet PC devices (Apple iPad 3) [2] was driven by backplane circuits driven by AOSs, amorphous In-Ga-Zn-O (a-IGZO) TFTs. After that, the a-IGZO-TFTs were successively commercialized in the AM-LCD screens of smartphones, PC monitors, laptop PCs, and active-matrix organic light-emitting diode (AM-OLED) displays for smartwatches and large-area (up to 88 inches diagonally)\nand high-resolution (8k×4k) television (TV) screens. Furthermore, even flexible and rollable AM-OLED TVs were launched in October 2020, and a-IGZO-TFT-based TVs dominate the AM-OLED TV market. Nowadays, AOS-TFTs have become indispensable component devices for driving active-matrix flat-panel displays (AM-FPDs), along with conventional hydrogenated amorphous Si (a-Si:H) TFTs and low-temperature polycrystalline Si (LTPS) TFTs.\n\nIt is noteworthy that, even after a half-century incubation of oxide TFTs, a-IGZO-TFTs had been commercialized by rapid research and development in a short period of eight years from their first demonstration. It is generally difficult for such a novel and exotic oxide material composed of ternary metal cations to be thrust into an existing industry of established Si-based technologies and to replace a part of them with AOS-TFTs due to both technical and business issues. There are some reasons for the success of a-IGZO-TFTs, and these are discussed and elucidated in this chapter based on the technical requirements of electronics industries, along with a historical review of oxide semiconductor–based TFTs and their uniqueness.\n\n❦ ❦\n\n## 1.2.2 Technical Issues And Requirements Of Tfts For Am-Fpds 1.2.2.1 Field-Effect Mobility\n\nAM-LCDs at their dawn can be sufficiently driven by a-Si:H TFTs that have a small field-effect mobility of FE\n∼0.1 cm2V−1s−1 because of their low resolutions (i.e., large pixel size), small panel dimensions, and slow frame rates. The eff had been enhanced up to ∼1 cm2V−1s−1 by improving a-Si:H materials, device structures, and fabrication processes to meet the requirements of increasing these specifications and creating greater color depth.\n\nHowever, much higher mobility was required from the beginning of the twenty-first century, when screens larger than 50 inches diagonally and with a higher frame rate than 60 Hz for smooth rendering of movies were demanded by markets. Total capacitance,C, of parasitic capacitance of switching TFTs (TSW) is mainly caused by source–drain\n\n![42_image_0.png](42_image_0.png)\n\n❦ ❦\nand gate electrodes overlapping, and the storage capacitors in all pixels and so on are parallelly hung on gate\n(scan)-line metal wirings. Signal transmission from the starting to the ending pixels on a single gate-line must be accompanied by delays with a time constant of RC, where R represents a finite resistance of gate-line wiring determined by the wiring metal materials and their length and cross-sectional areas. This gate-line delay cannot exceed the inverse of the frame rate (i.e., the interval to scan the next gate-line). It is necessary to more rapidly charge the pixel capacitance by enhancing the current driving performance of TSW in order to reduce the gate-line delay.\n\nFigure 1.2.1 is a historical plot showing dependence of the least mobilities of TSW to drive a 50-inch-diagonal AM-LCD model with 5-μm-wide Cu gate-line wiring, calculated by Yojiro Matsueda in 2010 [3]. It is estimated here that at least a mobility of ∼10 cm2V−1s−1 is required to drive 8k×4k panels by a single scan at 120 Hz, which cannot be achieved by the latest high-end a-Si:H TFTs. LTPS-TFTs exhibit high mobilities of ∼50–100 cm2V−1s−1 even when their polycrystalline grain size is far smaller than the TFT channel dimensions to suppress the spatial variety of the TFT properties caused by grain-boundary effects. However, LTPS-TFTs still have difficulties with both short- and long-range uniformity.\n\nIn cases of current-driving light-emitting diode (LED) devices like AM-OLEDs, the requirements for driving TFTs (TDR) are added to those for TSW. Various estimations suggest that a mobility of ∼10 cm2V−1s−1 is required for TDR to provide sufficient current to the directly connected LED component for sufficient visual brightness independent of FPD resolution and size. This cannot be achieved by a-Si:H TFTs, and thus AM-OLEDs had been produced only for the small-sized panels of smartphones using LTPS-TFT backplanes. Active-matrix electrochromic (EC)\ndisplays also happen to require TFTs with a mobility of ∼10 cm2V−1s−1 to rapidly charge the EC cells, although they have not been commercialized so far.\n\nMonolithic implementation of peripheral circuits (composed of TFTs like shift-registers for scanning gate-lines and demultiplexers for dividing data signals into RGB subpixels) becomes necessary if the aim is super-high resolution in small panels when it becomes difficult to implement Si-based integrated circuit (IC) chips on the peripherals of AM-FPDs and connect them to the backplane circuits. Especially in mobile devices, the footprint of TFT-based peripheral circuits should be as small as possible to realize narrow-border frame configurations, and a TFT mobility of ∼10–50 cm2V−1s−1 is required to reduce the channel width of the TFTs.\n\n## 1.2.2.2 Off-State Leakage Current And On/Off Current Ratio\n\nThe TSW of AM-FPDs stays in the off-state for most of a frame time after completing the scanning of the gate-line that the TSW is hung on, until the scanning of the gate-line restarts for the next frame. For example, in 8k×4k panels, the TSW remains off for 3,839/3,840 of the time under a relatively high depletion gate bias. Leakage current of the TSW in the off-state should be suppressed to be lower than the reduction of charges in the storage capacitor in one pixel, so as to suppress a change of tone within one bit of color depth. LTPS-TFTs usually exhibit high off-state leakage current and also suffer from inversion operation at a high depletion gate bias; therefore, researchers have attempted to solve this problem by improving their device structures and circuit designs. However, some recent mobile devices try to suppress their power consumption by reducing their frame rate lower than 30 Hz and their power consumption in their peripheral circuits. The lowest frame rate achieved by the LTPS-TFT backplane is only 10 Hz, while AOS-TFTs can easily realize lower than 1 Hz owing to their extremely low off-state leakage current, as described later in this chapter. This feature of low off-state current in AOS-TFTs is actually applied to some mobile products such as smartphones and smartwatches.\n\nBoth high mobility and low off-state leakage current lead to enhancement of the on/off current ratio of TFTs.\n\nThe on/off current ratio should be as large as needed to express necessary color depth if the imaging components are driven by analog control of bias or current. The current standard color depth of eight bits for each primary color has been achieved by conventional Si-based TFTs. However, when higher color depth or a wider color gamut is required, TFTs with a higher on/off current ratio become necessary.\n\n## ❦ ❦ 1.2.2.3 Stability And Reliability\n\nTFTs driving AM-FPDs must be stable and reliable against electrical (and thermal) stresses caused by their operation, in addition to thermal, mechanical, and chemical stresses from the environment in electrical devices. The TSW and TDR mainly suffer gate-voltage bias stress and source-to-drain current stress, respectively, and they deteriorate with shifts of TFT characteristics such as threshold voltage, on/off current, and subthreshold swing. TFTs in peripheral circuits are also exposed to various stresses. Some of these shifts can be canceled by special compensation circuits, although the compensation range is limited. Especially in a pixel circuit of AM-OLEDs, characteristics of the OLED component also shift with light-emitting operation, and it is necessary to compensate the characteristic shifts of both TFTs and OLEDs by the compensation circuit composed of the same TFTs. It is very difficult to drive AM-OLEDs with a backplane circuit based on unstable a-Si:H TFTs, in addition to the difficulty in driving OLEDs with their small mobilities. Therefore, early products of AM-OLED displays were driven by backplane circuits composed of stable LTPS-TFTs, which limit mother-glass sizes (smaller than generation 6 [Gen. 6])\nin mass production and thus final panel sizes up to several inches in diagonal.\n\n## 1.2.2.4 Uniformity\n\nCharacteristics of TFTs driving AM-FPDs should be uniform over their panel dimension to guarantee uniform brightness, colors, and tone rendering. Spatial variations of characteristics of LTPS-TFTs are relatively large due to the in-plane inhomogeneity of polycrystalline grain boundaries, where carrier transfer is hindered by high potential barriers, and the short-range uniformity among neighboring TFTs is not good. Neither is the long-range uniformity between distant TFTs over panel dimensions because of the inhomogeneous formation process with scanning a line-shaped and short-pulsed excimer-laser annealing (ELA) for the melting and recrystallization process of a-Si thin films. On the other hand, a-Si:H TFTs show good uniformity in both short and long ranges owing to their amorphous nature, with no grain boundaries or film formation by plasma-enhanced chemical-vapor deposition (PECVD). Therefore, middle- and large-area (≳10 inches in diagonal) AM-FPDs have been driven by a-Si:H\nTFT–based backplanes.\n\n## 1.2.2.5 Large-Area Devices By Large-Area Mother-Glass Substrates\n\nIn addition to the uniformity issues in LTPS-TFTs that have been discussed so far in this chapter, there is another reason for difficulty in enlarging mother glasses beyond Gen. 6, and thus in enlarging the final panel size over several inches in diagonal in mass production. In the fabrication processes of LTPS-TFTs, a-Si:H thin films are formed over glass substrates by PECVD first, and then the high-density hydrogens in the films have to be removed\n(dehydrogenation) before the subsequent ELA process to avoid explosion of the films by hydrogen vaporization.\n\nThe dehydrogenation requires thermal annealing for several hours at a temperature higher than ∼450 ∘C. The high-temperature annealing demands special and expensive glass substrates with very small thermal deformation, but these are not available for mother glasses larger than Gen. 6. Furthermore, it is also difficult to expand the length of line-shaped excimer-laser beams in ELA beyond the dimension of the Gen. 6 mother glasses. Because the cost of an AM-FPD panel is most strongly determined by the number of panels cropped from one mother glass, AM-FPD panel products based on LTPS-TFTs are limited to small-sized (a few to several inches in diagonal) ones, such as those for smartphones.\n\nMother-glass substrates larger than Gen. 6 (up to >10) had been available to a-Si:H TFTs, because the highest process temperature is ∼350 ∘C in PECVD of a-Si:H thin films and gate-insulator films, and there is no limitation to substrate sizes in PECVD. Large-sized AM-FPDs had been supplied exclusively with backplanes based on a-Si:H\nTFTs. As mentioned in this chapter, however, there are many AM-FPDs that cannot be driven by a-Si:H TFTs, and these had not been commercialized.\n\n❦ ❦\n\n## 1.2.2.6 Low-Temperature Fabrication And Flexibility\n\nA far lower fabrication-processing temperature than ∼350 ∘C is indispensable if substrates are not heat-resistant.\n\nMost of the substrates based on polymer plastic sheets for flexible devices cannot endure thermal stresses at temperatures higher than ∼200 ∘C. Some emerging semiconductor materials, such as organic molecules, carbon nanotubes, graphene, transition metal dichalcogenide, halide perovskite, and so on, could be fabricated at low temperatures down to room temperature, but none of them can meet the other requirements mentioned here.\n\nCharacteristics of TFTs on flexible devices also have to be stable under fixed or repeated mechanical stresses of bending. Curved or foldable AM-OLED panels driven by LTPS-TFTs are commercialized on smartphones, but further flexible products with rollable panels have not been launched until recently.\n\n## 1.2.3 History, Features, Uniqueness, Development, And Applications Of Aos-Tfts 1.2.3.1 History\n\nIn 1939, William Shockley attempted a demonstration of transistors using Cu2O [4], which is regarded as the earliest challenge to oxide semiconductor–based active devices. Unfortunately, the Cu2O transistor never operated, so he changed the semiconductor material to germanium (Cu2O TFTs still do not operate, even in 2021). The first TFT was demonstrated in 1962 using a chalcogenide semiconductor, CdS [5]. The first TFTs using oxide semiconductors, SnO2 and In2O3, appeared in 1964 [6], which was two years earlier than the appearance of polycrystalline Si–based field-effect transistors (FETs) in 1966 [7]. FETs based on single-crystalline ZnO followed these pioneers as a demonstration of oxide semiconductor–based transistors in 1968 [8]. However, further followers have not appeared for more than three decades since then. This was probably due to a lack of killer applications of TFTs during that era. On the other hand, a-Si:H thin films emerged in the 1970s [9], and many researchers rushed into them because of their potential applications in backplane circuits for AM-FPDs and in photosensitive and photovoltaic devices, and because of scientific interest in their local and electronic structures. Since the first AM-LCD with an a-Si:H TFT backplane was proposed in 1981 [10], Si-based TFTs including polycrystalline Si TFTs dominated the commercialization of AM-FPDs for decades until quite recently. Thus, oxide TFTs had fallen into oblivion for a long time, while oxide semiconductors such as In-Sn-O have played an important role to date as conductors in applications with transparent electrodes.\n\nWhat re-ignited interest in oxide semiconductors was a working hypothesis, proposed in 1996, about candidate materials for high-mobility amorphous oxides [11]. The hypothesis predicts that oxides of post transition metals with an electronic configuration of (n−1)d10s0 could exhibit high electron mobility, even in amorphous phases. The actual material used in the operation of high-performance TFTs was demonstrated several years later. Meanwhile, oxide semiconductor–based TFTs were revived by aiming at AM-FPD applications via a demonstration of solution-processed polycrystalline ZnO-TFTs in 2001 [12], which was followed by sputter-deposited ZnO-TFTs by many researchers. However, ZnO-TFTs have not been commercialized so far because they cannot escape serious technical issues caused by polycrystalline grain boundaries, and a superior alternative appeared later. In 2003, Nomura *et al.* demonstrated that a multicomponent oxide TFT showed a high field-effect mobility of FE ∼80 cm2V−1s−1, using c-axis-oriented crystalline InGaO3(ZnO)5 (IGZO) thin films formed by reactive solid-phase epitaxy at high temperature [13]. During exploration of the candidates predicted by the working hypothesis [12], with an insight into electronic configurations and the role of Ga cations, this material system was discovered to be a high-mobility oxide semiconductor. Actually, the first AOS-TFTs were demonstrated in 2004 with FE ∼9 cm2V−1s−1, using amorphous In-Ga-Zn-O (a-IGZO) thin films deposited on plastic substrates at room temperature [14].\n\nAOS-TFTs have attracted keen attention, mainly because their channel mobilities are ∼10 times higher than those of conventional a-Si:H TFTs. After a few years since the first demonstration of a-IGZO-TFTs, an explosive increase in their research and development started, with numerous publications [15]. Finally, in 2012, after remaining in obscurity for over half a century since the first demonstration, the first commercial product based on AOS-TFTs was launched in the worldwide market in a small number of mobile electronic devices. Since then, a-IGZO-TFTs have been mainstreamers of oxide semiconductors commercialized in electronic device products due to their useful nature.\n\n❦ ❦\n\n## 1.2.3.2 Features And Uniqueness\n\nAs mentioned in Section 1.2.3.1, the choice of complicated quaternary compounds like IGZO—rather than simple binaries like ZnO, SnO2, and In2O3—is based on a working hypothesis for high-mobility amorphous oxides\n[11]. In these binary compounds, it is difficult to control oxygen deficiencies and to reduce intrinsic carrier density to suppress the off-current and instability of their TFTs. Furthermore, the choice of quaternary compound is based on insight into the coordination number of Ga in IGZO, where Ga3+ does not replace Zn2+ taking fivefold coordination to suppress excess carrier generation, while Ga3+ doped into ZnO replaces Zn2+ taking fourfold coordination to generate carriers. Thus, a-IGZO was selected as a model compound of candidates for channel materials of high-performance TFTs.\n\nAOS thin films and their TFTs like a-IGZO have the following features and uniqueness:\n1. Most AOS materials are n-type semiconductors.\n\n2. Carrier mobility increases with carrier density via a percolation transport mechanism, unlike conventional crystalline semiconductors with covalent bonding.\n\n3. Films are transparent to the light in a range of visible wavelengths due to wide band gaps (Eg ≳ 3 eV).\n\n4. It is possible to form the channel layers over noncrystalline substrates at low temperature by sputtering deposition, molecular–organic chemical vapor deposition, atomic layer deposition, and solution process coating.\n\n5. Various conventional gate-insulator materials are available with low densities of interfacial trap states, which warrant sufficiently high breakdown voltages for various applications.\n\n6. It is easy to form good ohmic contact to various source–drain electrodes.\n\n7. Uniformity in both short and long ranges is excellent because the films are free from crystalline grain boundaries.\n\n8. Operation mechanisms are relatively simple so that TFT models for device and circuit simulations are simple.\n\nSee Chapter 16 for some examples.\n\n9. The features in (4)–(8) enable us to adopt methods and facilities for device and circuit designs and manufacturing, which have been used for Si-based TFTs.\n\n10. A lower tail-state density beneath the conduction band minimum than a-Si:H TFTs by a few orders of magnitude makes large band vending possible to push up the Fermi level into the conduction band by field effect at low voltages of a forward gate bias. This leads to operations with band-like transport exhibiting over 10 times higher channel mobilities and low threshold voltages.\n\n11. A low-subgap deep-level density of states (DOS) above the midgap level enables fast switching with a small subthreshold swing (∼0.1 V⋅dec−1).\n\n12. A large occupied DOS below the midgap level and above the valence band maximum hinders band vending to pull down the Fermi level into the valence band under a backward gate bias. It also prohibits an inversion operation, which leads to very low off-current.\n\n13. The feature of (12) also suppresses a kink effect in the output characteristics of TFTs.\n\n14. Hot-carrier effect and short-channel effect are also small, and source-to-drain breakdown voltages are high. 15. Stability and reliability under electric or mechanical stresses are much better than those of a-Si:H TFTs and comparable to those of LTPS-TFTs.\n\n❦ ❦\nFurthermore, especially for a-IGZO: 16. TFT performance is good around metal cation compositions of crystalline single phases such as In:Ga:Zn:O=1:1:1:4 or 2:2:1:7, and it slowly changes with composition around these single phases.\n\n17. Large-area, stable, polycrystalline sputtering targets with single-phase crystalline compositions are available due to (16).\n\nThe features of (10) and (11) just meet the technical requirements for field-effect mobility (see Section 1.2.2.1).\n\nThe features of (10) and (12) satisfy the requirements for off-state leakage current and on/off current ratio (Section 1.2.2.2). The features of (13), (14), and (15) fulfill the conditions for stability and reliability (Section 1.2.2.3). The feature of (7) meets the needs for uniformity (Section 1.2.2.4). The features of (9) (i.e., (4)–(8)), (16), and (17)\nsatisfy the requirement for large-area devices by large-area mother-glass substrates (Section 1.2.2.5). The features of (4) and (15) fulfill the requirement for low-temperature fabrication and flexibility (Section 1.2.2.6). These are the reasons that AOS-TFTs have been actively researched, developed, and commercialized.\n\nWhile the features and uniqueness of AOS thin films and their TFTs give great advantages to their applications, there are still two major issues remaining to be solved. The first one is instability under light illumination, even in a range of visible wavelength with energy smaller than Eg despite transparency. The illumination of light shorter than half of Eg excites the deep occupied states below the midgap (featured in (11)) and generates electron–hole pairs to cause persistent photoconductivity and shift threshold voltage, VTH, to the negative direction. Furthermore, when the TFT is stressed by a negative gate bias simultaneously with an illumination stress, VTH largely shifts to the negative direction. This phenomenon is called instability under negative-bias-illumination stress\n(NBIS) and explained by the following mechanism: The positive charge carriers like holes are drifted toward the interface to the gate insulator through a band bending by the negative gate bias and finally trapped by the interfacial states, and as a result, the effective gate-bias voltage is shifted in the positive direction and VTH moves in the negative direction. The NBIS instability is a serious problem, especially for a switching TFT in a pixel circuit of an AM-LCD, which is biased by a large negative gate voltage for most of a frame time and always illuminated with the bright LCD backlight. The instability issues under illumination have been so far solved in commercial products by introducing some light-shielding structures into TFT device layers. Essential solutions to these problems have been proposed, such as adopting much wider Eg AOS materials [16], but they have not satisfied all of the other properties shown in the features of (1)–(17) that are required for AM-FPD applications.\n\nThe second one is a much higher FE than ∼10 cm2V−1s−1. As mentioned in Section 1.2.2.1, dimensions of peripheral circuits in AM-FPDs depend on the width of channels of implemented TFTs. Higher FE reduces the channel width and the width of the peripheral circuits to realize narrower borders of AM-FPDs. It is estimated that FE ≳30 cm2V−1s−1 is necessary to design the border width narrower than a few millimeters. Many challenges have been made, such as In-richer compositions in a-IGZO or amorphous In-Sn-Zn-O (ITZO), and some of them have started to be adopted in commercial products.\n\n## 1.2.3.3 Applications\n\nAfter their revival in the twenty-first century, active research of oxide semiconductor–based TFTs aiming at potential applications started with intense motivation due to their advantages, as described in Section 1.2.3.2. Figure 1.2.2 shows the emergence, evolution, and transition of application targets in the first decade, starting with the first demonstration of a-IGZO-TFTs in 2004.\n\nInitially, early challengers attempted to apply AOS-TFTs for AM-FPD backplane circuits of electric papers using electrophoretic display (EPD) devices on flexible polymer substrates, especially for low-temperature fabrication\n❦ ❦\n\n![47_image_0.png](47_image_0.png)\n\nprocesses. However, no commercial products have been launched because high-mobility TFTs are not always necessary for EPDs that are not able to show movies and full-color pictures due to their slow response and low contrast, and the market for electric papers has not grown.\n\nApplications to AM-OLED backplanes also started from the early days, taking advantage of high mobility, high stability, and high uniformity. As mentioned in Section 1.2.2, it is difficult to drive and fabricate large-sized AM-OLED panels by a-Si:H and LTPS-TFTs, respectively, and new, more competent TFTs have been long desired. AOS-TFTs only recently met the demands of large-sized AM-OLEDs, and commercial TV products appeared in 2015. Applications to advanced AM-LCDs with higher pixel resolutions, frame rate, and color depth followed those of AM-OLEDs, utilizing various advantages of AOS-TFTs, and the first commercial product was launched in 2012.\n\nThe current leading research is introduced in Chapters 15 and 18.\n\nThere were some challenges to apply AOS-TFTs to low-cost AM-LCDs fabricated at low temperatures on low-cost soda-lime glass substrates that cannot suffer high-temperature processes, instead of expensive and heat-resistant alkaline-free glass substrates. These challenges have failed to date, because it was found that post-annealing at\n≥300 ∘C was necessary to reduce defect densities of AOS thin films for TFT backplanes of AM-FPDs.\n\nLow-power-consumption AM-FPDs, which can reduce frame rates when displayed pictures are immobile, also have been proposed based on the extremely low off-leakage current of AOS-TFTs. The lower the frame rate is, the lower the power consumption in the peripheral circuits is. The low frame rate driving by AOS-TFTs has been commercialized in mobile devices such as smartphones and smartwatches.\n\nThere have been many challenges except applications to AM-FPDs. The high mobility and low-temperature fabrication of AOS-TFTs facilitate their applications to logic and radiofrequency circuits on flexible polymer substrates for wireless communications. The state-of-the art research is introduced in detail in Chapter 17. High breakdown voltage and low-temperature fabrication encourage engineers and scientists engaged in Si-based ultra-large-scale integration (ULSI) circuits to apply AOS-TFTs to the peripheral back-end-of-line circuits of ULSI. The leading research is described in Chapter 20. Volatile and nonvolatile memory devices comprise one of the most promising candidates for AOS-TFT applications, and they have been investigated utilizing low leakage current and low-temperature fabrications. The details are described in Chapters 19, 20, and 21. Neuromorphic applications based on AOS thin-film devices have also attracted attention, and they are described in Chapter 22.\n\nApplication of AOS-TFT-based active-matrix backplanes to X-ray image sensor arrays is described in Chapter 23. These post-AM-FPD applications are expected to be commercialized soon, taking advantage of accumulated technologies for materials, designs, and fabrications developed in AM-FPD applications.\n\n❦ ❦\n\n## 1.2.3.4 Development And Products Of Am-Fpds\n\nThrough active research on applications (mentioned in Section 1.2.3.3), many prototype AM-FPDs have been demonstrated using backplanes composed of oxide semiconductor TFTs. Three small panels initially appeared in the same year of 2006: (i) Ito *et al.* demonstrated a color EPD driven by transparent a-IGZO-TFTs formed over color filter arrays on a polymer substrate at room temperature [17], (ii) Hirao *et al.* demonstrated a transparent AM-LCD panel driven by ZnO-TFTs [18], and (iii) Park *et al.* demonstrated a transparent AM-OLED panel driven by ZnO-TFTs [19]. These pioneering works were then followed by worldwide activities in academies and industries to demonstrate more sophisticated prototype panels mainly using a-IGZO-TFTs with enhancement of panel size, resolution, color rendering, and flexibility.\n\nDuring this prototyping period, the remaining technical problems of stability, device structures, and mass production had been solved. Finally, in 2012, the first commercial product was launched into market in a small number of shipping tablet PC products (Apple iPad 3) with high-resolution (264 ppi) 9.7-inch-diagonal AM-LCDs for their screen panels driven by the a-IGZO-TFT-based backplane circuits. Since then, high-resolution AM-LCDs driven by a-IGZO-TFTs have been adopted by some smartphones, PC monitors, laptop PCs, and tablet PCs. In 2015, LG launched the first AM-OLED product, a 55-inch-diagonal full-high-definition (FHD; 2k) TV with a curved\n\n![49_image_0.png](49_image_0.png)\n\npanel driven by a-IGZO-TFTs. The AM-OLED TV products have evolved to a larger size (up to 88 inches diagonal)\nand a higher resolution (up to ultra-high-definition [UHD]; 8k), and they are more flexible with rollable screens through 2021 (Figure 1.2.3). Hybrid backplanes composed of both LTPS- and a-IGZO-TFTs (called \"LTPO-TFTs\")\nhave also been proposed to partially use AOS-TFTs for frame-rate reduction, and they have been adopted in AM-OLED panels of smartwatch products (since the Apple Watch Series 4 in 2018), where power-consumption savings are critical due to the watches' small batteries and the panels display motionless pictures very often. The LTPO-TFT-based AM-OLED panels also will soon be adopted by smartphones to boost the highest frame rate over 120 Hz and enhance user experiences in motion pictures, gaming, and artificial/virtual-reality content by suppressing response delays.\n\nIt is expected that AOS-TFTs will drive emerging and promising AM-FPDs such as halide perovskite LED\n(PeLED) and micro-LED (μLED) displays. Requirements for backplane TFTs from PeLED displays are almost the same as and rather simpler than AM-OLEDs. Current AOS-TFTs will readily meet the needs of high-performance PeLED displays when they are developed to acquire sufficient stability. On the other hand, μLED displays are composed of arrays of discrete GaN-based LEDs that have too steep a turn-on threshold to control by an analog driving scheme with continuous variation of injected current, and they have to be controlled by digital driving of pulse-width modulation (PWM). The PWM requires very abrupt changes in currents and very high mobilities for driving transistors. Therefore, much higher mobility AOS-TFTs than the current a-IGZO are required.\n\n❦ ❦\n\n## 1.2.4 Summary\n\nAfter incubation for over a half century, oxide semiconductor TFTs were commercialized by research and development of AOS-TFTs for only eight years from the emergence of a-IGZO-TFTs. Such relatively quick commercialization is due to not only the excellent properties of AOSs and their fortunate and timely fit with the technical requirements of applications, but also low barriers to entry into AOS-based technologies and commercialization, which are protected by fundamental intellectual properties licensed nonexclusively to everyone. AOSs have become one of the platform materials for semiconductor devices today.\n\nThere are still remaining issues in AOSs, as briefly mentioned, but it is expected that, after solving them, AOSs will become much more important in AM-FPD technologies and be used in other applications.\n\n## References\n\n1 Kamiya, T., Nomura, K., and Hosono, H.

The lack of periodicity and bond irregularities in the amorphous phases with strong directional bonding reduces the orbital overlap of the neighboring atoms and give rise to the formation of localized defect states near the band edges that may cause electron trapping, carrier scattering, and subgap absorption. In striking contrast to the covalent semiconductors, oxides of posttransition metals with ionic bonding are known to remain transparent in the visible range and exhibit not only crystalline-like electron mobility upon amorphization, but also 1–2 orders of magnitude higher carrier concentration in the disordered phases as compared to their crystalline counterparts [1–10].\n\nThe weak ionic bonding between posttransition metals and oxygen atoms makes the structural description of the amorphous oxide semiconductors (AOSs) challenging. In marked contrast to the Si- or Ge-based semiconductors or SiO2-based glasses (composed of the main-group metal oxides) that have strong covalent bonding responsible for distinct symmetry-defined nearest-neighbor polyhedra, the weak ionic metal–oxygen (M-O) bonds in AOSs allow for large bond length and angle deviations resulting in strong distortions in the M-O polyhedra and, therefore, in significant disorder within the short-range (nearest-neighbor) structure. These deviations must be carefully quantified in order to determine their role in the electronic properties of AOSs. For this, theoretical and experimental characterization that involves statistical averaging, although instructive in predicting some macroscopic properties such as optical band gap and electron effective mass using established solid-state theories, will miss important information hidden in the distribution and its tails. It might seem reasonable to assume that the structural outliers are key to understanding carrier generation and carrier scattering in AOSs; the larger the structural deviation from an average or a crystalline value, the more localized the defect should be. However, there is a second important consequence of the weak bonding in AOSs that must be taken into account in order to understand the resulting electronic properties: An undercoordinated atom or a strongly distorted polyhedron may trigger significant bond reconfiguration not only in the immediate vicinity, but also throughout the weakly bound disordered network via a ripple effect. As a result, the AOS's susceptibility to long-range structural rearrangement is beneficial for carrier transport: It may not only improve hybridization of different constituents (e.g., in a multi-cation oxide) in the conduction states, but also *reduce* the electron scattering via extensive structural reconfiguration near defects, dopants, or impurities [11–13]. The latter is not possible in crystalline oxides where the translational periodicity of the well-defined lattice limits structural relaxation around a defect to its nearest or next-nearest neighbors.\n\n❦ ❦\n† In loving memory of my father, Evgeny Medvedev, who gave me boundless support and encouragement.\n\nTherefore, structural outliers in AOSs should be considered along with their environment—a disordered, random structure—that requires a systematic description in order to gain insights into carrier generation and mobility in AOSs.\n\nTraditionally, the structural characterization of disordered oxides focuses on the M-O and M-M distributions; however, it is critical to understand how disorder affects the oxygen environment. Owing to the directional nature of the O--p-orbitals, the distortions in the O-M polyhedra are expected to have a more pronounced effect on the electronic properties of AOSs as compared to the symmetry-indifferent spherical s-orbitals of the posttransition metals\n[14]. Indeed, the differences in the orbital sensitivity to disorder are manifested in the characteristic asymmetry of the electronic localization of the tail states near the band edges in AOSs: The top of the valence band formed from the O--p-states exhibits strongly localized states, whereas the s-p-hybridized conduction states are generally delocalized in stoichiometric or nearly stoichiometric amorphous oxides and may feature shallow or weakly localized defects associated with metal undercoordination, even in highly sub-stoichiometric oxides [11]. The localized tail states near the top of the valence band arise from nonbonding O--p-orbitals for the oxygen atoms that are undercoordinated or in a highly distorted nearest-neighbor (metal) environment. These localized O--p-states were shown to contribute to the visible-range absorption in stoichiometric amorphous In2O3 [11] and play a key role in H defect formation and H mobility in amorphous In-Ga-O doped with hydrogen [12, 13]. While the most advanced X-ray scattering techniques for short-range structural characterization are not sensitive enough to probe the coordination environment of lightweight oxygen atoms, *ab initio* modeling combined with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) O1s or with oxygen nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements should provide valuable insights into oxygen coordination distribution and its role in the electrical and optical properties of AOSs.\n\nMany important aspects of AOSs have been addressed theoretically. The first molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of amorphous indium oxide appeared in 2009 [15], followed by models of electron transport in multi-cation AOSs [16–21], density functional theory (DFT) calculations of defect formation [22–29], and statistical descriptions of amorphous networks [30–32]. Despite the tremendous progress, the structural randomness that leads to an intricate interplay between bond distortions, coordination morphology, and electron (de)localization in AOSs is far from being understood.\n\nIn this work, computationally intensive *ab initio* MD simulations, comprehensive structural analysis, and hybrid density-functional calculations are employed to accurately describe the peculiarities in short- and medium-range structures of amorphous In2O3, SnO2, ZnO, and Ga2O3 and their role in the resulting electronic properties. In addition to carefully considering the statistical distributions of the nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor structural characteristics for both metal and oxygen atoms, we examine the individual M and O features and compare the results to the corresponding values in the crystalline oxides. To establish rigorous structure–property relationships, we calculate a so-called effective coordination number (ECN) for every atom based on a weighted average distance in the given polyhedron [33]. This approach provides a significant improvement of the structural description of the ionic AOSs as compared to the typical cutoff-based calculations that neglect bond distribution in individual polyhedra and hence may under- or overestimate the coordination for a large fraction of atoms. Similarly, we avoid the traditional electronic structure tools, such as atom-resolved density-of-states calculations that also rely on a fixed cutoff radius neglecting nonspherical charge density distribution near low-coordinated atoms or those in highly distorted environments. Instead, we employ Bader charge analysis that assigns charge values based on the carefully calculated gradients in the charge density distribution around each atom [34, 35]. Relating the structural peculiarities of each individual atom to its Bader charge contribution in the valence and conduction band helps us establish the microscopic origins of the electron (de)localization in the disordered oxide materials—and develop a framework for an accurate description of complex AOSs' behavior. In addition to the four binary oxides that are common constituents in the AOS phase space, we extend our analysis to multicomponent In-Ga-O (IGO) and In-Ga-Zn-O (IGZO) to highlight how metal composition affects the intricate structure–property relationships of AOSs with tunable properties.\n\n❦ ❦\n\n## 2.2 Brief Description Of Methods And Approaches 2.2.1 Computational Approach\n\nAll amorphous oxide structures were obtained using an *ab initio* MD liquid-quench approach, as implemented in the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP) [36, 37]. The calculations are based on DFT with periodic boundary conditions and employ Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange–correlation functionals\n[38] within the projector augmented-wave method [39, 40]. An initial stoichiometric oxide structure with specific density was melted at 3000 K to eliminate any crystalline memory and randomize the composition.\n\nThe melting step was followed by quench cycles with a specific cooling rate and an equilibration MD step at room temperature to stabilize the amorphous structure. Next, each atomic configuration was fully relaxed using DFT-PBE at 0 K. For optimization, the cutoff energy of 500 eV and the 4×4×4 Γ-centered k-point mesh were used; the atomic positions were relaxed until the Hellmann–Feynman force on each atom was below 0.01 eV/Å. The electronic and optical properties of amorphous In-based oxides were calculated using the hybrid Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06) approach [41] with a mixing parameter of 0.25 and a screening parameter μ of 0.2 Å−1.\n\nTo obtain adequate statistical distributions in the structural and, consequently, the electronic properties, 10–20 separate MD liquid-quench realizations with the same parameters and conditions (density, composition, stoichiometry, initial temperature, quench rate, equilibration, and relaxation) were obtained for each system. The density of an amorphous structure is an important factor and must be carefully determined. A set of independent MD liquid-quench simulations were performed for 4–5 different density values for each composition, resulting in over 300 MD realizations performed for this work. Upon room-temperature equilibration, the DFT total energy was calculated as an average over the final 500 MD steps to remove thermal fluctuations and plotted as a function of density for each oxide.\n\nTo validate the MD simulated structures, we calculate the extended X-ray absorption fine-structure (EXAFS)\nspectra for all amorphous models [42, 43] to directly compare the results with available experimental EXAFS\nmeasurements that capture the changes in the M-O bond lengths as well as in the second-shell M-M characteristics responsible for the medium-range structure at different densities.\n\nStructural randomness in amorphous oxides is then quantified by analyzing the characteristics of individual atoms. For this, the effective average distance (lav) for the M-O (O-M) first shell for each M-O (O-M) polyhedron was calculated using a weighted average, where each M-O (O-M) bond distance is compared to the shortest M-O\n(O-M) distance in each given polyhedron [34, 35]. Next, the ECN for individual M and O atoms was calculated as a sum of the first-shell distances weighted with respect to the effective average length obtained for each polyhedron.\n\nIn addition, we calculate the distortion of each M-O (O-M) polyhedron σ2, characterized by the standard deviation of the individual M-O bond lengths from the effective average M-O bond length for the given polyhedron. As mentioned in Section 2.1, this approach provides a significant improvement for the structural analysis of the ionic AOSs as compared to the typical approach that uses a single cutoff distance for all polyhedra, thus neglecting bond distribution in individual polyhedra, and hence may under- or overestimate the coordination of a large fraction of atoms in AOSs.\n\nIn addition, the total and partial vibrational density-of-states (VDOS) calculations were performed for the optimized structures to provide crucial information about local bonding and the dynamical stability of a model.\n\nThe vibrational inverse participation ratio (VIPR) was calculated from the normalized displacement vectors to determine the localization of different vibrational modes. Finally, optical absorption was derived from the frequency-dependent dielectric function calculated within independent particle approximation using the electronic transitions of the hybrid functional (HSE06) solution. The atomic structures and charge densities were plotted using VESTA software [44].\n\n❦ ❦\n\n## 2.2.2 Experimental Approach\n\nAmorphous binary oxide thin films were grown by pulsed-laser deposition (PLD) from dense hot-pressed indium oxide, zinc oxide, tin oxide, or gallium oxide targets (25 mm diameter). PLD was accomplished with a 248 nm KrF\nexcimer laser with 25 ns pulse duration and operated at 2 Hz. The 200 mJ/pulse beam was focused onto a 1 mm\n× 3 mm spot size. The target was rotated at 5 rpm about its axis to prevent localized heating. The target–substrate separation was fixed at 10 cm. Both the amorphous and crystalline films were grown at O2 ambient pressure of 7.5 mTorr. The silica substrates were attached to the substrate holder with silver paint and grown at a specific deposition temperature to ensure the films are amorphous. Films grown above 25 ∘C were attached to a resistively heated substrate holder; films grown below 25 ∘C were attached to a liquid nitrogen–cooled substrate holder. The amorphous In2O3, SnO2, and Ga2O3 films were grown at −25 ∘C. The amorphous ZnO film was grown at −100 ∘C.\n\nAll crystalline films were grown at +600 ∘C.\n\nX-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was performed at the 5-BMD (bending-moment diagram) beam line of DND-CAT (the DuPont–Northwestern–Dow Collaborative Access Team) at the Advanced Photon Source (APS)\nof Argonne National Laboratory (Argonne, IL). Metal k α fluorescence emissions from the metal-oxide thin films were measured using a four-element Si-drifted detector (SII) with the incident X-ray angle θ at about 45∘ with respect to the sample surface. The data were Fourier transformed with a Hanning window over multiple k ranges, where one-shell and three-shell fits were examined. The k ranges of the EXAFS data used in the analyses were k = 2.5 to 11.972 Å−1 (ZnO), 2.0 to 15.5 Å−1 (In2O3), 1.0 to 14.0 Å−1 (Ga2O3), and 2.3 to 15.8 Å−1 (SnO2), with a k-weight of 3.\n\n## 2.3 The Structure And Properties Of Crystalline And Amorphous In2O3 ❦ ❦\n\nFirst, the total pair-correlation functions for crystalline (bixbyite) and amorphous stoichiometric In2O3 with different densities are shown in Figure 2.1a. Both crystalline and amorphous results were obtained from the MD\nsimulations at 300 K (equilibration with 3,000 MD steps or 6 ps) to include possible temperature fluctuations. The results for amorphous structures represent an average over at least 10 separate MD realizations to provide better statistics. Structural disorder slightly shifts the first-shell peak toward longer In-O distances; in addition, the In-O distance distribution widens to include a small fraction of the In-O bonds with longer distances, between 2.3 Å and 2.6 Å (Figure 2.1a). This behavior is common to other semiconductors such as Si. More striking changes occur in the O-O and In-In distance distributions, with both the O-O peak at 2.8 Å and the In-In peak at 3.4 Å—as well as the longer range peaks—suppressed in the amorphous case. The disorder-induced changes in the O-O distribution set the ionic AOSs apart from the covalent silica-based glasses, where the O-O peak is preserved, signifying that the oxygen environment around the main-group metals (with well-defined O-O distances in the highly symmetric Si-O polyhedra) is maintained upon amorphization. Because the strength of the M-O bonding determines the rigidity of the local polyhedral structure, indium oxide, having the weakest bonding among the posttransition metal oxides considered in this work, features the largest average distortions in the first-shell M-O\npolyhedra (Table 2.1). Therefore, despite seemingly unchanged first-shell In-O distribution upon amorphization, the short-range (nearest-neighbor) disorder should be expected from the distortions associated with the loss of symmetry and significant bond deviations within individual In-O polyhedra. In the medium range, at ∼3.2 Å and above (Figure 2.1a), the broader In-In distance distribution suggests that sharing of the neighboring In-O polyhedra changes significantly upon amorphization, as indeed can be seen from the structural comparison given in Figure 2.1c and 2.1d. The changes in In-O polyhedra sharing will be quantified in Section 2.7.\n\nTo determine the optimal density of amorphous In2O3, at least 10 independent MD liquid-quench simulations were performed for five different density values. Upon equilibration of each configuration at 300 K for 6 ps, the DFT total energy was calculated as an average over the final (stable) 500 MD steps to remove thermal fluctuations.\n\n![56_image_0.png](56_image_0.png)\n\n38 *2 Electronic Structure and Structural Randomness*\n\nDensity, g/cm3 ECN lav,Å 2, ×104 Å2 ECN lav, Å 2, ×104 Å2\n\nc-In2O3 7.20 5.84\n\n5.73\n\n2.17\n\n2.17\n\n33 57\n\n3.84 2.17 50\n\na-In2O3 7.30 5.38 2.19 124 3.65 2.20 126\n\n7.20 5.38 2.20 121 3.64 2.20 126 7.10 5.35 2.20 127 3.62 2.20 132 7.00* 5.32 2.21 132 3.60 2.21 135 6.90 5.14 2.18 141 3.50 2.19 136\n\nc-SnO2 **6.95 5.90 2.05 19 2.95 2.05 19** a-SnO2 6.81 5.50 2.09 119 2.80 2.09 97\n\n6.48* 5.41 2.09 117 2.76 2.09 98 6.17 5.26 2.09 116 2.70 2.09 91 5.88 5.14 2.09 118 2.72 2.10 91\n\nc**-ZnO 5.61 3.91 1.98 25 3.91 1.98 24** a-ZnO 5.78 3.80 2.00 104 3.80 2.00 106\n\n5.50 3.70 2.00 99 3.70 2.00 96\n\n5.23* 3.64 2.00 96 3.65 2.00 106\n\n4.98 3.53 1.99 102 3.50 2.00 108\n\nc-Ga2O3 6.44 3.93\n\n5.59\n\n1.84\n\n1.98\n\n16\n\n75\n\n3.46\n\n2.89 2.83\n\n❦ ❦\n\n139\n\n38 55\n\na-Ga2O3 6.12 4.67 1.93 123 3.19 1.94 115\n\n5.80 4.50 1.92 115 3.10 1.94 110 5.50 4.34 1.92 97 2.94 1.92 96 5.23* 4.26 1.92 87 2.85 1.92 90 4.97 4.16 1.91 79 2.77 1.91 87\n\nMetal–Oxygen Oxygen–Metal\n\nNote: The values represent an average over all metal or oxygen atoms in the supercell and over 10 separate MD realizations at the given density. Bixbyite, rutile, wurtzite, and monoclinic β-phase structures are considered for crystalline In2O3, SnO2, ZnO, and Ga2O3, respectively. The results, shown in Figure 2.1b, suggest that (i) the formation energy of different MD realizations varies within at least 0.02 eV/atom, and the variation is largest for the lowest density case, most likely due to differences in morphology; (ii) several MD realizations (or bigger cells) are required to predict the optimal density; and (iii) there is a substantial overlap between the total energy for the configurations with different densities, giving an extremely shallow minimum in the energy–density plot. The latter signifies that amorphous indium oxide samples with density values within a wide range (7.00–7.30 g/cm3) could be grown. Different deposition techniques and pre- or postdeposition conditions are likely to affect the density of amorphous In2O3 oxide. Moreover, we speculate that the density of amorphous In2O3 may change long after the sample was deposited, making the structural characterization challenging. In the discussion here, amorphous indium oxide structures with a density of 7.00 g/cm3 are used; this optimal density is slightly lower than the crystalline density of 7.19 g/cm3.\n\n| 3.84           | 2.17      | 50   |\n|----------------|-----------|------|\n| 3.46 2.89 2.83 | 139 38 55 |      |\n| 1.96 1.87 1.90 |           |      |\n\n❦\n2.3 The Structure and Properties of Crystalline and Amorphous In2O3 39 To validate the theoretical amorphous models, the EXAFS is calculated for the In K edge for amorphous In2O3 models with different densities. From experimental EXAFS (Figure 2.1e), the peak that corresponds to the indium first shell (In-O) is maintained, whereas the second-shell (In-In) peak is significantly suppressed upon amorphization, in accordance with our pair-correlation function results (Figure 2.1a). Overall, an excellent agreement between the theoretical and experimental EXAFS is obtained (Figure 2.1f). Moreover, the results further corroborate the crucial effect that density has on the In-In distances and coordination (Figure 2.1f).\n\nNext, total and partial VDOSs were calculated for crystalline and the most stable amorphous In2O3 structures to verify the dynamical stability of the latter structure and to identify disorder-induced changes. In addition, the VIPR was calculated from the normalized displacement vectors to determine the localization of different vibrational modes. The results, shown in Figure 2.1e and 2.1f, demonstrate that disorder not only makes the VDOS\nfeatureless by smearing and suppressing the well-defined peaks within the entire range of frequencies, but also leads to a notable overlap between the In and O VDOSs. The overlap occurs primarily due to a shift of the oxygen VDOS toward the lower frequencies. Similarly, the In VDOS develops low-frequency modes that do not exist in bixbyite In2O3. The VDOS shifts toward lower frequencies for both oxygen and indium are characteristic of amorphous phases. At the same time, several oxygen atoms that oscillate at normal modes with high frequencies of around 550–650 cm−1 (with the largest VIPR value of 0.6) and several In atoms that oscillate with low frequencies of 50 cm−1 (the largest VIPR value of 0.1) appear in the amorphous phase, whereas the remaining frequencies show low VIPR values, comparable to those in the crystalline mode and suggesting an evenly distributed vibration among different atoms within most of the spectrum.\n\nOur comprehensive structural analysis begins with a comparison of the ECN distributions for the first-shell In-O and O-In polyhedra for the crystalline and amorphous indium oxide with perfect stoichiometry (i.e., for the oxygen-defect-free structures; Figure 2.2a). To account for room-temperature atomic fluctuations, the ECN is calculated for each individual In and O atom as a time average obtained from MD simulations at 300 K for 3,000 steps (6 ps). For amorphous phases, we analyzed 10 independent MD realizations at the optimal density; Figure 2.2 combines the results for the 10 realizations.\n\nIn bixbyite In2O3, there are two non-equivalent In sites, 8b and 24d; the former represents a perfect octahedron with six oxygen neighbors located at a distance of 2.17 Å and an ECN of 6.00, whereas the latter is a distorted octahedra with two O neighbors at 2.13 Å, two at 2.20 Å, and two at 2.23 Å, making the average In-O distance to be 2.18 Å and ECN = 5.91 for the 24d site. At room temperature, the atomic vibrations reduce the ECN of the two In types to 5.84 and 5.73, respectively, and the effective average In-O distance is slightly reduced to 2.17 Å\nfor the 24d site (Table 2.1). Importantly, the temperature effects make the two types of In atoms indistinguishable, representing both with a single-peaked broad distribution of ECN (Figure 2.2a). Oxygen atoms in crystalline In2O3 are four-coordinated with In neighbors. At room temperature, the average effective coordination of oxygen atoms is 3.84.\n\nECN distributions for crystalline and amorphous In2O3 are shown in Figure 2.2a. Clearly, both indium and oxygen distributions become nearly two times wider upon amorphization. The number of \"fully\" coordinated In and O atoms is suppressed; moreover, secondary peaks at ECN(In) = 5 and ECN(O) = 3 become visible. Thus, despite the similarities in the nearest-neighbor indium–oxygen distance distributions in the crystalline and amorphous phases (Figure 2.1a), disorder leads to significant bond deviations in individual polyhedra, reducing the coordination numbers for a large fraction of In-O and O-In. The average ECN values for different densities are given in Table 2.1.\n\nAs can be expected, the angle distributions for both O-In-O and In-O-In also widen and become more uniform in the amorphous In2O3 (Figure 2.2b). As mentioned in Section 2.1, the distortions in the O-In polyhedra are expected to have a more pronounced effect on the electronic properties of AOSs due to the directional nature of the O--p-orbitals as compared to the symmetry-indifferent spherical In-s-orbitals [14]. It should be noted here that the In-O-In angle also can be viewed as a measure of the mutual alignment of neighboring InO polyhedra.\n\nIn bixbyite In2O3, the peak at about In-O-In = 128∘ corresponds to the corner-shared InO6 polyhedra; this peak\n❦ ❦\n\n![59_image_0.png](59_image_0.png)\n\nis strongly suppressed in the amorphous phase, suggesting a significant disorder in the medium-range structure even though the density of the amorphous structure is only 3% lower than that in the crystalline oxide.\n\nThe remarkable difference between crystalline and amorphous In2O3 can be best visualized when the time-averaged ECN values for the individual In and O atoms are plotted as a function of their time-averaged effective distance and distortion (Figure 2.2c). Strikingly, despite the similarity of the In-O distance distributions for crystalline and amorphous oxides (Figure 2.1a), only four In atoms out of 540 within the 10 MD realizations have structural values that are similar to those in bixbyite In2O3 (i.e., 5.70 < ECN < 6.00 and σ2 < 0.0060),\nalthough all four have the effective average In-O distance of 2.20 Å, which is above the corresponding average crystalline distance of 2.17 Å. Importantly, the amorphous oxide features a notable fraction of In atoms that are undercoordinated (ECN < 5.0) and have low distortions (σ2 < 0.01 Å2) as well as those that are overcoordinated\n(ECN > 6.0) (Figure 2.2c). Similar observations can be done for oxygen atoms. For the majority of atoms, however, there are two clear correlations: (i) the lower the ECN value, the larger the distortions in the polyhedral are; and (ii) the reduction in ECN value is generally associated with shorter average bond length, as should be expected for an ionic material. While the spherical symmetry of the In s-states makes the In atoms indifferent to the exact direction in which the oxygen neighbors are located (the distribution of the O-In-O angles is wide and uniform; Figure 2.1b), the overlap between the spherical s-orbital of In and the p-orbitals of O atoms may be affected by changes in the In-O distances. This situation will be discussed in the electronic localization section of this chapter\n(Section 2.7).\n\nThus, disorder leads to significant bond deviations and reduced effective coordination numbers for individual In and O atoms, even though the density of amorphous oxide is lower by less than 3% as compared to that in the\n❦\n2.3 The Structure and Properties of Crystalline and Amorphous In2O3 41 bixbyite In2O3 and the amorphous structures are perfectly stoichiometric. This result highlights the importance of investigating ECN and distortion of individual atoms compared to merely examining bond distance averages: Distance distributions do not capture the degree or prevalence of the M-O polyhedra distortions that ultimately determine the metal coordination and quantify structure randomness.\n\nThe analyzed structural values averaged over 10 MD realizations, and over 54 In or 81 O atoms in each realization for the amorphous In2O3 at each density are compared to those for the crystalline oxide in Table 2.1. As expected, the effective coordination of In and O decreases for lower density, whereas the distortions increase. In agreement with the pair-correlation function shown in Figure 2.1a, the averaged first-shell distances are nearly insensitive to the density changes.\n\nNow, the effect of the broad distributions in the main structural characteristics of In and O atoms in amorphous In2O3 on the electronic properties should be determined. For this, charge density distributions in the highest valence band and the lowest conduction band are calculated for the fully relaxed structures using an accurate hybrid functional approach. Figure 2.3a–2.3d compares the results for the crystalline and amorphous oxide. The uniform charge density distributions observed for both the valence and conduction bands of bixbyite In2O3 are not maintained upon amorphization. However, the changes in charge density distribution in the valence and conduction bands are markedly different. The conduction band (Figure 2.3a and 2.3b) features various amounts of charge accumulation around different In atoms, with a small fraction having a negligible charge density in their vicinity. Although the conduction charge distribution in amorphous In2O3 is clearly not as uniform as it is in the crystalline oxide, a large enough fraction of the In atoms contribute to the conduction states to create conductivity paths with significant overlap between the neighboring atoms' nonspherical density, resulting in interstitial or interatomic bridgelike charge distributions. In contrast, only a few oxygen atoms contribute to the top of the valence band, suggesting a strong electron localization (Figure 2.3c and 2.3d). As mentioned in Section 2.1, this characteristic asymmetry of the electronic localization of the states near the band edges in AOSs stems from the different sensitivity of the directional O--p-orbitals and spherically symmetric In--s-orbitals to disorder.\n\nTo relate the specific structural characteristics of individual O or In atoms with their valence or conduction charge, we performed Bader charge analysis and plotted the individual ECN, effective distance (lav), and distortion (σ2) as a function of Bader charge calculated for the given atom. As expected from the charge distribution plot (Figure 2.3d), the strong electron localization (with Bader contributions as large as 40% of the total charge in the cell; Figure 2.3e) is found for several O atoms. For the In atoms, the largest Bader charge contribution to the conduction band is significantly smaller: only 6% of the total charge in the cell. Overall, the much broader valence Bader charge distribution for the oxygen atoms is asymmetric and shifted toward a lower Bader charge from the expected uniform charge distribution value (shown as a vertical line in Figure 2.3e). This suggests that most of the oxygen atoms give negligible contributions at the top of the valence band. In contrast, the conduction Bader charge distribution is two times narrower for the In atoms and is centered at the expected uniform charge value\n(Figure 2.3f). Therefore, the majority of the In atoms contribute to the conduction states at a similar level as if the charge is evenly distributed throughout the cell. Most strikingly, no clear correlation is found between the Bader charge and the coordination, distances, or distortion of O or In atoms (Figure 2.3e and 2.3f, respectively). In other words, both fully coordinated and undercoordinated atoms, those with shorter or longer effective distances than the overall average, and those with equivalent or highly uneven bonds in the polyhedra all have a similar probability for a large or a negligible Bader contribution. Therefore, distribution outliers do not necessarily represent electronic \"defects\" and do not necessarily contribute to the electronic tail states in amorphous In2O3. This result implies that the above structural parameters alone do not serve as a predictor for electron (de)localization. As will be shown in this chapter, two or all three of the introduced structural parameters (ECN, lav, and σ2) should be used in combination and also be compared to the structural features of the surrounding atoms in order to predict the electronic properties.\n\n❦ ❦\n\n![61_image_0.png](61_image_0.png)\n\n## 2.4 The Structure And Properties Of Crystalline And Amorphous Sno2\n\n❦\n2.4 The Structure and Properties of Crystalline and Amorphous SnO2 43 The total pair-correlation functions for crystalline (rutile) and amorphous stoichiometric SnO2 with different densities are shown in Figure 2.4a. Similar to the In2O3 case (Figure 2.1), the nearest-neighbor Sn-O distances are maintained upon amorphization: Structural disorder slightly shifts the first-shell peak toward longer Sn-O\ndistances and widens the Sn-O distance distribution to include a small fraction of the Sn-O bonds with longer distances (Figure 2.4a). Also, the O-O distribution (peaks at 2.6 Å, 2.9 Å, and 3.2 Å in crystalline SnO2) and the Sn-Sn distribution (peaks at 3.2 Å and 3.7 Å)—as well as the longer range peaks—are nearly completely suppressed in the amorphous case, especially in low-density cases. Hence, similar to the In2O3 case, amorphous SnO2 exhibits strong short-range (nearest-neighbor) disorder and significant changes in the medium-range structure (greater than ∼3.2 Å). Strong disorder in the SnO polyhedra sharing can be seen from the structural comparison given in Figure 2.4c and 2.4d.\n\nThe optimal density of amorphous SnO2 was determined based on the energy–volume curve with at least 10 independent MD liquid-quench simulations performed for each density value (Figure 2.4b). The results suggest that (i) the formation energy of different MD realizations varies within 0.03–0.04 eV/atom, most likely due to differences in morphology; (ii) several MD realizations (or bigger cells) are required to predict the optimal density; and (iii) there is a substantial overlap between the total energy for the configurations with different densities, giving a shallow minimum in the energy–density plot. The latter signifies that amorphous tin oxide samples with density values within the considered range (5.9–6.8 g/cm3) could be grown. In the discussion here, the amorphous tin oxide structures with a density of 6.48 g/cm3 are used; this optimal density is slightly lower than the crystalline density of 6.95 g/cm3.\n\nSimilar to In2O3, disorder strongly suppresses the Sn second-shell (Sn-Sn) peak, whereas the tin first-shell\n(Sn-O) peak is less affected, as can be seen from experimental EXAFS (Figure 2.4e). This agrees well with our pair-correlation function results (Figure 2.4a). An excellent agreement between theoretical and experimental EXAFS is obtained for the Sn K edge for amorphous SnO2 (Figure 2.4f), validating the theoretical MD models. In marked contrast to In2O3, density in amorphous SnO2 has a small effect on the Sn-Sn distances and coordination\n(cf. Figure 2.1f and 2.4f). At the same time, the Sn-O coordination appears to be more sensitive to the amorphous oxide density as compared to that of In-O (Table 2.1).\n\nNext, the total and partial VDOS and the VIPR were calculated for crystalline and the most stable amorphous SnO2 structures (Figures 2.4e and 2.4f). In rutile SnO2, the oxygen VDOS is split into low- and high-frequency bands with a pronounced gap between them. The former corresponds to a combination of Sn and O modes with comparable VDOS except for the lowest frequency range, governed by Sn atoms (Figure 2.4e). Similar to In2O3, disorder makes the VDOS featureless and shifts both the oxygen and tin VDOS toward the lower frequencies. High-frequency modes (around 650–850 cm−1) associated with oscillations of a few oxygen atoms, with the largest VIPR value of around 0.4, as well as low-frequency modes (50 cm−1) of a few In atoms with the largest VIPR value of less than 0.1 appear in the amorphous phase. However, in the intermediate-frequency range, the VIPR values are comparable to or even lower than those in the crystalline case, suggesting an evenly distributed vibration among different atoms within most of the spectrum.\n\nA comparison of the ECN distributions for the first-shell Sn-O and O-Sn polyhedra for the crystalline and amorphous tin oxide with perfect stoichiometry (i.e., the oxygen-defect-free structures) is given in Figure 2.5a. In rutile SnO2, there is only one equivalent type of Sn and O sites. Tin atoms have six nearly equidistant Sn-O bonds with a bond length of 2.05 Å, so that even at room temperature, when the atomic fluctuations are included, the symmetry of the Sn-O polyhedral remains close to an octahedron and the average effective coordination of Sn atoms is 5.90, which is higher than that in bixbyite In2O3, 5.84 and 5.73 (Table 2.1). Indeed, the polyhedral distortions are smaller in crystalline SnO2, σ2 = 0.0019 Å2, as compared to 0.0033 Å2 and 0.0057 Å2 for two non-equivalent types of In atoms in crystalline In2O3. This may originate from a higher structural symmetry of SnO2 and/or stronger Sn-O\nbonds as compared to the In-O bonds. All oxygen atoms are three-coordinated with Sn atoms, with an average room-temperature effective coordination of 2.95.\n\n❦ ❦\n\n![63_image_0.png](63_image_0.png)\n\n❦\n2.4 The Structure and Properties of Crystalline and Amorphous SnO2 45\n\n![64_image_0.png](64_image_0.png)\n\nInterestingly, the average ECN(Sn) values remain to be higher in amorphous SnO2 than those in amorphous In2O3, although they become similar at lower densities (Table 2.1). Accordingly, the polyhedral distortion remains lower in amorphous SnO2 than in amorphous In2O3 (Table 2.1). Given the lack of ordering in the amorphous phases, the difference stems solely from the weaker In-O bonds as compared to the Sn-O bond strength. The calculated ECN distributions for crystalline and amorphous SnO2 are shown in Figure 2.5a. Similar to the In2O3 case, both tin and oxygen distributions become nearly two times wider upon amorphization. The number of \"fully\" coordinated Sn atoms is strongly suppressed, although for the O atoms the peak at ECN(O) = 3 value is high. At the same time, secondary peaks at ECN(Sn) = 5 and ECN(O) = 2 become visible. Thus, despite the similarities in the nearest-neighbor tin–oxygen distance distributions in the crystalline and amorphous phases (Figure 2.3a),\ndisorder leads to significant bond deviations in individual polyhedra, reducing the coordination numbers for a large fraction of Sn-O and a smaller fraction of O-Sn. Both Sn and O coordination distributions feature a scarce but persistent number of highly coordinated atoms, above 6 and above 3, respectively. Such coordination values were not part of the crystalline phase.\n\nThe angle distributions for both O-Sn-O and Sn-O-Sn widen and become more uniform in the amorphous SnO2, although the double-peak structure persists for Sn-O-Sn (Figure 2.5b), as expected from the directional nature of the O--p-orbitals. The Sn-O-Sn angle represents mutual alignment of neighboring SnO polyhedra. In rutile SnO2, the majority (80%) of all Sn-Sn neighbors are corner-shared, which corresponds to Sn-O-Sn = 130∘. Upon amorphization, the number of corner-shared Sn-Sn pairs decreases to 70%, but the associated Sn-Sn corner-shared distance distribution widens—in accord with the Sn-O-Sn peak at 130∘. Yet, the double-peak structure for the Sn-O-Sn angle distribution suggests that the medium-range structure in amorphous SnO2 is slightly less disordered than it is in amorphous In2O3, where the In-O-In angle distribution is single-peaked and long-tailed and the In-In corner-shared distance distribution is significantly broader, as will be shown in Section 2.7.\n\nDisorder leads to significant bond deviations and reduced effective coordination numbers for individual Sn and O atoms, even though the amorphous structures are perfectly stoichiometric. The time-averaged ECN values for the individual In and O atoms, plotted as a function of their time-averaged effective distance and distortion for both crystalline and amorphous SnO2, are shown in Figure 2.5c. Similar to the In2O3 case, only a few Sn and O\natoms in the amorphous SnO2 resemble the characteristics of those in the crystalline phase. Also, the amorphous oxide features a considerable fraction of O atoms that are overcoordinated (ECN > 3.0) and have notably longer effective O-Sn distances. Despite the outliers, the majority of oxygen atoms favor being three-coordinated with tin, even though their effective Sn-O distances vary within a wide range, from 2.02 Å to 2.15 Å. Independent of O\ncoordination, a reduction in ECN(O) is associated with stronger distortion. The majority of tin atoms, similar to the In atoms, follow the expected trend: The lower the ECN value, the shorter the effective average bond length. The analyzed structural values, averaged over 10 MD realizations and over 46 In or 92 O atoms in each realization for the amorphous SnO2 at each density, are compared to those for the crystalline oxide and to In2O3 cases in Table 2.1.\n\nAs expected, the effective coordination of Sn and O decreases for lower density, although the O coordination seems to saturate at the lowest density. At the same time, the Sn-O polyhedral distortions remain nearly unchanged with density—in contrast to In2O3, where the In-O distortions increase when the density decreases. In agreement with the pair-correlation function shown in Figure 2.3a, the averaged first-shell distances are insensitive to the density changes.\n\nNext, the effect of the broad distributions in the main structural characteristics of Sn and O atoms in amorphous SnO2 on the electronic properties is determined. Figure 2.6a–2.6d compares the charge density distributions in the highest valence band and the lowest conduction band in the fully relaxed crystalline and amorphous structures. The disorder-induced changes are similar to those in In2O3 (cf. Figure 2.3a–2.3d): The conduction band charge is not uniform, yet a large enough fraction of the Sn atoms contribute to the conduction states to create conductivity channels with neighbor contributions that are alike in the charge value (Figure 2.6b). A small fraction of Sn atoms have a negligible charge density in their vicinity, and conversely, only a few oxygen atoms contribute to the top of the valence band (Figure 2.6c and 2.6d). The calculated Bader charge contributions from the O atoms to the highest valence band reveal even stronger asymmetry in the distribution as compared to the amorphous In2O3 (cf. Figure 2.3e and 2.6e): A significant number of oxygen atoms have zero or negligible contributions, while the Bader charge on several oxygen atoms is as large as 80% of the total charge in the cell. Therefore, the oxygen Bader charge distribution is wider in amorphous SnO2 than in amorphous In2O3, and the electron localization on some nonbonding O--p-states is stronger. Similar to In2O3, however, we do not find a correlation between the ECN, effective distance (lav), or distortion (σ2) of oxygen atoms and the corresponding valence Bader charge contribution. For the Sn atoms, the Bader charge is slightly wider and slightly asymmetric with respect to the expected uniform charge value than that of In (cf. Figures 2.3f and 2.6f); yet the majority of Sn atoms contribute to the conduction states at a similar level, as if the charge is evenly distributed throughout the cell.\n\n❦ ❦\n\n## 2.5 The Structure And Properties Of Crystalline And Amorphous Zno\n\nThe total pair-correlation function for crystalline (wurtzite) and amorphous stoichiometric ZnO with different densities is shown in Figure 2.7a. Similar to the In2O3 and SnO2 cases (Figures 2.1 and 2.4), the nearest-neighbor Zn-O distances are maintained upon amorphization: Structural disorder only slightly shifts the first-shell peak toward longer Zn-O distances and widens the Zn-O distance distribution to include a fraction of the Zn-O bonds with longer distances (Figure 2.7a). In wurtzite ZnO, the O-O distribution and the Zn-Zn distribution coincide, resulting in a wide peak at 3.23 Å. Upon amorphization, the peak is significantly but not completely suppressed.\n\n![66_image_0.png](66_image_0.png)\n\n![67_image_0.png](67_image_0.png)\n\n❦\n2.5 The Structure and Properties of Crystalline and Amorphous ZnO 49 Hence, similar to the In2O3 and SnO2 cases, amorphous ZnO is expected to feature short-range (nearest-neighbor)\ndisorder and significant changes in the medium range. Strong disorder in the ZnO polyhedra sharing can be seen in Figure 2.7c and 2.7d.\n\nThe optimal density of amorphous ZnO was determined based on the energy–volume curve with at least 10 independent MD liquid-quench simulations performed for each density value (Figure 2.7b). The formation energy of different MD realizations varies within 0.04 eV/atom, and there is a substantial overlap between the total energy for the configurations with different densities, giving a shallow minimum in the energy–density plot. It must be noted that at high density values, several realizations resulted in nearly crystalline, well-ordered phases, suggesting that the amorphous zinc oxide could be challenging to grow (i.e., may require fast quench rates, very low deposition temperatures, or an additional constituent in order to stabilize the amorphous phase). In the discussion here, amorphous zinc oxide structures with a density of 5.23 g/cm3 are used; this optimal density is slightly lower than the crystalline density of 5.61 g/cm3.\n\nSimilar to In2O3 and SnO2, disorder strongly suppresses the Zn second-shell (Zn-Zn) peak, whereas the zinc first-shell (Zn-O) peak is less affected, as can be seen from experimental EXAFS (Figure 2.7e). This agrees well with our pair-correlation function results (Figure 2.7a). An excellent agreement between theoretical and experimental EXAFS is obtained for the Zn K edge for the first shell in amorphous ZnO (Figure 2.7f). The second-shell Zn-Zn peak is completely suppressed in all theoretical models, showing no dependence on the oxide density. The pronounced Zn-Zn peak in experimental EXAFS may signify that the amorphous ZnO sample has a considerable fraction of crystalline nano-inclusions.\n\nThe total and partial VDOS and the VIPR, calculated for crystalline and the most stable amorphous ZnO structures, are shown in Figure 2.7e and 2.7f. Similar to rutile SnO2, the VDOS is split into low- and high-frequency bands with a pronounced gap between them; however, there are only small contributions of the opposite atom type in each band. Disorder makes the VDOS featureless and shifts oxygen but not zinc VDOSs toward the lower frequencies, with a pronounced VDOS(O) tail stretching into the low-frequency Zn vibrational states. High-frequency modes (around 550–650 cm−1) associated with oscillations of a few oxygen atoms, with the largest VIPR value of less than 0.2 and a single low-frequency mode (50 cm−1) for zinc with a similar VIPR value, appear in the amorphous phase. With the exception of the outer band edges and also the band overlap region (around 340 cm−1),\nthe VIPR values are comparable to or even lower than those in the crystalline ZnO case, suggesting an evenly distributed vibration among different atoms within most of the spectrum.\n\nA comparison of ECN distributions for the first-shell Zn-O and O-Zn polyhedra for crystalline and amorphous zinc oxide with perfect stoichiometry (i.e., for the oxygen-defect-free structures) is given in Figure 2.8a. In wurtzite ZnO, Zn and O sites are equivalent by symmetry. Zinc and oxygen atoms have four nearly equidistant Zn-O bonds with a bond length of 1.98 Å. At room temperature, when the atomic fluctuations are included, the symmetry of the Zn-O polyhedral remains close to that of a tetrahedron, and the average effective coordination of both Zn and O\natoms is 3.91 (Table 2.1). Upon amorphization, both zinc and oxygen distributions become two times wider, similar to In2O3 and SnO2 cases. Despite the lack of structural order, zinc and oxygen ECN distributions are nearly indistinguishable, with the number of four-coordinated atoms suppressed and a secondary peak at ECN = 3 appearing. Thus, similar to In2O3 and SnO2 cases, the seemingly insignificant broadening of the first-shell distance distribution toward longer nearest-neighbor distances in amorphous ZnO leads to significant bond deviations in individual polyhedra, reducing the coordination numbers for a large fraction of Zn and O atoms. We note here that the average Zn and O effective coordination numbers decrease with decreasing density and begin to deviate from each other slightly at the lowest density value considered (Table 2.1). Compared to both amorphous In2O3 and SnO2, the polyhedral distortions in amorphous ZnO are smaller, as expected from stronger Zn-O bonds as compared to the In-O and Sn-O bonds.\n\nThe angle distributions for both O-Zn-O and Zn-O-Zn widen but become less uniform in the amorphous ZnO,\ndue to the presence of a shoulder at the 90o angle—as compared to wurtzite ZnO (Figure 2.8b). However, the 110∘ angle, characteristic for hexagonal lattice, prevails. In wurtzite ZnO, all Zn-Zn neighbors are corner-shared; upon amorphization, the number of corner-shared Zn-Zn pairs slightly decreases to 90% due to the appearance of edge-shared polyhedra, as will be discussed in Section 2.7.\n\n❦ ❦\n\n![69_image_0.png](69_image_0.png)\n\nSimilar to In2O3 and SnO2 cases, disorder leads to significant bond distortions and reduced effective coordination numbers for individual Zn and O atoms, even though the amorphous ZnO structures are perfectly stoichiometric.\n\nThe time-averaged ECN values for the individual Zn and O atoms, plotted as a function of their time-averaged effective distance and distortion for both crystalline and amorphous ZnO, are shown in Figure 2.8c. Despite the nearly identical ECN distributions for Zn and O (Figure 2.8a), the individual structural plots (Figure 2.8c) reveal several important differences between them: There is a smaller number of overcoordinated (ECN > 4) O than that of Zn, and two-coordinated oxygen atoms were found. The former result can be again explained based on the orbital differences: The directional O--p-orbitals favor fourfold or threefold symmetry, whereas the spherical s-orbitals may add a fifth neighbor and maintain the charge balance by increasing the distances to the remaining O\nneighbors. The same trend is maintained for the undercoordinated Zn atoms that generally have shorter effective bond lengths (Figure 2.8c).\n\nFigure 2.9a–2.9d compares the charge density distributions in the highest valence band and the lowest conduction band in the fully relaxed crystalline and amorphous ZnO structures. The disorder-induced changes are similar to those in In2O3 and SnO2 (cf. Figures 2.3a–2.3d and 2.6a–2.6d): The conduction band charge is not uniform, yet a significant fraction of the Zn atoms contribute to the conduction states to create a conductivity path through the supercell. A fraction of Zn atoms have a negligible charge in their vicinity, and conversely, only a few oxygen atoms contribute to the top of the valence band (Figure 2.9c and 2.9d). The calculated Bader charge contributions from the O atoms to the highest valence band reveal strong asymmetry in the distribution: A significant number of oxygen atoms have negligible contributions, while several oxygen atoms have a Bader charge as large as 50%\nof the total charge in the cell, which is a weaker localization than that in SnO2 and comparable to that in In2O3.\n\n![70_image_0.png](70_image_0.png)\n\nSimilar to indium and tin oxides, we do not find a correlation between the ECN, effective distance (lav), or distortion (σ2) of oxygen atoms and the corresponding valence Bader charge contribution. For the Zn atoms, the Bader charge is slightly wider and more asymmetric with respect to the expected uniform charge value than that of In\n(cf. Figures 2.3f and 2.9f); yet the majority of Zn atoms contribute to the conduction states at a similar level as if the charge is evenly distributed throughout the cell. Therefore, although only a few Zn and O atoms in the amorphous ZnO resemble the same characteristics as those in the crystalline phase, the s-p hybridization is maintained and the conduction band remains delocalized.\n\n## 2.6 The Structure And Properties Of Crystalline And Amorphous Ga2O3\n\nThe total pair-correlation functions for the crystalline (the ground-state monoclinic β-phase) and amorphous stoichiometric Ga2O3 with different densities are shown in Figure 2.10a. Similar to the three oxides considered earlier in this chapter (cf. Figures 2.1, 2.4, and 2.7), the nearest-neighbor Ga-O distances are generally maintained upon amorphization. However, the first-shell peak in amorphous Ga2O3 becomes higher than that in the crystalline oxide and maintains its width, and the longer Ga-O distances in the distribution are almost negligible (Figure 2.10a). The former result signifies that the coordination of Ga is likely to be more uniform than it is in the monoclinic β-phase Ga2O3 with two non-equivalent types of Ga atoms, half being four-coordinated and the other half six-coordinated. The absence of longer Ga-O distances in the distribution is consistent with the strongest Ga-O bonding among the four oxides considered. Given the low symmetry of the monoclinic gallium oxide, the O-O and Ga-Ga distributions coincide, resulting in a wide double-peak structure spread out from about 2.6 Å to 3.8 Å. Upon amorphization, this medium-range distribution becomes featureless. Hence, similar to the other oxides, and despite nearly identical first-shell distance distribution between the crystalline and amorphous Ga2O3, the disordered phase is expected to feature short-range (nearest-neighbor) disorder and significant changes in the way how the Ga-O polyhedra connect with each other to form a network, as can be seen in Figure 2.10c and 2.10d.\n\nThe optimal density of amorphous Ga2O3 was determined based on the energy–volume curve with at least 10 independent MD liquid-quench simulations performed for each density value (Figure 2.10b). The formation energy of different MD realizations varies within at least 0.04 eV/atom, and there is a significant overlap between the total energy for the configurations with different densities, giving a shallow minimum in the energy–density plot. Despite the large deviations in the total energy of different realizations with the same density, an average of 10 independent MD realizations provides a smooth curve and appears to be enough to predict an optimal density; clearly, one should avoid using only a few realizations to make conclusions. Most strikingly, the optimal density in amorphous Ga2O3 (5.23 g/cm3) is found to be as much as 19% lower than that in the monoclinic gallium oxide. This is significantly larger than the reduction of density in amorphous SnO2 and ZnO (about 7%)\nand In2O3 (almost 3%). To understand this result, first, we note that the monoclinic Ga2O3 is the most loosely packed structure among the four binary oxides considered in this work. The low-symmetry β-phase has primarily corner-shared GaO4 and GaO6 polyhedra that form ordered chains with large structural voids between them. As will be shown here, in amorphous Ga2O3, the majority of GaO polyhedra become undercoordinated and remain to be corner-shared; therefore, the density is strongly reduced. This is in contrast to amorphous ZnO and SnO2, both of which have (i) more edge-shared metal–metal connections and (ii) longer than typical metal–oxygen bonds as compared to the crystalline phase. These factors allow for better polyhedra packing in disordered ZnO and SnO2; therefore, both exhibit a moderate density reduction upon amorphization. Finally, bixbyite In2O3 not only is the most closely packed structure with half of the In-O polyhedra being edge-shared, but also has the weakest metal–oxygen bonding among the four oxides considered. The latter allows for In overcoordination (ECN >\n6 implies that an additional, seventh oxygen atom is in the first shell of such an In atom, albeit at a longer than average distance) and smaller In-O-In angles that help maintain good polyhedral packing.\n\n❦ ❦\n\n![72_image_0.png](72_image_0.png)\n\nThe experimental EXAFS measurements for the Ga K edge (Figure 2.10e) suggest that disorder completely suppresses the Ga second-shell (Ga-Ga) peak, whereas the first-shell (Ga-O) peak becomes slightly taller. Both results are in excellent agreement with our calculated pair-correlation functions for amorphous Ga2O3 at different densities (Figure 2.10a). As with amorphous In2O3 (Figure 2.1f), density has a strong effect on the Ga-Ga distances and coordination, although the calculated EXAFS shows little change in the intensity of the Ga-Ga peak below a density of 0.85ρc (Figure 2.10f). At the same time, we find that the Ga-O peak becomes taller as the density decreases. While the Ga-O peak position agrees well for the theoretical and experimental EXAFS (Figure 2.10f),\nthe short-distance shoulder observed experimentally in both crystalline and amorphous films but not in a bulk power sample (Figure 2.10e) is not well pronounced in the calculations. We believe that the experimental Ga2O3 may possess even lower density than the values studied theoretically (0.77ρc and higher).\n\nThe low symmetry of monoclinic Ga2O3 is also seen from the significant overlap between the Ga and O VDOS.\n\nUpon amorphization, the overlap is nearly unchanged, although the VDOS becomes featureless and low-frequency Ga modes appear at about 50 cm−1 (Figure 2.10e and 2.10f). High-frequency modes (around 750–800 cm−1), associated with oscillations of a few oxygen atoms with the largest VIPR value of about 0.4 and a single low-frequency mode (50 cm−1) for gallium, appear in the amorphous phase. Within the frequency range of about 80–350 cm−1 (i.e., where the Ga and O VDOS overlap), the VIPR values are comparable to or even lower than those in the crystalline Ga2O3 case, suggesting an evenly distributed vibration among different atoms.\n\nA comparison of the ECN distributions for the first-shell Ga-O and O-Ga polyhedra for crystalline and amorphous gallium oxide with perfect stoichiometry (i.e., for the oxygen-defect-free structures) is given in Figure 2.11a.\n\n![73_image_0.png](73_image_0.png)\n\nNormalized count\n\n![73_image_1.png](73_image_1.png)\n\nNormalized count\n❦\n2.6 The Structure and Properties of Crystalline and Amorphous Ga2O3 55 In monoclinic Ga2O3, there are two Ga and three O non-equivalent sites with different effective coordination and distances. Half of the Ga atoms are four-coordinated (ECN = 3.93 at 300K) with an average Ga-O distance of 1.84 Å, and the other half are six-coordinated (ECN = 5.59) with a distance of 1.98 Å (Table 2.1). The oxygen atoms are three- or four-coordinated (ECN = 2.83, 2.89, and 3.46 at room temperature). Upon amorphization, the coordination distributions for both gallium and oxygen do not become broader, as they do for In2O3, SnO2, and ZnO cases; yet both change as follows. For Ga, the number of atoms with ECN > 5 is nearly completely suppressed, and the distribution is shifted to the effective coordination ranging between four and five\n(Figure 2.11a). The distribution for the four-coordinated Ga is suppressed and slightly broadened toward lower values. Similarly, the amount of four-coordinated oxygen atoms, ECN(O) = 3–4, becomes negligible, whereas a small fraction of two-coordinated O atoms appears in the distribution (Figure 2.11a). The amount of three-coordinated O atoms increases in amorphous Ga2O3, and the corresponding distribution develops a tail that stretches toward ECN =2. Thus, similar to the other oxides, the seemingly insignificant changes in the first-shell distance distribution (Figure 2.10a) lead to a remarkable coordination transformation in amorphous Ga2O3, reducing the ECN\nvalues for both Ga and O atoms. We note here that the average Ga and O ECNs decrease with decreasing density\n(Table 2.1). Interestingly, the polyhedral distortions in amorphous Ga2O3 with higher density are comparable to those in amorphous In2O3, whereas at lower density the distortions become the smallest among all four oxides considered. This should be expected from the strongest metal–oxygen bonding in Ga2O3 as compared to the other three oxides.\n\nThe angle distributions for both O-Ga-O and Ga-O-Ga slightly widen and become uniform in the amorphous Ga2O3 (Figure 2.11b). Although the amount of six-coordinated Ga atoms is negligible, the characteristic O-Ga-O\nangles (70∘, 95∘, and 170∘) are still present in the five-coordinated Ga-O polyhedra. The Ga-O-Ga angle distribution preserves the double-peak structure, consistent with negligible changes in the fraction of edge- and corner-shared Ga-Ga pairs, as discussed in section 2.7.\n\nTo further understand the coordination transformations in perfectly stoichiometric Ga2O3, the time-averaged ECN values for individual Ga and O atoms are plotted as a function of their time-averaged effective distance and distortion for both crystalline and amorphous oxide (Figure 2.11c). No single occurrence of octahedrally coordinated Ga, with an ECN and lav that are the same as in crystalline monoclinic oxide, is found among 10 MD\nrealizations (540 Ga atoms) of the amorphous phase. A characteristic dependence for the two structural parameters is well-defined: The lower the ECN(Ga), the shorter the effective distance for the given polyhedra. Distortion slightly increases with decreasing the coordination within each of the ECN groups. Amorphous Ga2O3, is the only case where the oxygen structural distributions include the values for the O atoms in the crystalline β-phase inside the distribution (Figure 2.11c), rather than on its edges (cf. Figures 2.2c, 2.5c, and 2.8c). Yet, despite the similarity of the ECN(O) distributions in the crystalline and amorphous Ga2O3 (Figure 2.11a), the majority of O\natoms (independent of the coordination) have nearest-neighbor distances and O-Ga polyhedra distortions that deviate significantly from those in the monoclinic gallium oxide.\n\nFigure 2.12a–2.12d compares the charge density distributions in the highest valence band and the lowest conduction band in the fully relaxed crystalline and amorphous Ga2O3 structures. Similar to In2O3, SnO2, and ZnO\ncases (cf. Figures 2.3a–2.3d, 2.6a–2.6d, and 2.9a–2.9d), only a few oxygen atoms contribute at the top of the valence band, and the calculated Bader charge distribution for the O atoms (Figure 2.12e) features a strong asymmetry, with the majority of oxygen atoms giving negligible contributions. The conduction band charge in amorphous Ga2O3 is not uniform, and a significant fraction of the Ga atoms have small or negligible contributions to the conduction states, so that several of the 10 structures do not exhibit a fully connected three-dimensional conductivity path throughout the supercell (Figure 2.12b). Indeed, the individual Bader charge distribution for Ga atoms is more asymmetric with respect to the expected uniform charge value than for the other three metals (cf.\n\nFigures 2.3f, 2.6f, and 2.9f). Similar to indium, tin, and zinc oxides, we do not find a clear correlation between the ECN, effective distance (lav), or distortion (σ2) of oxygen atoms and the corresponding valence Bader charge contribution.\n\n❦ ❦\n\n![75_image_0.png](75_image_0.png)\n\n## 2.7 Role Of Morphology In Structure–Property Relationships\n\nIn previous sections of this chapter, it was shown that the charge localization in the conduction band (represented by the Bader charge contributions from individual atoms) does not directly correlate with the effective coordination, effective distance, or polyhedral distortion of the given atom in amorphous oxides (Figures 2.3f, 2.6f, 2.9f, and 2.12f). However, further analysis of representative groups of distribution \"outliers\" suggests that a combination of the above structural parameters (e.g., the actual vs. expected effective distance for a given coordination of an atom, or the asymmetry of polyhedral distortions vs. the conventional coordination geometry) provides valuable insight into the complex structure–property relationships in AOSs.\n\nAmong the four binary oxides, a tin atom in amorphous SnO2 has the largest conduction charge contribution\n(15% of the total charge for the state). Figure 2.13a shows the oxygen environment around this Sn atom along with the conduction charge density distribution in the vicinity. The metal atom has a square pyramidal coordination, which is not found in crystalline stoichiometric SnO2, where all Sn atoms are octahedrally coordinated. Clearly, the square pyramidal O arrangement resembles an oxygen vacancy in a sub-stoichiometric crystalline oxide (i.e., a missing apical oxygen atom at the top vertex of an octahedron). However, we recall that the amorphous structures investigated in this work are perfectly stoichiometric (i.e., no oxygen defects have been introduced). Therefore, disorder plays a key role in stabilizing the square pyramidal arrangement—along with the significant charge accumulation around the metal and especially in the void where a sixth oxygen is expected for an octahedral coordination (Figure 2.13a). In the case shown, the calculated Bader charge on the Sn atom is as much as 21 times greater than the expected charge value for a uniform charge distribution (0.7% per atom in the supercell). It should be noted here that the distortion parameter is small for this Sn atom, σ2 = 0.0034 Å2, because the Sn-O distances in the square pyramid are nearly identical (for comparison, the average distortion for all Sn atoms in this SnO2 structure is 0.0087 Å2).\n\n❦ ❦\n\n![76_image_0.png](76_image_0.png)\n\nThe asymmetric distortions in the M-O polyhedra, where an M-O bond is clearly missing so that the central metal atom becomes \"exposed\" on one side of the polyhedra with no oxygen atom available to bond with in order to achieve a more uniform coordination geometry (cf. Figure 2.13a), are rare in *stoichiometric* AOSs.\n\nIt has been shown that the lack of lattice periodicity and the ionic nature of AOSs facilitate an extended structural relaxation near defects or impurities [11, 13], and this bond reconfiguration helps either (i) shift a metal atom to the center of mass of the available oxygen atoms to even out the negative charges around the metal atom, or (ii) attract an additional oxygen atom from a nearby polyhedron to be shared by the two metal atoms. In other words, the observed bond disorder in stoichiometric AOSs (namely, the broad distance distributions in the individual M-O polyhedra [Figures 2.2c, 2.5c, 2.8c, and 2.11c] and the accompanying diversity of coordination transformations e.g., from octahedral or trigonal prismatic to square pyramidal to trigonal bipyramidal to tetrahedral, with variable degrees of polyhedral distortions) is a result of the ionic nature of the AOSs that drive the structural reconfigurations toward achieving a uniform distribution of the positive and negative charges throughout the structure. When the structure does not allow for bond rearrangement, for example, due to undercoordination of neighboring metal atoms that have shorter (stronger) M-O bonds and thus cannot share their oxygen atoms, or due to lack of oxygen in non-stoichiometric oxides, the formation of polyhedra with severe asymmetry will lead to charge imbalance and strong electron localization (as typically occur in crystalline ionic oxides or in covalent materials with stronger bonding). Hence, the degree of localization is determined by the ability of the surrounding structure to adjust to a specific defect and reduce charge imbalance.\n\nA more common structural defect that causes electron localization in stoichiometric AOSs is shown in Figure 2.13b. This Sn atom with an effective coordination of 5.0 has a notably longer effective Sn-O distance\n(2.14 Å) than is expected (2.06 Å) for this ECN value. (We recall here that ECN(Sn) has a distinct slope when plotted as a function of the Sn-O distance, with distances being shorter for smaller coordination numbers; Figure 2.5c.) The Sn atom with longer than expected Sn-O distances, shown in Figure 2.13b, has a conduction band Bader charge contribution (2% of the total charge) that is more than twice the value expected for a uniform charge distribution in the cell (0.7% per atom in the cell). This corresponds to a weak localization associated with a rather small charge imbalance. All four stoichiometric binary oxides possess a notable fraction of such metal atoms with longer than expected distances for a given ECN (Figures 2.2c, 2.5c, 2.8c, and 2.11c), and these atoms are found to have a Bader charge that is larger than the expected value for a uniform distribution\n(Figures 2.3f, 2.6f, 2.9f, and 2.12f). These \"outliers\" are spread randomly in the structure; they do not show a tendency to pair up or cluster with each other. It must be noted that these longer than expected distances resemble a three-dimensional strain for the metal atom and are more likely to occur in low-density amorphous materials.\n\nThe highly delocalized nature of the conduction band in AOSs is associated with multi-atom formations in which the mutual orientation of undercoordinated and/or highly distorted M-O polyhedra enables direct overlap of the neighboring metals' s-orbitals (Figure 2.13c). The charge density extends into the interstitial region connecting two or more metal atoms, resulting in the formation of tree-like branches or chains woven into the rest of the network. Therefore, medium-range structural characteristics (i.e., how the differently coordinated and/or distorted polyhedra are connected with each other to form an amorphous network) must be included in consideration in addition to the individual structural parameters and Bader charges. For the four connected Sn atoms shown in Figure 2.13c, the Bader charge accumulation is 1.6, 1.8, 2.3, and 3.3 times greater than the value for the uniform charge distribution; the corresponding effective coordination numbers (5.8, 4.9, 5.8, and 5.3, respectively), effective average distances (2.12 Å, 2.06 Å, 2.12 Å, and 2.11 Å, respectively), and polyhedral distortions\n(0.0032 Å2, 0.0017 Å2, 0.0041 Å2, and 0.0169 Å2, respectively) for these Sn atoms do not serve as predictors of the enhanced conduction charge density (cf. Figure 2.12f). Analyzing the individual Sn-O distances that connect the four Sn atoms shown in Figure 2.13c, we find that the majority of them are notably or significantly longer (the average of 10 Sn-O distances is 2.17 Å, ranging from 2.05 Å to 2.39 Å) than the average Sn-O distance (2.09 Å) in amorphous SnO2 at the same density (Table 2.1). What is more important, however, is the position of the oxygen atom(s) shared by each metal pair with respect to the line connecting these metal atoms, because it ultimately\n❦ ❦\ndetermines the possibility for direct s-s orbital overlap. In the SnO2 case shown in Figure 2.13c, two fully coordinated Sn atoms (ECN = 5.8) that share one oxygen atom with each other are located at a shorter Sn-Sn distance\n(3.55 Å) and smaller Sn-O-Sn angle (109∘) as compared to a corner-shared Sn-Sn pair in crystalline SnO2 (3.71 Å with a Sn-O-Sn angle of 129∘). The combination of a shorter metal–metal distance accompanied by a smaller M-O-M angle originates from elongated M-O distances and signifies that the shared oxygen atom moves farther away from the line connecting the two metal atoms (Figure 2.13d and 2.13e). Similarly, two edge-shared Sn atoms in Figure 2.13c are found at a longer distance from each other (3.50 Å) than the typical Sn-Sn pair that shares two oxygen atoms in crystalline oxide (3.19 Å). In this case, the edge-shared polyhedra tilt with respect to each other, making the angle between two OMO planes to be equal to 130∘ so that both oxygen atoms are away from the line that connects the metal atoms (Figure 2.13e). In contrast, two metal atoms and their shared oxygen atoms are co-planar in rutile SnO2 (Figure 2.13d). Thus, sharing defects, arising due to the presence of longer than usual M-O distances, may favor direct s-s orbital overlap and are quantified by the individual metal–metal distance combined with the M-O-M angle in the case of corner-shared M-M pairs and by the angle between two O-M-O planes in case of edge-shared pairs.\n\nTo understand the effect of disorder on the medium-range structure in AOSs, the M-M distance distributions for the edge- and corner-shared M-O polyhedra are compared for the crystalline and amorphous binary oxides at room temperature (Figure 2.14). In bixbyite In2O3, each In atom shares two oxygen atoms with six In neighbors (with an In-In distance of 3.4 Å) and also shares one oxygen atom with another six In atoms (with an In-In distance of 3.7 Å) (i.e., there are equal amounts of edge- and corner-shared pairs for each metal atom). In rutile SnO2, each Sn atom has two Sn neighbors that are edge-shared (Sn-Sn distance: 3.2 Å) and eight Sn neighbors that are corner-shared (Sn-Sn distance: 3.7 Å). In wurtzite ZnO, all Zn atoms have 12 corner-shared Zn neighbors at a\n\n![78_image_0.png](78_image_0.png)\n\nZn-Zn distance of 3.3 Å. In monoclinic Ga2O3, the four-coordinated Ga atom has nine corner-shared neighbors\n(Ga-Ga distances: 3.1–3.4 Å), while the six-coordinated Ga atom has four edge-shared (Ga-Ga distance: 3.1 Å) and seven corner-shared atoms (Ga-Ga distances: 3.2–3.4 Å). While the room temperature broadens the M-M distance distributions, only in β-phase Ga2O3 do the edge- and corner-shared distributions overlap (Figure 2.14a), owing to the low symmetry of the crystal structure.\n\nDisorder has a pronounced effect on M-O polyhedra sharing, as should be expected from the wide bond distance distributions and strong distortions in the M-O polyhedra (Figures 2.2c, 2.5c, 2.8c, and 2.11c). Both edgeand corner-shared distributions broaden and overlap significantly in amorphous oxides, including ZnO where a small fraction of edge-shared pairs appear (Figure 2.14a). Except for the edge-shared distribution in amorphous In2O3 and corner-shared distribution in amorphous Ga2O3, all other distribution peaks shift from the corresponding crystalline values. The considerable fractions of the longer or shorter than expected M-M distances for the given sharing type (edge- or corner-shared) imply that the sharing defects shown in Figure 2.13e are likely to occur in all four amorphous oxides, yet there are important differences in the morphology of the four oxides. Figure 2.14b plots the number of the edge-shared neighbors as a function of the number of the corner-shared neighbors for every individual M atom in amorphous oxide structures. While the general trend—the lower the number of edge-shared pairs, the higher the number of corner-shared pairs—can be observed, the effect of disorder is different among the oxides: In In2O3, the number of edge-shared pairs is suppressed upon amorphization, whereas ZnO and especially SnO2 feature an increased number of edge-shared polyhedra in the amorphous phases as compared to the crystalline oxides. A reduction in the number of M-O connections (e.g., when edge-shared pairs become corner-shared)\nand elongation of the M-M distances, both associated with longer M-O bond lengths, are expected in low-density amorphous oxides. However, all four oxides also feature outliers that have either higher than the expected number of edge- or corner-shared neighbors or an increased number of the total shared neighbors (edge- and corner-shared numbers combined; Figure 2.14b). The wide distributions in the numbers of edge-versus-corner neighbors imply that the morphology of the amorphous oxides is complex and the medium-range structural characteristics must be considered when deriving the comprehensive structure–property relationships in AOSs.\n\nAll four amorphous oxides show some degree of interatomic charge density chain-like formations in the conduction band (Figures 2.3c, 2.6c, 2.9c, and 2.12c); however, the chains may not extend throughout the entire unit cell.\n\nTo quantify the differences between the oxides, we compare the width of the single s-like conduction band. The bandwidth reflects the degree of hybridization of the conduction states and also determines the electron velocity once the material is doped. Hence, it is instructive to correlate the conduction band widths with the charge density distribution in each amorphous oxide structure and also with its structural morphology. First, the conduction band energy dispersions calculated along the [111] direction (i.e., along the diagonal of the cubic supercell) for both crystalline and amorphous In2O3 are shown in Figure 2.15a. The curvature at the bottom of the conduction band is similar in the crystalline and amorphous indium oxide, resulting in effective electron mass of 0.22 me and 0.17 me, respectively [11]. However, the width of the conduction band is reduced from 2.8 eV in crystalline In2O3 to at least 2.21 eV and at most 1.95 eV in the amorphous cases. The range of the bandwidth values in the amorphous In2O3 (Figure 2.15b) is represented by 10 different structures obtained via MD liquid-quench simulations at the same density, cooling rate, and stoichiometry, and is a result of morphology differences in these 10 realizations. Importantly, the variable bandwidth values translate into different electron velocities, calculated using a two-electron rigid-band shift to be equal to 1.7×106 m/s for crystalline In2O3 and 5.6×105 m/s or 1.7×105 m/s for the two amorphous cases with the widest and the narrowest conduction bands, respectively. Since the conductivity is proportional to the square of the electron velocity, the variation in the bandwidths of these two amorphous configurations is expected to result in up to a 10-time difference in their conductivity, provided the carrier concentration, scattering mechanisms, and relaxation times (that also determine the conductivity) remain the same for the two structures.\n\nThe conduction bandwidths for the four amorphous binary oxides, calculated for 10 different realizations in each case, are compared in Figure 2.15b. On average, the conduction bandwidth in indium oxide is wider by at least\n❦ ❦\n\n![80_image_0.png](80_image_0.png)\n\n0.5 eV than it is in SnO2, ZnO, or Ga2O3; this may explain the best performance of In-based AOSs. The distribution of the bandwidth values among different realizations for the same metal oxide (prepared at the same density, oxygen stoichiometry, and quench rate) provides further important insights into the complex structure–property relationships in AOSs. Specifically, the conduction bandwidths vary the least in ZnO (from 1.51 eV to 1.66 eV), with the range increasing in In2O3 (from 1.95 eV to 2.21 eV), followed by Ga2O3 (from 1.44 eV to 1.72 eV), and then SnO2\n(from 1.37 eV to 1.85 eV). This signifies that as-grown tin oxide samples, and to a lesser degree indium and gallium oxides, may have complex morphology, leading to a broad range of properties that are sensitive to deposition conditions and postdeposition treatment. To highlight the effect of morphology on the electronic properties, the charge density distributions in the amorphous SnO2 structures with the widest and the narrowest conduction bands are shown in Figure 2.15e and 2.15f; the integrated charge densities are compared for the two cases in Figure 2.15c. Clearly, the widest conduction band corresponds to the most uniform charge distribution within the supercell; vice versa, the charge density is uneven in the structure with the narrowest bandwidth, with significant accumulation in some areas and very low charge in the other parts of the supercell. Figure 2.15g and 2.15h show the Sn-O polyhedra with the largest and the lowest Bader charge contributions, respectively, and illustrate how these polyhedra are connected with each other within the supercell. Based on the peculiarities of the structural distributions for the four amorphous binary oxides, the following conclusions can be made:\n❦ ❦\n1. In amorphous SnO2, the ECN(Sn) distribution is the widest among the four metal oxides (ΔECN(Sn) = 2.8; Figure 2.5); in addition, about a third of the Sn-O polyhedra are edge-shared. Both factors contribute to the morphological richness in the disordered tin oxide. The presence of shorter (longer) than usual corner(edge)-shared Sn-Sn distances is beneficial for the formation of the conduction channels. At the same time, a large fraction of the Sn-O polyhedra possesses an increased number of edge-shared neighbors (from two in rutile SnO2 to six in amorphous tin oxide; Figure 2.2b), suggesting a tendency for clustering. As a result, while some SnO2 structures may have a conduction bandwidth comparable to that in In2O3, others show the narrowest bandwidth, and hence the lowest electron velocity, among the four binary oxides (Figure 2.15b). Consequently, amorphous SnO2 is expected to exhibit sample-to-sample stability and reliability issues as well as limited electron transport due to clustering.\n\n2. Amorphous ZnO shows the smallest variance in the conduction bandwidth values for different realizations\n(Figure 2.15b) that is in accord with the narrowest ECN distribution (Figure 2.8), and also with the finding that 90% of the neighboring polyhedra remain to be corner-shared upon amorphization (Figure 2.15d). The most uniform coordination and polyhedral-sharing morphologies among the four oxides imply that amorphous ZnO-based materials are expected to provide similar electronic properties from sample to sample. At the same time, only a negligible fraction of metal atoms exhibits shorter than expected Zn-Zn corner-shared distances\n(Figure 2.14a), which suggests that the s-s overlap is likely to be limited to a few nearest neighbors (Figure 2.9b),\nrestricting the carrier mobility.\n\n3. As expected for the strongest metal–oxygen bond, the Ga-O polyhedral distortions in amorphous Ga2O3 are the lowest among the four oxides and comparable to those in the monoclinic phase (Table 2.1). Moreover, the Ga-O-Ga angle, Ga-Ga distance, and edge-versus-corner distributions resemble those in crystalline oxide\n(Figures 2.11b, 2.14a, 2.14b, and 2.15d), so that disorder in this oxide is mostly driven by the ECN transition from six- to five- and four-coordinated Ga (Figure 2.11). The coordination morphology determines the bandwidth variations in amorphous Ga2O3 and may result in charge clustering (Figure 2.12c). A direct s-s overlap is unlikely due to shorter than usual edge-shared Ga-Ga distances (clustering) and no shorter than expected Ga-Ga corner-shared pairs, leading to the smallest probability of interstitial charge density in the stoichiometric amorphous Ga2O3 among the four oxides considered. Nevertheless, the extrapolated experimental bulk electron mobility of β-phase Ga2O3 is high, 300 cm2/Vs for carrier concentrations of 1015–1016 cm–3, making the wide-bandgap material an excellent candidate for power electronics in ultrahigh-voltage-switching applications [45]. Moreover, semiconducting amorphous Ga2Ox thin films with Hall mobility of 8 cm2/Vs and carrier concentration of 1014 cm–3 have been successfully fabricated when tuning the oxygen partial pressure [46].\n\n4. The best conductivity is expected in amorphous In2O3 and in In-rich AOSs, as indeed observed for the In-X-O\nmaterials [47]. Apart from the low formation energy for oxygen defects [11], the origin of the good transport properties in a-In2O3 is in the broad ECN(In) distribution and the widest In-In distance distribution among the four oxides. Specifically, the largest fraction of shorter than usual corner-shared In-In distances (Figure 2.14a)\nfacilitates the formation of the conduction channels. At the same time, the coordination and sharing morphologies may lead to sample-to-sample inconsistencies in the observed transport properties, and additional preparation conditions or postdeposition treatment might be required to achieve percolation via the conduction channels and hence best carrier mobility.\nDisorder introduces significant optical absorption within the visible range of undoped, perfectly stoichiometric, amorphous In2O3, SnO2, and ZnO, but not Ga2O3 (Figure 2.16a). The onset of the absorption from as low as 1.5 eV (3.0 eV in the case of Ga2O3) and its slowly rising behavior (as opposed to a sharper absorption onset typical for transparent conducting oxides) is attributed to (i) the non-uniform charge density distributions due to variable contributions in the conduction band (Figures 2.3b, 2.6b, 2.9b, and 2.12b); (ii) the valence tail states associated with the strongly localized nonbonding O--p-states (Figures 2.3d, 2.3e, 2.6d, 2.6e, 2.9d, 2.9e, 2.12d, and 2.12e); and\n(iii) the weaker metal–oxygen interaction associated with the slightly elongated average M-O distances (Table 2.1).\n\nWe must stress, however, that the insulating behavior may be difficult to achieve in AOSs because, typically, the amorphous oxide samples are sub-stoichiometric, hydrogenated, and/or possess oxygen-related defects that dope the material n-type by shifting the Fermi level into the conduction band. In crystalline oxides, the O2 defect is known as the Frenkel defect that forms when an oxygen atom moves away from its lattice site, leaving an oxygen vacancy behind, to combine with another oxygen. Depending on the degree of interaction with the surrounding periodic lattice, the O defect may have different charge states and also may release one or two electron(s) that become free carriers. Among the four amorphous oxides investigated, In2O3 and SnO2 show the strongest tendency for O2 formation with 100% and 90% of the MD realizations, respectively, having the peroxide defect; whereas only\n❦ ❦\n\n![82_image_0.png](82_image_0.png)\n\n8% and 2% of the ZnO and Ga2O3 configurations, respectively, have the O2 formed. In all cases, the O-O distance in the O2 defect is about 1.5 Å, which is typical for O2 2− peroxide in a lattice with both oxygen atoms in the defect bonded to neighboring metal atoms. We find that in all cases with an O2 defect, the Fermi level shifts up by about 1.5 eV, 1.3 eV, 1.2 eV, and 1.2 eV for amorphous In2O3, SnO2, ZnO, and Ga2O3, respectively, as calculated with respect to the conduction band minimum located at the Γ point. As a result of the pronounced Fermi-level shift, the optical window widens and the stoichiometric materials become nearly transparent within the visible range because of a low absorption associated with the intraband transitions (i.e., within the half-occupied conduction band), characteristic of non-stoichiometric oxides.\n\n## 2.8 The Role Of Composition In Structure–Property Relationships: Igo And Igzo\n\nThe structural characteristics of the amorphous binary oxides discussed in this chapter serve as a solid foundation for understanding the complex properties of multi-cation AOSs. In this work, we use amorphous (In0.6Ga0.4)2O3 and InGaZnO4 (with In:Ga:Zn=1:1:1) to illustrate (i) changes in the structural and electronic properties that occur with decreasing In content, and (ii) how the properties are affected by inherent structural preferences of the additional metal oxides.\n\nFirst, the optimal density of amorphous multi-cation oxides was determined via energy–density curves with at least 10 independent MD liquid-quench simulations performed for each density (Figure 2.17a and 2.17d). Similar to the amorphous binary oxides (Figures 2.1a, 2.4a, 2.7a, and 2.10a), in multi-cation AOSs (i) the formation energy of different MD realizations varies within 2–3 eV/cell, (ii) a single MD realization at each density is not enough to predict optimal density, and (iii) there is a substantial overlap between the total energy for the configurations with different densities, giving a shallow minimum in the energy–density plots, especially in the case of InGaZnO4 (Figure 2.17d). The results imply that amorphous oxide samples are likely to have a wide range of densities, sensitive to the deposition technique and pre- or postdeposition conditions. Moreover, the density may fluctuate from sample to sample, making the structural characterization challenging. In the discussion here, the amorphous (In0.6Ga0.4)2O3 and InGaZnO4 structures with a density of 6.07 g/cm3 and 5.71 g/cm3 are used unless density dependence is discussed.\n\nTo validate the theoretical amorphous models, the EXAFS is calculated for each metal K edge for the amorphous models with different densities. The simulated structures for both multicomponent oxides show excellent agreement between the calculated and experimental EXAFS for In, Ga, and Zn (Figure 2.17b and 2.17e). In amorphous InGaZnO4, a notable dependence on the density is found for the first-shell In and Ga peaks. Specifically, the In peak decreases and Ga peak increases with density decreasing, making the optimal density structures provide the best agreement with experimental EXAFS [12, 48]. Next, the total and partial VDOS were calculated for the most stable amorphous multi-cation structures to verify their dynamical stability. In addition, the VIPR was calculated from the normalized displacement vectors to determine the localization of different vibrational modes. The results, shown in Figure 2.17c and 2.17f, demonstrate that, similar to binary oxides, the disordered structures exhibit featureless VDOS within the entire range of frequencies and a notable overlap between the metal and O VDOS. In amorphous (In0.6Ga0.4)2O3, although several oxygen atoms that oscillate at normal modes with high frequencies around 550–750 cm−1 have a VIPR value of 0.2, it is significantly lower as compared to VIPR(O) in binary In2O3 (0.6) (Figure 2.1h) or Ga2O3 (0.4) (Figure 2.10h). This suggests that the multi-cation structure may help suppress the localization of specific vibrational modes by broadening the frequency range and the number of atoms with weakly localized modes. In InGaZnO4, a few oxygen atoms that oscillate at normal modes with high frequencies around 700–750 cm−1 have a VIPR value of 0.6, which is similar to that of amorphous In2O3 (Figure 2.1h). In both amorphous (In0.6Ga0.4)2O3 and InGaZnO4, frequencies below 500 cm−1 show low VIPR values, suggesting an evenly distributed vibration among different atoms within most of the spectrum.\n\n❦ ❦\n\n![84_image_0.png](84_image_0.png)\n\n![85_image_0.png](85_image_0.png)\n\nA comparison of the ECN distributions for the first-shell M-O and O-M polyhedra for the amorphous\n(In0.6Ga0.4)2O3 and InGaZnO4 structures with optimal density and perfect stoichiometry (i.e., for the oxygen-defect-free structures) is given in Figure 2.18a and 2.18d. The ECN(Ga) distributions in the amorphous (In0.6Ga0.4)2O3 and InGaZnO4 structures are nearly identical and also similar to that in binary Ga2O3\n(Figure 2.11a), with the exception that the number of four(five)-coordinated Ga atoms increases (decreases) in both multi-cation oxides. The ECN(Zn) in amorphous InGaZnO4 reveals that the number of four-coordinated Zn atoms is slightly reduced, the three-coordinated Zn atoms are nearly completely suppressed, and the small fraction of five-coordinated Zn appears. The presence of five-coordinated Zn atoms is in accord with the Zn environment in a crystalline InGaZnO4 structure. The coordination of In atoms in the amorphous (In0.6Ga0.4)2O3 and InGaZnO4 structures shows the largest deviation from that in binary amorphous oxide: In the latter, only about one-third of In atoms have an effective coordination below five, whereas half of In atoms have an ECN < 5.\n\nMoreover, the number of four-coordinated In atoms (ECN < 4) increases in amorphous InGaZnO4 as compared to the amorphous (In0.6Ga0.4)2O3 structure (i.e., it increases with decreasing In content in multi-cation oxide;\n\n| Metal-Oxygen

The trend in the ECN changes with the smallest, moderate, and largest deviations from the effective coordination of binary oxides among Ga, Zn, and In, respectively, is expected from the corresponding metal–oxygen bond strengths. The stronger the first-shell bonding is, the more likely it is that the metal atom will maintain its coordination preference in a multi-cation amorphous oxide [10, 47], and vice versa.\n\nDensity-dependent average ECN values for the amorphous multicomponent and binary oxides are compared in Tables 2.1 and 2.2. In both amorphous (In0.6Ga0.4)2O3 and InGaZnO4, the coordination of oxygen is significantly reduced as compared to that in binary constituent oxides.\n\nFigure 2.18b and 2.18e show the number of shared neighbors (face-, edge-, or corner-shared) of the same metal type as a function of the number of the shared neighbors of the opposite metal type for every individual M atom in the amorphous oxide structures. In general, the results suggest that there is no segregation of the different metal atoms. A very small fraction of metal atoms (In or Ga) has only In neighbors, and all M atoms have at least two In neighbors in the amorphous (In0.6Ga0.4)2O3. In InGaZnO4, all metal atoms have at least two shared neighbors of an opposite metal type, and a few metal atoms (In, Ga, or Zn) are isolated (i.e., have no shared neighbors of their own type). Consistent with the predominantly corner-sharing preference of Ga and Zn in the corresponding binary oxides (cf. Figures 2.14a, 2.14b, and 2.15d), both have a lower number of shared metal atoms in (In0.6Ga0.4)2O3 and InGaZnO4 as compared to In, which has the largest fraction of edge-shared pairs in amorphous In2O3 (about 30%). Despite the well-mixed nature of the multi-cation amorphous structures, the wide distributions in the numbers of shared neighbor types represent the structural randomness at the medium range and imply complex morphology that should be taken into account, especially when doping, defect formation, and/or hydrogenation are studied in AOSs.\n\nDespite the rather uniform spatial distributions of different metal atoms in a-(In0.6Ga0.4)2O3 and a-InGaZnO4, the conduction band is governed primarily by indium in both oxides, as signified by the calculated Bader charge contributions from individual metal atoms (Figure 2.18c and 2.18f). Only a small fraction of Ga and/or Zn have a Bader charge above the average value, which represents a uniform charge distribution. Although the largest Bader contribution is from four-coordinated In (Figure 2.18c and 2.18f), there is no clear correlation between the ECN of any metal atoms and the corresponding conduction Bader charge contribution, similar to the amorphous binary oxides (Figures 2.3f, 2.9f, and 2.12f).\n\nThe conduction bandwidths for the two amorphous multi-cation oxides, calculated along the [111] direction for 10 different MD realizations in each case, are compared in Figure 2.19a. On average over the realizations, the conduction bandwidth is wider in a-(In0.6Ga0.4)2O3 (1.66 eV) than in a-InGaZnO4 (1.57 eV), as should be expected from the larger In content in the former case. The distribution of bandwidth values among different realizations for the same composition (obtained at the same density, oxygen stoichiometry, and quench rate) illustrates the effect of morphology on the resulting electronic properties. Interestingly, the bandwidth distribution in a-(In0.6Ga0.4)2O3 resembles the one in binary a-Ga2O3 (Figure 2.18b), with only a few configurations having larger bandwidths than that in the binary gallium oxide. The bandwidth distribution shrinks with the addition of Zn in a-InGaZnO4—in agreement with the results for binary a-ZnO (Figure 2.18b). The charge density distributions in the amorphous\n(In0.6Ga0.4)2O3 structures with the widest and the narrowest conduction bands are shown in Figure 2.19b: The widest conduction band corresponds to a charge accumulation along an In-O polyhedral chain running through the supercell; vice versa, the charge density is clustered in the structure with the narrowest bandwidth, with significant accumulation at an In-O cluster centered in the middle of the supercell. As discussed in Section 2.7, good transport properties in In-based AOSs originate from the widest In-In distance distribution among the four oxides, specifically from the largest fraction of shorter than usual corner-shared In-In distances (Figure 2.14a), which facilitates the formation of conduction channels. Figure 2.19c compares the In-In distance distribution in amorphous In2O3, (In0.6Ga0.4)2O3, and InGaZnO4. It is seen that the In-In distributions in the multi-cation oxides are nearly identical and feature a reduced number of edge-shared In-In pairs and a single peak in the corner-shared In-In distribution as compared to the binary indium oxide. A smaller number of the short-distant corner-shared In-In pairs that enable s-s orbital overlap (Figure 2.13) explains the reduction in conduction bandwidths in the multi-cation oxides, as compared to a-In2O3. At the same time, it has been shown that the spatial distribution of Ga in amorphous In-Ga-O plays an important role in promoting chain formation of undercoordinated In atoms and hence maintaining good transport properties when Ga content increases from 20 at.% to 40 at.% [49].\n\nHence, compositional morphology and the ability of amorphous structures to support the formation of extended conduction channels, associated with the structural chains of the In atoms having large (above-average) Bader contributions, determine good mobility in multi-cation AOSs [13, 47]. At the same time, rich morphology may lead to sample-to-sample inconsistencies in the observed transport properties, and additional preparation conditions or postdeposition treatment might be required to achieve a uniform composition morphology that ensures percolation via the conduction channels and thus the best conductivity.\n\n❦ ❦\n\n![88_image_0.png](88_image_0.png)\n\nWe note here that In-free AOSs follow a similar trend: The conductivity is governed by the metal atoms with the weakest bond strength, for example by Sn in amorphous Zn-Sn-O [50].\n\n## 2.9 Conclusions\n\nStructure randomness in amorphous oxides of posttransition metals originates from weak metal–oxygen bonding, ionic in nature, which is responsible for significant deviations in the bond lengths and bond angles for the majority of metal and oxygen atoms. The nearest-neighbor disorder, hidden in the average distance distributions, becomes apparent from the calculated effective coordination, effective average distances, and polyhedral distortions of individual M and O atoms, only a few of which have structural features that closely match those in the crystalline oxide phases. This implies that distance distributions in AOSs (obtained from pair-correlation functions or EXAFS)\n\n## 70 2 Electronic Structure And Structural Randomness\n\ndo not capture the degree of distortion in *individual* M-O polyhedra, which ultimately determines metal coordination, or prevalence of the distorted M-O polyhedra, which expands the coordination distribution.\n\nBroad distributions in coordination, bond angles, and polyhedral distortions give rise to an intricate morphology in AOSs that manifests itself in sharing disorder (i.e., structural randomness in the way that M-O polyhedra are connected with each other). Sharing disorder may promote clustering (e.g., a large number of edge-shared neighbors in a predominantly corner-shared network of amorphous ZnO and SnO2) but also enables direct s-s orbital overlap via a reduced M-M distance for corner-shared pairs. The latter is key to good mobility in AOSs, provided that the structure favors the formation of extended chains of such metal pairs with distorted sharing, leading to percolation-like conduction paths.\n\nImportantly, the majority of structural \"outliers\" in the stoichiometric oxides do not cause strong electron localization due to the ability of the disordered structure to rearrange its morphology via an extended bond reconfiguration that minimizes charge imbalance and promotes better hybridization. Therefore, defect-, impurity- or composition-induced transformations in morphology play important roles in the complex structure–property relationships in AOSs and must be carefully studied.\n\nFinally, structural randomness in AOSs with disorder in the local (nearest-neighbor), medium, and long ranges makes a theoretical description of electron transport challenging. Adhering to the Drude model, the electron mobility in an AOS can be represented with the following equation:\n\n❦\n$$={\\frac{m^{+}}{e}}$$\n1\n = m∗e\n(1\n$$\\left({\\frac{1}{\\tau_{d e f e c e s}}}+{\\frac{1}{\\tau_{c o m p o s i f i o n}}}+{\\frac{1}{\\tau_{m o r p h o l o y}}}+{\\frac{1}{\\tau_{v i b r a t i o n s}}}+{\\frac{1}{\\tau_{n a n o-c o r s t a l i n y}}}\\right)$$\n❦\nwhere the contributions to the overall relaxation time are due to (i) structural defects or impurities, (ii) spatial distribution and clustering of various cations, (iii) coordination and sharing morphology, (iv) thermal vibrations, and (v) size and density of nanocrystalline inclusions. The results of this work show that the above factors are interdependent, yet understanding their interplay provides keys to the ways the structural randomness can be tuned to attain percolation that would ensure reduced carrier scattering due to each of these factors.\n\n❦ ❦\n\n## References\n\n1 Nomura, K., Ohta, H., Takagi, A. et al.

It could be doped in both polarities, and it could be deposited over large areas at low cost with low surface roughness and without grain boundaries. However, it had two drawbacks: Its carrier mobility of ∼0.5 cm2/V.s was too low, and it suffered from a bias stress instability to charges and an illumination instability (the Staebler–Wronski effect). It was often assumed that by 2000, the next stage of development would be to use nanocrystalline Si, produced by laser crystallization or direct deposition, to greatly increase mobility, retain bipolar doping, and remove the origin of instabilities. However, nanocrystalline Si would still have grain boundaries and be less suitable for depositing reliable gate dielectrics for thin-film transistors (TFTs).\n\nThis did not occur. Instead, amorphous oxide semiconductors (AOSs) such as In-Ga-Zn oxide (IGZO) were developed with a much higher electron mobility of ∼10 cm2/V.s; ease of low-temperature, large-area deposition [1–3];\nand no grain boundaries, and these films rapidly displaced a-Si:H as the dominant semiconductor for display applications [3–5].\n\nIt is first necessary to give a description of the electronic structure of AOSs and explain why they have such a high electron mobility compared to a-Si:H. The post-transition metal oxides such as ZnO, In2O3, and SnO2 differ considerably from the alkaline–earth oxides like SrO. The divalent oxides like ZnO have electron affinities of ∼4.0 to 4.5 eV, not 2.0 eV like SrO [3], and are stable in contact with water. The band structure of a typical member SnO2 is shown in Figure 3.1 [6]. It has a band gap of around 3.6 V in the near-ultraviolet (near-UV) range. Its bonding is quite ionic, 60%, higher than SiO2 that still has a covalent network. In contrast, by symmetry, the conduction band minimum (CBM) of SnO2 is much more polar than the average state, and it consists almost entirely of cation\n(Sn) s states [7].\n\n❦ ❦\n\n## 3.2 Mobility\n\nThe field-effect mobility μFE is given by the free electron mobility μ0 times the fraction of the induced charges that remain in extended (free) states rather than in trapped states:\nFE = nfree nfree + *ntrapped* 0 (3.1)\nUsing SnO2 as the example, the electron conduction occurs between overlapping cation s states rather than between the antibonding sp3 orbitals of Si, as compared in Figure 3.2. The cation s states are spherically symmetric, Amorphous Oxide Semiconductors: IGZO and Related Materials for Display and Memory, First Edition.\n\nEdited by Hideo Hosono and Hideya Kumomi.\n\n© 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd. Published 2022 by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.\n\n![93_image_0.png](93_image_0.png)\n\nand so their overlap with adjacent s states is less sensitive to angular disorder (Figure 3.2b) [2, 8]. This contrasts with the directional antibonding sp3 states, whose interaction varies greatly with the disorder, as seen in Figure 3.2a. This leads to a much lower electron mobility for the disordered sp3 states.\n\nHowever, the argument is deeper than this original explanation. Let us compare the effect of ring disorder on the orbital phases at the CBM state, in crystalline and amorphous Si networks and in the oxides. The diamond lattice of c-Si consists of sixfold rings, whereas the a-Si network also has fivefold and sevenfold rings. The phases of the antibonding orbitals around the sixfold rings for the Γ2' state of c-Si are shown in Figure 3.3a. Despite the sign reversal along each antibond, the signs match up at each vertex, so there is constructive interference around a sixfold ring. Compare this to a fivefold ring, as found in a-Si. Now the sign reversal causes a destructive interference at the final (circled) vertex (Figure 3.3a).\n\nHowever, c-SnO2 contains two Sn sublattices in its rutile structure. The phases of Sn s orbitals are both positive for each sublattice at the CBM (the oxygen phases are negative), so there is constructive interference between the Sn s states. In the amorphous lattice, there can be even or odd rings of cations, but the phases of all Sn s orbitals are still in-phase for the CBM, giving constructive interference for both even- and odd-membered rings (Figure 3.3b).\n\nSimilar arguments extend to the oxide alloys.\n\nIn a-Si:H, these destructive interference effects cause a Hall effect sign anomaly, following the Friedman model of the Hall effect [9, 10]. In contrast, the constructive interference around both even- and odd-membered rings in the oxides means that there is no Hall effect sign anomaly, and there is no decline in the mobility as EF crosses the mobility edge, as is seen experimentally [11, 12].\n\n❦ ❦\n\n## 3.3 Density Of States\n\nThis constructive interference has a great effect on the conduction band (CB) tail of localized states for IGZO compared to a-Si:H. The density of states (DOS) at the top of the CB tail in a-Si:H is on the order of 1021 cm−3 eV−1, and its slope parameter is ∼25 meV [13, 14]. This means that the field effect mobility is only a fraction of the\n\n![94_image_0.png](94_image_0.png)\n\n❦ ❦\nextended state mobility, because the majority of charges induced by the TFT gate voltage remain trapped in tail states by Equation (3.1).\n\nThe equivalent values for a-IGZO are given in Table 3.1 from various measurement techniques, and are on the order of 1018 cm−3eV−1 and 20 meV, respectively [11, 15–20]. Thus, the reduced disorder means that the density of tail states for a-IGZO is at least 103 times lower than that of the a-Si:H tail. Thus, the much lower tail DOS of a-IGZO means that few of the induced charges are trapped in tail states, and its electron mobility remains close to its crystalline value by Equation (3.1), unlike in a-Si:H.\n\nThus, the DOS across the mobility gap of IGZO is shown schematically in Figure 3.4 and compared to that of a-Si:H [15]. There is the much lower DOS at the top of the CB tail at 0 eV in IGZO, a wide region of low DOS in the upper gap, then a higher DOS for 1 eV above the valence band maximum (VBM). The CB has a low effective mass m* from its calculated DOS versus energy of ∼0.3 me. As the band gap is ∼3.0 eV, and IGZO is strongly n-type, the intrinsic hole current of IGZO is extremely small.\n\nThe small tail state DOS of IGZO also means that the subthreshold swing (S) of their TFTs is lower. S is defined as [3]:\n\n![95_image_0.png](95_image_0.png)\n\n❦ ❦\nThe fundamental lower limit of S at 25 ∘C is ∼60 mV/decade. The subthreshold swings of a-Si:H TFTs are typically many times larger. IGZO with its lower tail DOS allows a much lower S and thus lower operating voltage.\n\nThe next key point about a-IGZO is its response to shifting the Fermi energy [8]. In a-Si:H, if the Fermi energy is moved above the CB mobility edge EC in a TFT, by gate bias or by bulk doping of the bulk, the network will try to rearrange itself by bond switching, which would cause the occupied state above EC to become a filled defect state\n(D−) below EC, and shift EF below EC again [21]. This is a fundamental property first noted by Street [21]. It is a network instability, which could be a bias stress instability in TFTs or a photo-induced instability (Staebler–Wronski effect). The reaction can be expressed as follows (and see Figure 3.5):\n\n$\\text{Si}_4{}^0+\\text{P}_3{}^0\\to\\text{Si}_3{}^-+\\text{P}_4{}^+$. \n+ (3.3)\nwhere subscripts are the coordination numbers. The reaction is one of a negative \"effective correlation energy\" (U) in that the half-filled tetrahedral P dopant site is transformed into an ionized dopant site P+ and a trivalent defect site D−.\n\n| Method                              | Author and Reference   | 𝚫 (meV)   | N (cm−3.eV−1)   |\n|-------------------------------------|------------------------|------------|-----------------|\n| Modulated PC                        | Erslev et al.

This is because the CB does not consist of directional covalent bonds, so it is not possible to create a distortion that locally creates a gap in the DOS at EF.\n\nThe network instead consists of a relatively close-packed array of spheres (the cation s orbitals). The CB of the oxide is largely parabolic in both phases, so the conductance increases with electron density [13, 14].\n\n## 3.4 Band Structures Of N-Type Semiconductors\n\nThe band structure of SnO2 was shown in Figure 3.1. Its CBM is due to Sn s states. The valence band (VB) top is due to O 2p lone pair states lying normal to the bonding plane of trivalent O sites. The highest state is arranged so that it gives a direct but optically forbidden transition to the CBM [7]. The first allowed transition is from −0.6 eV.\n\nA second deeper group of valence states down to −8 eV forms the Sn-O p-bonding states.\n\nIn2O3 has the cubic bixbyite structure with 80 atoms per unit cell. Its bonding is also quite ionic like SnO2. The character of its states is similar to that of SnO2; the CBM consists of In s states, the upper VB consists of O 2p lone pair states, and the deeper states are In-O p bonding states. Its band gap is calculated to be 2.6 eV using the SX approximation. The uppermost O 2p states of the VBM also give a direct forbidden optical band gap down to −0.8 eV [22]. This causes optical transitions from the upper ∼0.6 eV of VB states to the CB to be forbidden, giving an observed optical gap of 3.4 eV. This means that the apparent optical band gap is larger than the electrical band gap, which had led to the incorrect idea that In2O3 had an indirect gap away from Γ. The gap of In2O3 is slightly less than that of ZnO, and the In s orbitals are slightly wider than those of the Zn s states, so the In s states make the greater contribution to electron conduction in the IGZO alloy system [23, 24].\n\nThe third AOS member, ZnO, has a polar covalent lattice of tetrahedral Zn and O sites with electron-pair bonds\n[25, 26]. Its gap is 3.4 eV wide experimentally, and it has well-studied excitons. The Zn 3d states at −7 eV form shallow core levels (Figure 3.6) [26]. Some of these have the same symmetry as the O 2p VBM states. This leads to the Zn 3d states causing a narrower than usual band gap. The energy of the Zn 3d states can be used to grade the quality of a ZnO calculation. Ga2O3 has a wider band gap (∼4.7 eV) than ZnO, and its bonding is polar covalent.\n\nHowever, its lattice does not consist of 2-electron bonds. It also has CBM states consisting of cation s orbitals.\n\nA simple density functional method like the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) grossly underestimates the band gap of these oxides. The GGA gap is typically 0.9 eV for each oxide. GW gives correct values but is unnecessarily expensive. Hybrid functional methods that mix a fraction of Hartree–Fock (HF) exchange give a good\n❦ ❦\n\n![97_image_0.png](97_image_0.png)\n\n| Heat of Formation per O Atom (eV)   | Crystalline        | Amorphous          |\n|-------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| ZnO                                 | −3.87 (5.44 g/cm3) | −3.28 (4.62 g/cm3) |\n| Ga2O3                               | −4.21              |                    |\n| In2O3                               | −3.92              |                    |\n| IGZO                                | −3.91 (6.4 g/cm3)  | −3.60 (6.04 g/cm3) |\n\n❦ ❦\ndescription of the gap and at lower cost [27, 28]. The SX method, as used here, gives a good description of the bands. The HSE method with its degree of HF content increased to α = 37% also gives the correct band gap of 3.4 eV for ZnO [23].\n\nA lower cost method to obtain reasonable band structures is to use GGA but add a Hubbard U potential to the Zn 3d states [29]. The U downshifts the Zn 3d states, so they give less repulsion to the VBM O 2p states, thereby widening the gap. However, this U method can need unreasonably large U values to fit the experimental ZnO gap. It is better to apply U to both the Zn 3d states and O 2p states, which repels both Zn 3d and O 2p down. Values of 6 eV for U(d) and U(p) are less extreme, fit the gap, and still have a low GGA-like computational cost [30].\n\nWe now discuss the alloys. Crystalline InGaZnO4 was previously known as a semiconducting oxide. It has a fully bonded, layered lattice with a large z lattice constant [27, 28]. The lattice consists of Ga-O5 bipyramid units forming one layer and Zn-O4 tetrahedra and In-O6 units forming intervening layers. Walsh et al. [24] have found that the network of a-InGaZnO4 consists of a random packing of cation-centered polyhedra, with the same GaO5 bipyramids, ZnO4 tetrahedra, and InO6 octahedral units. The charge transfer from each cation to oxygens is quite similar to that in the crystalline phase. The mass density of InGaZnO4 falls from 6.4 g/cm3 for the crystal to 6.04 g/cm3 for the amorphous phase [30], but the density reduction is greater for pure ZnO. The CBM has a mixed s character on all the cations, with In s being the crucial one.\n\nTable 3.2 gives the heat of formation per O atom for each oxide, and also its value for their amorphous phases.\n\nIt is interesting that it costs 0.59 eV per O to make ZnO amorphous, a large value due to its poor glass-forming ability (Figure 3.7a). For comparison, IGZO takes only 0.31 eV per O atom to make it amorphous, consistent with its much easier glass-forming ability from the mixed cation effect (Figure 3.7b).\n\nThe role of the various components of IGZO is as follows [2, 31]. The In s states provide the main high-mobility electron-conducting path [27, 28]. ZnO is added to In2O3 to make it easier to disorder by the mixed cation effect.\n\nThe function of the third metal oxide in IGZO can be compared by its effect on the mobility, off-current, Urbach slope, and stability. It was found that the electron mobility in amorphous In-metal-zinc alloys follows the effective mass of the parent binary oxide [31]. However, this is only one factor. Ga2O3 has a wider gap than In2O3, but its electron affinity is similar to that of In2O3 (Figure 3.16a), so that it does not add any extra disorder potential for electrons, as seen in the partial density of states (PDOS) (Figure 3.7d).\n\nA major effect of adding Ga2O3 is to increase the cost of oxygen deficiency. Each oxygen site is bonded to one or more Ga sites, so the Ga-O bonds increase the formation energy of that O vacancy [30], and this causes a-IGZO\ntransistors to have a smaller off-current [3].\n\nSome oxides such as HfO2, Y2O3, SiO2, and TiO2 have larger heats of formation [32], which translates into higher oxygen vacancy formation energies, so they would decrease their device off-currents. But HfO2, Y2O3, and SiO2 have higher energy CBMs (as seen in Figure 3.7f), so these metals would reduce the electron mobility and would be expected to have larger CB tailing. Several alternatives such as TiO2 cause an increased CB tailing experimentally [31] but have similar electron affinities to Ga2O3.\n\nSome oxides like SnO2 have multiple valences (SnO) and are known to give rise to extra CB tail states and trapping instability. Finally, some oxides like ZnO can bond hydrogen atom pairs at oxygen vacancies, which may be the cause of illumination stress instabilities (see Section 3.5).\n\n![99_image_0.png](99_image_0.png)\n\n❦ ❦"

Chang Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, 3333 Coyote Hill RoadP, alo Alto, California 94304\n(Received 24 May 1988)\nWe propose that DX is a negatively charged defect center resulting from the \"reaction\" 2d d++DX where d represents a substitutional donor. The results of our pseudopotential calcula-tions for Si- and S-induced DX centers in GaAs indicate large dopant-dependent relaxations leading to threefold-coordinated interstitial sites for either the donor or one of its nearest neighbors. A simple ex-pression for the alloy composition and pressure dependence of the DX binding energy is suggested and used in an analysis of experimental data.\n\nPACS numbers: 61.70.At, 72.20.JV, 78.50.Ge The defect which gives rise to a deep donor level in AI\"Gat \"As alloys for x ~ 0.22 is commonly known as the DX center.'The defect also appears in n type-GaAs when pressures in excess of 20 kbar are applied or when the dopant concentration increases beyond 10' /cm (Ref. 9). The DX center has a repulsive bar-rier for both electron emission and capture, leading to persistent photoconductivity. In addition, there is typically an order-of-magnitude difference between its\n=O.l-eV thermal and =1-eV optical ionization ener-gies. '2's The large Stokes shift led Lang and coworkers' to propose that DX is a donor-defect complex which undergoes a large lattice relaxation. There is now strong evidence, however, that DX arises from a substitu-tional donor by itself. 3 9 This has led to suggestions that DX involves a displaced donor with either large' 'or, possibly, small\" lattice relaxations.\n\nIn this Letter we propose new structural models for Si-and S-induced defect centers in GaAs derived from ab initio self-consistent pseudopotential calculations. The energetics of DX formation and its electronic structure are also examined and the results for GaAs are extended to the Al\"Gat —\"As alloys with a simple model. The main conclusions from our calculations are the following:\n(i) The DX center is a highly localized and negatively charged center resulting from the reaction 2d ~d++DX ~CB=A[E(I )+3E(X)+4E(L)j/8. (3)\nwhere d and d+ represent neutral and ionized four-fold-coordinated substitutional donors. The donors d need not be spatially close to each other.\n\n(ii) Defect formation involves a large bond-rupturing displacement of either the donor atom itself (for SiG,) or one of its nearest-neighbor Ga (or Al) atoms (for Sp\")\nalong a bond axis. In the following discussions, the nota-tion DX is exclusively used to refer to the broken-bond configuration in order to distinguish it from the normal substitutional geometry denoted by d.\n\nAn immediate consequence of (i) is that DX should be electron-paramagnetic-resonance (EPR) inactive. To our knowledge, no EPR signal from DX has ever been reported in the literature. A recent study, with an enhanced sensitivity, by Khachaturyan, Weber, and Ka-minska' has also failed to reveal any EPR activity and has led them to propose that a \"negative U\" defect center is responsible for both the lack of EPR and the persistent photoconductivity of DX centers.\n\nIn the following, we first examine a simple expression for the variation of the thermal binding energy of DX\ncenters as a function of composition, pressure, and dopant concentration in Al, Ga t —\"As alloys.\n\nThe thermal binding energy of a neutral DX center relative to the conduction-band minimum (CBM) is ar-gued to vary with alloying (or with pressure) as\n~0(DX ) +FCBM AFCB (2)\nwhere EcaM is the energy of the CBM and Eca is the Brillouin-zone-averaged energy of the lowest conduction band, both measured relative to the valence-band max-imum (VBM). The assumption behind Eq. (2) is that DX is a localized defect, 9and the variation of its thermal occupancy level relative to the VBM, ~DX0, is nearly equal to AFca. Experimentally, only the variations of the energy bands at the I, X, and L points of the Bril-louin zone are well known. ' The Brillouin-zone average for ~ca can be determined from these points with the approximation '\nThe variations of the band edges in AI\"Ga~ —\"As alloys are nearly linear in x, for x~0.6, and the room-temperature values are given''by (in eV)\n\n$$E(L)=1.71+0.64x.$$\n$$E(X)=1.9+0.21x,$$\n$$E(\\Gamma)=1.42+1.25x,$$\n\nSubstitution in Eq. (3) yields\n\n$$(4)$$\n$\\eqref{eq:walpha}$. \n~CB=o.55~&. (5)\nEquation (4) indicates that for x ~ 0.46 the CBM is at 1988 The American Physical Society 873 1, and for x &0.46 it is at the X point. Equations\n(2)-(5) therefore give and AEp(DX ) =0.7hx, x ~ 0.46, (6)\n\n$$\\Delta E_{0}(D X^{0})=-\\,0.34\\Delta x,\\;\\;x>0.46,$$\nAEp(DX ) = —0.34Ax, x & 0.46, (7)\nFor a negatively charged center arising from Eq. (1),\nwe need the variation of the energy of DX +d+ rela-tive to 2d . If we use the same approach as before, this two-electron, two-site energy difference is expected to vary as\n~Eo(DX ) =28 (EcBM Eca) =2~o(DX ). (8)\nFor a neutral center, the ratio of the densities of d and DX centers is equal to exp[ PEp(DX—)], where P =1/\nkT. For the DX center, however, it is ,\n'Ep(DX—)\nthat enters the Boltzmann factor giving the relation be-tween the densities of do and DX centers. The reac-tion specified by Eq.

(10)\nThe temperature dependence of the DX concentration, therefore, cannot be used to determine the charge state of DX. The experimentally derived binding energies, '\nwhich are based on a /jEp dependence in the Boltzmann factor, need to be multiplied by 2 for a negatively charged state. To compare the predictions of the simple model to the experimental data of Chand et al. ,\n' we will use the expressions for ~p(DX ) given by Eqs. (6) and\n(7) while keeping the factor of 2 for the case of a nega-tive charge state in mind.\n\nEquations (6)-(8) show that the binding energy of DX\nrelative to the CBM increases with Al concentration un-til the direct-indirect band-gap transition at x =46% and then decreases. The predicted extremum of x=46% for the DX binding energy is in good agreement with the ex-perimentally determined3'5's range of 0.45 ~ x ~ 0.48.\n\nThe 0.7-eV prefactor in Eq. (6) is nearly identical with the 707-meV value obtained by Chand et al. 'from a best fit to their data. In this connection it is also in-teresting to look at the variation ~oxo of the DX\nthermal occupancy level relative to the VBM instead of the CBM. As discussed above in connection with Eq.\n\n(2), this variation is equal to AEca which from Eq. (5) is given by 0.55Ax for x in both the direct- and indirect-gap regimes. Since, from Eq. (4) the energy of the lowest conduction band at L varies as 0.64hx, the DX\ndonor level, relative to the VBM, moves as if it were nearly tracking the L conduction state. The correlation 874 between the motion of the two of 0.55/0. 64=86% is practically identical with the experimentally determined value of 0.54/0. 64=84%. This result shows that the L-like variation of the DX energy in Al\"Gat \"As alloys can be explained without the assumption that it is an L der-ived center T.he correlation between Eox and E(L) appears simply because the average energy of the lowest conduction band, Ecii, and therefore Eoxo in-crease with alloy composition at nearly the same rate as the energy at the L point. The accuracy of Eq. (3) used in obtaining this result may be partially assessed by our noting that the lowest-order \"special point\" averaging gives Eca=E(L).' This indicates that the L-like variation of the DX binding energy is not limited to A1GaAs alloys alone, but should also hold approximately in other systems. Special care is needed to distinguish a genuine-ly L-derived effective-mass level from the more spatially compact DX state in these situations.\n\nMaking use of the experimental result that at x=0.22, the thermal binding energy of DX becomes equal to that of shallow donors (=5 meV), the integra-tion of Eqs. (6) and (8) gives (in eV)\nEp(DX) (0.7x —0.15)(1+ q), x ~ 0.46,\n\n$$\\mathbf{\\mu}$$\n$\\tau$\n$$(10)$$\n\nwhere q assumes the values of 0 or 1 for DXo and DX\nrespectively. Equation (11) predicts that DX is unbound\n(i.e., metastable) by 0.15(1+q) eV in GaAs. From Eqs.\n\n(2) and (8), a charge state ind-ependent increase of 0.15 eV in EciiM —Eca would be needed to stabilize DX in GaAs. One method for the realization of this increase is through the application of pressure. In this case the thermal binding energy Ep is affected because of changes both in EzaM and in the average energy of the conduction-band states Eca. The pressure dependence of Ep(DX) can be easily calculated. The pressure coefficients of the conduction-band states at the I, X,\nand L points for GaAs are well known3 2' and, in meV/\nkbar, are equal to\n\n$$\\mathbf{\\varepsilon}=12,$$\n\n## Be (R)/Bp =12,\n\n$$\\delta E(X)/\\delta P=-1.6,$$\n$$(12)$$\n$$\\delta E\\left(L\\right)/\\delta P=5.5.$$\n\nA pressure of 18 kbar increases E(I ) by 216 meV and raises the average energy of the lowest conduction-band state, determined from Eq. (3), by 66 meV, resulting in a net change of 150 meV in EcaM —Eca which should be sufficient to stabilize DX. This result is consistent with experimental results which show the appearance of DX centers in GaAs at pressures of about 20-30 kbar.\n\nIn the direct-gap region, the calculated pressure coefficient ~o(DX)/d, P of 8.4 meV/kbar is consistent with experimentally determined values from pressure-and temperature-dependent Hall measurements 6in GaAs and Alp i5Gaps5As. In the indirect-gap regime, the pressure coefficient &Fp(DX)/AP is calculated to be\n—5.2 meV/kbar. The change in sign of the pressure coeScient and its overall magnitude are consistent with recent experimental results of Li et al.\n\nWhile the dependence of the DX binding energy on al-loy composition or pressure does not allow us to infer its charge state, a comparison of the predicted and observed dopant-concentration dependence of the density of DX\ncenters in GaAs provides strong evidence for a negatively charged center. For high dopant densities where the donor electrons form a degenerate electron gas, the for-mation of DX centers may occur either via the reaction d +e DX for a negatively charged center, where e represents a free electron, or via do DXO if DX were a neutral center. As discussed below the second reaction is energetically very unfavorable. The probability that an electron has sufficient energy to form a DX center is given by [1+expP(EDx —EF)l ', where EF is the Fermi energy. At low temperatures, where P(EDx —EF)»1, the stabilization of DXO or DX, relative to free elec-trons at Ep, requires a rise in EF of 0.15 or 0.3 eV, re-spectively, relative to the CBM in GaAs. The variation of the DX concentration as a function of EF, and there-fore EDx EF, has—been determined by Theis, Mooney, and Wright. From their experiments they conclude that EDx lies =0.28 eV above the CBM in GaAs. This is within 7/o of the value expected from Eq. (11) for a negatively charged center and is significantly larger than the 0.15-eV value for a neutral center. A negatively charged DX center appears to be essential, therefore, in the reconciliation of the DX binding energy determined from the dopant-concentration measurements with those derived from the alloy-composition and pressure experi-ments. The problem of the pinning of the Fermi level in the conduction band by DX centers at high dopant concentrations is discussed in more detail elsewhere. ~3 We have carried out ab initio self-consistent calcula-tions for Si and S substitutional donors in GaAs to ex-amine in more detail the shallow-deep transition of donor levels in Al\"Ga~, As alloys. Optimal atomic coordi-nates were determined from an iterative energy-minimization approach using a three-dimen sion ally periodic eighteen-atom unit cell. Our calculations show that in GaAs a neutral donor is stable against Jahn-Teller distortions. The local phonon mode of the SiG,\nsubstitutional donor is calculated to be at =334 cm as compared to experimental values of 379-384 cm The mode is found to be very anharmonic and the use of lattice distortions smaller than the 0.1 A used in the cal-culations should improve the agreement between the theoretical and experimental values. For a negatively charged center, a metastable state with C3,, symmetry, which we associate with DX, is found. For a Si donor, the center involves a 1.17-A motion of the Si atom away from one of its nearest neighbors, along its bond axis, into a threefold-coordinated interstitial position. For a S\ndonor one of the nearest-neighbor Ga (or Al) atoms of the S dopant moves by 1.13 A into an interstitial site. A\ndonor-lattice bond is broken as a result of these atomic motions. The atomic distortions are nearly identical to those predicted to occur in the stable-to-metastable state transition of the EL2-related Aso, -antisite defect in GaAs\" The reaction represented by Eq. (1) is calculated to be energetically unfavorable by 0.22~0. 1 eV for both Si and S donors in GaAs. The surprisingly small value of the total-energy differences and the near equivalence of the results for Si and S are in qualitative agreement with the =0.3-eV estimate from Eq. (11) and the 0.28-eV\nvalue derived from dopant-concentration experiments.\n\nWhen the charge of the DX center is changed to DX\nor DX+, the interstitial atomic configuration is found to be highly unstable with respect to the ordinary fourfold-coordinated substitutional geometry and there is no bar-rier for the transformations to this geometry. The DX\nto do transition is calculated to be exothermic by =1.3 eV.\n\nOur calculations show that although the Si- and S-induced DX centers in GaAs are metastable, they have optically deep electronic levels associated with them.\n\nThe optical ionization energies are calculated to be 1.05 eV for GaAs:Si and 0.74 eV for GaAs:S. The optical ionization energies are predicted to increase with pres-sure or alloying in Al\"Ga~ \"As. In the composition range where the band gap is direct (i.e., x ~ 0.46), the optical gap is expected to vary as where the second term on the right-hand side represents the shift of the electronic level associated with DX. Sub-stitution of Eqs. (4) and (5) in Eq. (13) gives ~,pt 0.70x. The optical and thermal ionization energies are seen to have the same dependence on x and to be largest at x=0.46. The calculated results for GaAs together with Eq. (13) give an E,pt of 1.37 eV (1.06 eV) for Si-\n(S-) induced DX centers at x =0.46. Since DX is very unstable, the absorption of each photon by a DX center releases two electrons into the conduction band. For GaAs, our previous results on the pressure dependence of the conduction-band states used in conjunction with Eq.\n\n(13) predict, for GaAs:Si, a value of E,p&=1.34 eV for P 33 kbar, which is in good agreement with the experi-mental value of 1.44~0.04 of Li et al. At higher pres-sures E,p, is expected to decrease because the CBM\nchanges from I to X and the latter has a negative pres-sure coefficient.\n\nThe results of the pseudopotential calculations provide further insight into how the shallow-deep transition de-picted by Eq. (1) takes place. The calculations show that when a neutral Si donor atom is displaced away from its nearest neighbor along a bond axis, the total en-ergy increases as expected but the donor level becomes increasingly deeper as the displacement becomes larger.\n\nWhen the level has dropped by more than the on-site Coulombic repulsive term U, which is calculated to be\n=0.20-0.22 eV, the d level can capture a free electron without expelling it immediately back into the CBM. At this point the formation of a d center leads to a further motion of the Si atom which transforms it into a DX\ncenter. The energy barrier for electron capture E\"~ in lightly doped GaAs is calculated to be 0.55~0.05 eV\ncorresponding to the rise in energy for a 0.5-A displace-ment of the Si atom. The barrier is expected to decrease linearly with EF as the dopant concentration is in-creased. The Fermi level EF in highly doped samples ap-pears to get pinned at the point Eo(DX ) above the CBM where electrons at EF can combine with d centers, in the impurity band near the bottom of the con-duction band, to form DX centers. If d+ centers could be transformed to DX centers through the capture of two electrons, then EF would be pinned at ,\n'Eo(DX—)\nor 0.15 eV above the CBM instead of the much larger observed value of 0.28 eV. 9 In conclusion, from an analysis of experimental data on the composition, pressure, and dopant-concentration dependence of the DX binding energy in Al, Gai —\"As al-loys and from the results of ab initio pseudopotential cal-culations, we have presented evidence that DX is a nega-tively charged and highly localized defect center result-ing from a large lattice distortion. A more detailed dis-cussion of our results will be presented elsewhere.\n\nThis work is supported in part by the U.S. Office of Naval Research through Contract No. N00014-82-C-0244.\n\nD. V.

Introduction\n\nS\nINCE the study of indium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO) semiconductor in 2004, there have been numerous works focusing on amorphous oxide semiconductors (AOSs) as the active layer material of thin-film transistors (TFTs) [1], [2], [3], [4]. The merits of AOS TFTs include higher mobility, good transparency and flexibility, low-temperature processing capability, and suitability for large-scale manufacturing, which make it a promising candidate for future display devices.\n\nManuscript received 14 February 2023; revised 31 March 2023; accepted 24 April 2023.

The review of this article was arranged by Editor Y. Uraoka. *(Corresponding author: Miao Xu.)*\nJingdong Liu, Miao Xu, and Junbiao Peng are with the State Key Laboratory of Luminescent Materials and Devices, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510640, China (e-mail: eexumiao@\nscut.edu.cn).\n\nHua Xu and Min Li are with Guangzhou New Vision Optoelectronic Company Ltd., Guangzhou 510530, China.\n\nColor versions of one or more figures in this article are available at https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2023.3273511.\n\nDigital Object Identifier 10.1109/TED.2023.3273511 However, the stability issue of AOS has troubled the scientists for a long time, especially the negative gate bias illumination temperature stress [5], [6]. That is, a negative shift occurs in the threshold voltage (Vth) under conditions of visible light, heat, and electrical field stress.\n\nSeveral theories have been advanced to explain the origins of negative-bias-illumination-temperature stress stability\n(NBITS) instability, including oxygen-related defects [7], [8] and hydrogen impurities [9], [10]. It is commonly assumed that holes created by light-ionization in deep subgap states above the valence band maximums (VBMs) are trapped at the channel/dielectric interface, while free electrons are injected into the conduction band, thus resulting in photo-instability of the device. Reducing hydrogen impurities and oxygen vacancies (VOs) (thought to be key sources of free electrons)\nis effective, but there are still lots of difficulties remaining.\n\nAs for hydrogen impurities, which could be an essential donor, they are easily brought into the channel during the deposition process at a concentration of 1020 cm−3 unless deposited in an ultrahigh vacuum environment [11]. To inhibit the formation of oxygen vacancies, doping metal elements [12], [13] with strong bonding and posttreatment [14], [15] are effective methods. However, oxygen vacancy is an intrinsic defect of AOS\nthat is difficult to totally eliminate. Those defects can also be minimized by insulator modification and passivation matching [16]. However, these techniques either impair performance or raise costs. Due to the abovementioned inevitabilities, it is necessary to redesign the channel's material to improve light stability. A trap-assisted model has recently been developed\n[17]. The doping element lanthanide praseodymium (Pr) is employed to capture photo-generated electrons ionized from deep-level oxygen vacancies, thus resulting in highly lightstable TFTs. For improving the stability of TFT devices and clarifying the mechanism of the trap-assisted model, the role of lanthanide rare Earth elements needs further study.\n\nIn this article, we report a method of doping lanthanide into AOS to improve light stability and investigate the physical nature of it. Indium-zinc-oxide (IZO) (In:Zn = 2:1) was chosen as the channel because of its excellent electrical performance while suffering from serious instability under 0018-9383 © 2023 IEEE.

Terbium (Tb), a lanthanide element, was chosen as a dopant due to its similar electronic structure to Pr (4f orbital) and valence state (trivalent and tetravalent)\n[18]. Different Tb concentrations of doped IZO (Tb-IZO) films and TFTs were successfully fabricated using a co-sputtering method, and the mechanism of the effect of Tb on AOS was studied. Our research contributes to a better knowledge of the effect of lanthanide elements on metal oxides, especially in terms of light stability, which is essential for the future production of high-performance TFTs.\n\n## Ii. Experiments\n\nA bottom-gate staggered structure was employed in this study. A gate metal (Mo, 200 nm) and stacked gate insulator\n(SiO2/Si3N4, 50/250 nm) were recycled by dc sputtering and plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). For the channel deposition, the Tb-IZO (30 nm) thin films with different Tb concentrations (0/1.51/3.21/4.72/6.21 at.%) were deposited using the RF magnetron co-sputtering system by changing the plasma power of each target of IZO and Tb-IZO\n(Tb concentration = 6.21 at.%). Both the ceramic targets of IZO and Tb-IZO were used and sintered with a purity of 99.99%. The films were raised using Ar and O2 mixing gas\n(Ar/O2 = 9:1) at 5 mTorr and patterned by a wet etching process. Then, a 200-nm-thick SiO2 layer was grown by PECVD serving as the etch stop layer (ESL) and patterned by dry etching. Mo source (S)/drain (D) electrodes (200 nm thick)\nwere formed by dc sputtering and patterned by wet etching.\n\nAfter that, 200-nm-thick SiO2 as passivation was grown by PECVD. Finally, the annealed TFTs were annealed at 300 ◦C\nin air for 30 min.\n\nThe device characterization was carried out using a probe station and an Agilent B1500A semiconductor parameter analyzer. The length (L) and width (W) of the channel were 10 and 20 µm, respectively. The transfer curves were measured at a drain bias of 10.1 V, and the Vth was determined from the VGS at IDS of L/W × 10−9 A. The electrical stress was applied at a VGS of −20 V and a VDS of 0 V for 3600 s. The illumination was applied using a commercialized LED light unit with a brightness of 12 000 cd/m2. All measurements were carried out under ambient conditions at room temperature. The transmittance of various Tb-IZO thin films on quartz substrates was measured by UV−VIS spectroscopy (UV-3600, Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan). Chemical compositions were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250i). The photoconductivity responses were investigated using a microwave photoconductivity decay (Micro-PCD) measurement system (LTA-1620SP).\n\n## Iii. Results And Discussion\n\nFig. 1(a) shows the results of a Hall measurement to evaluate the carrier density and hall mobility of IZO thin films with varying Tb concentrations. Carrier concentrations decreased from 4.6 × 1019 to 3.6 × 1019 cm−3as Tb increased, and hall mobility dropped from 29.9 to 14.7 cm2/V·s. According to the percolation theory for AOS [19], the decrease in carrier concentration leads to a downward shift of the Fermi energy\n\n![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)\n\n![1_image_1.png](1_image_1.png)\n\nlevel. As for n-type oxide semiconductors, free carriers mainly come from donors such as oxygen vacancies. It is probable that decreased oxygen vacancy after Tb doping is correlated with stronger bonding energy of Tb-O (694 kJ/mol) compared to In-O (360 kJ/mol) and Zn-O (284.1 kJ/mol). It partially explains both the carrier concentration and field-effect mobility dropping at the same time. Nevertheless, decreased mobility is often related to a rise in defects in shallow energy levels. These acceptor-like states have the ability to capture free electrons in the conduction band, thus leading to a drop in mobility.\n\nTo explore the effect of Tb on band gap, transmittance data were acquired by a double-beam spectrophotometer at wavelengths ranging from 300 to 1100 nm. The light absorption coefficient (α) can be calculated according to the following equation [20]:\n\n$$\\alpha=\\frac{1}{d}\\ln\\biggl{(}\\frac{1-R}{T}\\biggr{)}.\\tag{1}$$  **Note $\\alpha$ for $T$ and $\\alpha$ are close to the \nThe Eg can be extracted from Tauc plot according to the following formula [21]:\n\n$$\\left(\\alpha\\mathrm{h}v\\right)^{2}=A\\left(\\mathrm{h}v-E_{g}\\right)$$\n$\\eqref{eq:walpha}$. \n\n(2)\nwhere hν is the incident photon energy, Eg is the optical band gap of the film, and A is a constant. As shown in Fig. 1(b), the Eg is calculated by the intersection of the linear fitting curves and the hν-axis. It is observed that Tb doping slightly affects the band gap, about 3.08 and 3.15 eV for IZO and Tb-IZO (6.31%) films, respectively.\n\nXPS was employed to investigate the composition, chemical state, and valence band of the Tb-IZO thin films.\n\nThe impact on the Tb to O 1 s spectra is shown in Fig. 2(a).\n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)\n\nFig. 2(b) and (c) shows the core energy of O 1 s of the IZO films without and with Tb doping. O 1 s peak is fit by two Gaussian distributions with binding energies of 529.5 and 530.5 eV, which correspond to the oxygen in oxide lattices (denoted as O-M) and oxygen vacancy (denoted as O-Vacancy), respectively. VO content monotonously decreased from 29.6% to 23.7% after Tb doping. Fewer oxygen vacancies suggest fewer donors, thus validating the observation in hall measurement that carrier concentration declines as a result of Tb. As shown in Fig. 2(d), the peak of Tb 4d is fit by four Gaussian distributions [22]. The ratio of trivalent and tetravalent is maintained at 0.9/1 for different Tb concentrations. The black peak is assigned to Tb4+, and the green peak is Tb3+ [23]. Additionally, the valence band spectra of the Tb-IZO thin films are summarized in Fig. 2(e).\n\nAs Tb increases, the quantity of generated subgap states also increases. The increased subgap states are above the valence band, and this position is likely to be the oxygen vacancy or defects associated with Tb. Given the decrease in oxygen vacancy reported in Fig. 2(c), it is believed that the enlarged subgap states are Tb-induced defects.\n\nThe Micro-PCD method is a nondestructive and contactless technique that uses laser irradiation to increase the conductivity of semiconductor thin films, which changes microwave reflectivity [24], [25]. Evaluate the film quality in terms of defect density and crystalline irregularity using the signal curve generated by the trapping and recombination processes of photo-generated carriers. Fig. 3(a) presents the reflective signal curve of Tb-IZO films with various Tb contents.\n\nExtracted peak value, slow decay time, and D value are summarized in Fig. 3(b). The peak reflectivity signal is the greatest signal of survived photo-generated carriers, which reflects the density of the conduction band tail states [25],\ni.e., fewer photo-generated free carriers survived, thus implying that more recombination or trapping occurs during laser pulse irradiation. Since subgap states in semiconductor films can reduce the number of electrons that make it into the conduction band through trapping and recombination, it is thought that the peak is related to the mobility [26]. It is observed that as Tb increased, the peak value dropped sharply.\n\nPure IZO film exhibited a peak value of up to 1880 mV. When the Tb increases to 6.31%, the peak value drops to merely 400 mV. Clearly, the light response of semiconductors has been efficiently suppressed by Tb. Tb doping generates a large number of subgap states. The decay process is divided into two processes: fast decay and slow decay. The fast decay represents the fast recombination process of photo-generated electrons and is related to the recombination process through deep-level states. Note that the lifetime of fast decay is very short, so it is difficult to observe directly. When the pulsewidth of the laser is large enough compared with its lifetime, the peak value is proportional to the lifetime of fast decay. The slow decay is caused by the remitted electrons being captured by trap states below the conduction band minimums (CBM) about 0.2 eV [24]. The lifetime of the slow decay is denoted as τ2. The D value is extracted from the inverse of the slope of the slow decay and is attributed to the density of local states below CBM. A slower decay time signifies an increase in the shallow defects that act as the recombination center.\n\nWith Tb content increasing, τ2 experienced a rapid rise from 1.72 to 4.72 µs and the D value monotonically decreased from 0.85 to 0.31. The above results infer that Tb can increase the electron traps in the shallow energy levels and capture the photo-generated electrons in the conduction band back to the ground state through a recombination process.\n\nThe transfer characteristics of Tb-IZO-TFTs (W/L =\n20/10 µm) as a function of Tb ratio ([Tb]/[Tb + In + Zn]) are shown in Fig. 4(a). The saturation mobility (µsat) is extracted using saturation-mode gradual channel approximation, and the Vth is determined by the gate voltage (VGS), which induces a drain current of L/W × 1 nA at a VDS of 10.1 V. The subthreshold slope (SS) is extracted from the liner part of the plot log (IDS) versus VGS. The performance parameters of all the devices are summarized in Table I. The IZO TFT exhibited a µsat of 25.7 cm2/V·s, SS of 0.20 V/decade, and Vth of −0.4 V.\n\nThe transfer characteristics were strongly dependent on the amount of Tb. First, the Vth value was positively shifted with increasing Tb (from −0.4 to 3.2 V). The positive shifts of Vth indicate a reduction in carrier density in the channel, which consists of the observation in the hall measurement.\n\nThe values of µsat and SS corresponding to Tb-IZO TFTs with different Tb concentrations are illustrated in Fig. 4(b). As Tb increased, SS decreased monotonically from 0.20 to 0.72 and µsat deteriorated from 25.7 to 12.2 cm2/V·s. SS is related to trap states in the device.

N SS and D H are summarized in Table I. The Nss and D it values for undoped device are 1.75 × 10 17 and 3.49 × 10 11 cm − 3 , respectively. These values monotonically increase to 6.25 × 10 17 and 1.25 × 10 12 cm −\nwhen the Tb ratio increases to 6.31 at%. Since electron transport is controlled by the localized states below CBM, it is natural that an increase in trap states would result in a decrease in mobility. Our theory is supported by the characteristic curve of Tb-IZO TFTs, which confirms that Tb plays a significant role in the formation of acceptor-like states below CBM.\n\nTo further certificate the role of Tb, transfer curves of Tb-IZO TFT with different Tb concentrations at varied temperatures were carried out, as shown in Fig. 4(c) and (d) .\n\nFalling rate (FR)31 of active energy in the threshold region is an effective factor to evaluate the trap state above the Fermi level. The relationship between active energy and V G versus different temperatures can be expressed as [ 27 ]\n(4)\n\n## I Ds = Α(V G − V Th ) E − Ibi\n\nwhere IDS is the drain current, and kB is Boltzmann's constant. The slower the rate of activation energy declines, the more severe the pinning effect on Fermi level. And density of states (DOS) of shallow energy level can be calculated by FRs, and acquired data are summarized in Fig. 4(e) . As Tb increased, FRs decreased from 0.51 to 0.08 eV/V, which confirmed the fact that shallow defects are growing rapidly.\n\nSimilar to the previous N ss results, the DOS of the doped device increased after doping (6.31 at% Tb) from 1.18 × 10 16 to 7.54 × 10 16 cm − 3 .\n\nTo investigate the effect of light illumination on the electric properties of Tb-IZO-TFTs, the characterization of photo response was carried out using a white LED lamp.\n\nThe photo-response of IZO and Tb-IZO TFTs is shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b) . The photo-response of IZO TFTs has been extremely inhibited by Tb doping. The NBITS tests are carried out at V GS = − 20 V and V DS = 0 V, and temperature at 298 K.\n\nA commercialized LED is irradiated on top of the device with\n\n![3_image_0.png](3_image_0.png)\n\nwhite light, and the light is not turned off while sampling the transfer characteristic. The NBITS stability of IZO TFTs with or without Tb (6.31%) is shown in Fig. 5(c) and (d) . NBITS stability has been greatly improved ( ∆ V th was reduced from − 4.1 to − 0.6 V). The negative drift of the V th is due to the injection of photo-generated holes at the interface; thus, the charge trap model is used to evaluate the NBITS\nstability. The stretched-exponential equation for the AV th is defined as [ 28 ]\n\n$$\\Delta V_{\\rm th}=\\Delta V_{\\rm th0}\\Biggl{[}1-\\exp\\Biggl{\\{}-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\Biggr{\\}}^{\\beta}\\Biggr{]}\\tag{5}$$\n\nwhere ∆ V th 0 is the ∆ V th at infinite time, t is the stress time, τ represents the characteristic trapping time of carriers, and β is the stretched-exponential exponent correlated with the energy barrier. Fig. 5(e) shows that the stress time dependence of ∆ V th is well fi t by the stretched exponential equation upon factor. After Tb doping, the maximum ∆ V th 0 dropped from\n− 15.10 to − 0.57 V. In general, decreased shift of V th0 implies that the injection barrier will be higher ( β  will be smaller) and the trapping time τ required to reach ∆ V th 0 will be longer.\n\nHowever, our results show an increase in β (from 0.43 to 0.72) and a decrease in τ (from 5.26 × 10 4 to 1.50 × 10 3 s)\nafter Tb doping, which points out that there is an alternative explanation. With the classical V O model, when the incident light energy exceeds 2.3 eV, photo-generated carriers will be excited from neutral V O and VBMs. Furthermore, under negative bias, the photo-generated holes would be trapped at Authorized licensed use limited to: Peking University.

Meanwhile, the band gap of Tb-IZO films with different compositions is almost unchanged. These results suggest that the enhanced NBITS stability in Tb-IZO TFTs must be due to other reasons.\n\nAs discussed in the Micro-PCD test, the peak value decreases gradually with the increasing of doping content, and the variation of D value indicates that amounts of localized states exist at a shallow level about 0.2 eV below CBM with Tb doping. Meanwhile, as shown in Table I, the deceasing of mobility and the degradation of SS suggested amounts of shallow acceptor-like trap states were introduced near the CBM in Tb-IZO TFTs. By calculation of FRs, it is also implied that amounts of acceptor-like trap states will be formed by Tb doping (about 1017 cm−3·eV−1 with 6.31% Tb content). The results of light response tests show the drastic suppression of free electrons in Tb-IZO TFTs, which should be attributed to the neutralization of photo-generated carriers caused by the shallow acceptor-like trap states. On the other hand, in the XPS test, the simultaneous existence of Tb trivalent and tetravalent was confirmed. It can be speculated that Tb-related shallow trap states (Tb4+) could become recombination centers which provides an effective path to neutralize the photo-generated carriers (the trap-assisted recombination process) [29], [30].\n\nA subgap model, as illustrated in Fig. 6, is suggested to clarify the mechanism of improved NBITS stability by introducing Tb doping. Under light irradiation, free electrons would be excited from oxygen vacancy-related deep state and VBM,\nand the neutralization of ionized oxygen vacancy and bandto-band absorption makes photo-generated holes in VBM. The holes would be trapped at or into the gate insulator, thus resulting in a severe negative shift of Vth in the undoped TFT.\n\nHowever, in Tb-IZO cases, the photo-generated electrons in CBM tend to be trapped by the shallow acceptor-like trap states (Tb4+). In other words, the process of charge transfer between In 5 s orbits to Tb 4f orbits is fast enough, thus resulting in the suppressed photo-generated current. Then, the Tb 4f orbits charged with the photo-generated electrons would lower the energy (Tb4+ → Tb3+), which is close to oxygen vacancy-related deep trap states above the VBM. Finally, the electron–hole recombination between Tb3+ and Vn+\nO would provide a fast way to neutralize holes in VBM, thus leading to a significant reduction of trapped positive charge at or into the gate insulator under negative bias. The trap-assisted recombination process could also explain the abnormal variation of β and τ in the stretched-exponential model fitting in the NBITS\ntest. It could be reasonably speculated that the Tb doping hardly changes the distribution of the injection barrier height at the interface between the active layer and the insulator.\n\nHowever, the significant decreases in photo-generated holes in VBM lead to a decrease in characteristic barrier height because the positive charges are apt to be injected into the trap states with lower energy barriers. The lower barrier height indicates easier and faster injection process, thus resulting larger β and shorter τ with Tb doping during the analysis of NBITS results.\n\nThe results of Tb-IZO films and TFTs are strong evidence for confirming the trap-assisted model originally brought by Pr doping. It is concluded that Pr and Tb (due to Ln4+/Ln3+\nconversion) are effective in improving NBITS stability among all the lanthanide element. The further comparison of these two elements is in progress, which is meaningful for further interpretation of the trap-assisted model but will be discussed here.\n\n## Iv. Conclusion\n\nIn summary, a promising metal–oxide–semiconductor channel material with Tb doping is presented. Tb-IZO TFTs have been fabricated and systematically investigated. Compared with the pristine IZO TFT, Tb-IZO exhibits excellent NBITS\nstability (1Vth decreased from −4.1 to −0.6 V in 3600 s).\n\nThe enhanced stability after Tb doping can be attributed to the generation of Tb-related defects near the CBM, which acts as the recombination center for photo-generated electrons and V\nn+\nO\n. This study discloses that the trap-assisted nonirradiation recovery model induced by Tb doping is the main mechanism that suppresses the negative shifts of Vth during NIBTS tests, which is crucial for fabricating highly stable TFT devices.\n\nREFERENCES\n[1] K.

Van de Walle Materials Department, University of California, Santa Barbara, California 93106-5050 Received 22 March 2005; accepted 28 July 2005; published online 14 September 2005-\nThe electronic properties of ZnO have traditionally been explained by invoking intrinsic defects. In particular, the frequently observed unintentional n-type conductivity has often been attributed to oxygen vacancies. We report first-principles calculations showing that the oxygen vacancy VO is not a shallow donor, but has a deep 2+/0- level at 1.0 eV below the conduction band. The negative-U behavior that causes the 1+charge state to be unstable is associated with large local lattice relaxations. We present a detailed configuration coordinate diagram, which allows us to provide a detailed interpretation of recently reported ODEPR optically detected electron paramagnetic resonance- measurements L. S. Vlasenko and G. D. Watkins, Phys. Rev. B 71, 125210 2005-.\n\n© *2005 American Institute of Physics*. DOI: 10.1063/1.2053360 Zinc oxide is a wide-band-gap semiconductor with numerous applications, for instance in varistors, phosphors, and sensors. Recent progress in crystal growth has also opened up prospects for optoelectronic devices. Such applications are currently hampered, however, by the lack of control over conductivity. ZnO is typically n-type, and high-resistivity material has been difficult to obtain; p-type doping has been reported,1,2 but reliability and reproducibility are serious issues. Understanding the source of unintentional conductivity is a crucial step towards control of doping. The accepted wisdom is that the unintentional n-type conductivity is due to native point defects.3 Oxygen vacancies have been most widely discussed, but most of the arguments have been based on circumstantial evidence, in the absence of unambiguous experimental observations.\n\nRecent computational studies4–7 have cast doubt on the categorization of the oxygen vacancy VO- as a shallow donor. However, the reported electronic levels display wide discrepancies. In this Letter we present a comprehensive theoretical study which not only provides more reliable electronic levels for the defect, but also addresses the unusually large atomic relaxations that occur in its various charge states. These result in the 1+ charge state being thermodynamically unstable, i.e., VO behaves as a \"negative-U\" center. Since the 1+ charge state is paramagnetic with VO\n+ containing an unpaired electron- this instability has important repercussions for observations of VO based on electron paramagnetic resonance EPR-: no EPR signal should be observed in equilibrium, and an excitation process illumination- is necessary to produce the paramagnetic state. Our calculated formation energies indicate that VO is too high in energy to play any significant role in as-grown n-type material. However, it is expected to act as a compensating center in p-type ZnO and it can also be formed during irradiation and ion implantation. Our calculated configuration coordinate diagram allows a consistent interpretation of recent experiments by Vlasenko and Watkins8 which have provided the most detailed information to date about EPR and optical transitions associated with VO.\n\nOur investigation is based on state-of-the-art firstprinciples calculations using density-functional theory, pseudopotentials, and plane-wave expansions of wave functions and potentials.9,10 A supercell geometry with 96 atoms in the cell was employed, and a 2-2-2 mesh of special k-points for integrations over the Brillouin zone. All of our calculations are carried out at the theoretical equilibrium lattice constants,11 which is essential in order to avoid spurious effects when calculating relaxations. We derive the formation energy Ef, which determines the likelihood for a defect to form during growth. The formation energy of a native defect D in charge state q is defined as12\n\n## Efdq- = Etotdq- − Etotzno- + Nznzn + Noo + Qef. 1-\n\nEtotDq- is the total energy of the supercell containing the defect D in the charge state q, and EtotZnO- is the total energy of the ZnO perfect crystal in the same supercell. The Fermi energy EF which will be referenced to the top of the valence band Ev- enters because the defect can occur in various charge states, and the electrons that are removed from the defect need to be placed in their reservoir, with energy EF. Zn and O are the chemical potentials of Zn and O, i.e.,\nthe energies of the reservoirs with which Zn and O atoms are exchanged. For displaying our results below, we choose Znrich conditions Zn=Znsolid-, the most extreme case for favoring formation of oxygen vacancies.\n\nFrom the formation energies EfDq- we can calculate transition levels q/q-.\n\n12 Since the local density approximation LDA- severely underestimates band gaps, a correction is necessary to compare the calculated q/q- with experiment. We base the correction on calculations performed using the LDA on the one hand, and the \"LDA+U\"\napproach13 on the other hand. The idea of the LDA+U\nmethod is to separate electrons into two subsystems: localized d electrons for which the strong Coulomb repulsion U\nshould be taken into account via a Hubbard-like term in a model Hamiltonian, and delocalized electrons which can be described by an orbital-independent one-electron potential.\n\nThe LDA+U approach lowers the energy of the Zn d states, thus reducing their repulsion with the O p states at the top of the valence band, and increasing the band gap.11 The LDA\n+U thus provides a partial but physically important correction of the band gap, the remaining correction arising from the intrinsic LDA error see Table I-. However, we can use the LDA and LDA+U results to extrapolate to the experimental gap. Indeed, the shift of the transition level is determined by its relative amount of valence-band versus conduction-band character, and this information is contained in the shift of q/q- between LDA and LDA+U. Table I\nTABLE I. Calculated band gaps and transition levels q/q- for oxygen vacancies in ZnO in eV-.

This is to be expected, since the VO defect states are composed of dangling bonds on the neighboring Zn atoms, which exhibit mainly conduction-band character. The extrapolated values for the transition levels are also very close to results obtained using self-interaction-corrected pseudopotentials,15 enhancing confidence in the approach.\n\nFigure 1a- shows the formation energy of the oxygen vacancy VO as a function of Fermi level EF for the three possible charge states VO\n0 , VO\n+ , and VO\n2+, corrected according to the procedure described above. Under p-type conditions, where EF is near the top of the valence band, the oxygen vacancy is stable in the VO\n2+ charge state and therefore acts as a compensating center with low formation energy. Under n-type conditions, however, where EF is near the bottom of the conduction band, the oxygen vacancy is in the neutral charge state. The calculated 2+/0- transition level is located deep in the band gap, at 1.0 eV below the bottom of the conduction band, indicating that VO will not provide electrons to the conduction band at room temperature. In addition, the formation energy of VO under n-type conditions is very high 3.5 eV-, indicating that it is unlikely to form even at high temperatures during growth. We conclude that oxygen vacancies are not the source of unintentional n-type conductivity.\n\nFigure 1a- also shows that the 1+ charge state is not stable: the formation energy of VO\n+ is higher than that of VO\n0\n\n![2_image_1.png](2_image_1.png)\n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)\n\n$$(2)$$\n\nand VO\n2+ for all values of EF. This is related to the fact that the 2+/+- transition level is located higher in the gap than the\n+/0- level, an unusual ordering based on the expected Coulomb repulsion that occurs when electrons are added to a defect. Since the 1+charge state is not stable in equilibrium, any EPR measurements claiming to identify VO without providing any excitation should be treated with suspicion. In fact, those papers systematically claim to identify VO based on a line with g1.96. In reality, VO corresponds to a line with g1.99, and the reports16,17 that correctly make this identification have in common that 1- electron irradition was used to produce the defect since, in agreement with our calculations, the starting n-type material contains only a negligible concentration of VO- and 2- optical excitation was found to be necessary to observe the EPR signal, in agreement with the calculated metastability of VO\n+ .\n\nThe effective correlation energy U no relation to the parameter in the LDA+U approach above- is defined as the difference between the relevant transition levels, i.e.,\nU=+/0-−2+/+-=EfVO\n2+-+EfVO\n0-− 2EfVO\n+-. Our calculations yield +/0-= 1.9 eV and 2+/+-= 2.9 eV,\nand, hence, U=−1.0 eV. The negative value reflects the fact that atomic relaxations play a major role in stabilizing particular charge states. Our calculations indeed show that the lattice relaxations around VO are large and very different in different charge states. For VO\n0 , the four Zn nearest neighbors are displaced *inward* by 12% of the equilibrium Zn–O bond length, whereas for VO\n+ and VO\n2+ the displacements are *outward* by +2% and +23%, as shown in Fig. 2. Note that the symmetry of the wurtzite structure does not impose that the relaxations of all four Zn atoms are identical; however, we find that to a good approximation the Zn atom along the c axis relaxes by the same amount as the other three Zn neighbors to within 0.01Å-, and the magnitude of this breathing relaxation is very similar to that obtained from calculations for the zinc-blende structure.\n\nThe origin of these large lattice relaxations lies in the electronic structure of VO. The removal of an oxygen atom from a perfect ZnO crystal leaves four Zn dangling bonds, each contributing 1/ 2 electron to a neutral vacancy. The interaction of these dangling bonds results in a completely symmetric a1 state which lies in the band gap- and three almost degenerate higher energy states resonant in the conduction band-. For VO\n0 , the a1 state is occupied by two electrons, and its energy is lowered when the four Zn atoms approach each other, with the gain in electronic energy exceeding the cost to stretch the Zn–O bonds surrounding the vacancy. The resulting a1 state identified by the Kohn–Sham level in our calculated band structures- lies near the top of the valence band see Fig. 2-. In the VO\n+ configuration, the a1 state is occupied by one electron, and the electronic energy gain is too small to overcome the strain energy; the four Zn atoms are displaced slightly outward, moving the a1 state near the middle of the gap. In the VO\n2+ configuration, the a1 state is unoccupied and the four Zn atoms strongly relax outward, assuming almost planar configurations with respect to their oxygen neighbors. This relaxation strengthens the Zn–O bonds, and the empty a1 state lies near the bottom of the conduction band. This large relaxation significantly reduces the formation energy of VO\n2+ with respect to VO\n+ , making the oxygen vacancy a negative-U center.\n\nOne may wonder why the transition levels associated with the anion vacancy in ZnO lie so much higher in the band gap than the levels associated with, for instance, the selenium vacancy in ZnSe,18 since in both cases the electronic states have mainly Zn dangling bond character. In fact, the positioning of the levels is consistent provided one takes the alignment of band structures on an absolute energy scale into account see Fig. 1b-. The large difference in energetic position of the anion p states that determine the valence-band maximum O 2p versus Se 4p- causes a large valence-band offset between ZnSe and ZnO.19 Given this large discontinuity, it should be no surprise that Zn-related states occur at very different relative positions in the band gap.\n\nThe large difference in the local lattice relaxations of VO\n2+, VO\n+ , and VO\n0 leads to large Stokes shifts in the optical spectra according to the Franck-Condon principle. Figure 3 shows our calculated configuration coordinate cc- diagram, obtained by calculating the formation energy in the different charge states for a series of atomic positions across the range of relaxations. Figure 3a- shows that the peak in the light excitation spectrum of VO\n0 →VO\n+ is predicted to occur at 2.0 eV, in reasonable agreement with the measured value of 2.3 eV 530 nm-.\n\n17,20 The calculated emission is predicted to occur at 0.7 eV, corresponding to a Stokes shift as large as 1.3 eV. Excitation of the center to the +1 charge state may lead to persistent photoconductivity. The calculated thermal barrier to escape out of the +1 charge state back to the ground state is 0.30 eV. Therefore persistent photoconductivity as well as a persistence of the VO\n+ EPR signal after the exciting light is turned off- is expected to be observed only at low temperatures.\n\nFinally, we turn to an interpretation of recent experiments by Vlasenko and Watkins using optical detection of electron paramagnetic resonance ODEPR- in electron irradiated ZnO.8 They observe a spin-dependent process:\n\n![3_image_0.png](3_image_0.png)\n\n## Em0 + Vo + → Em+ + Vo\n\n0 , 3corresponding to signals in a broad photoluminescence PL-\nband which is centered at 600 nm 2.07 eV- and has a zerophonon line around 500 nm 2.48 eV- . The authors propose two possible models. In the first, the +/0- transition level is placed at 0.9 eV above the top of the valence band, and the luminescence results from the transfer of an electron from an effective-mass donor EM- to the vacancy, i.e., the spindependent process is the luminescence process itself. In the second model, the +/0- transition level is placed at 2.48 eV\nabove the top of the valence band and the luminescence results from hole capture by the neutral vacancy.\n\nOur computational results strongly favor the second model. Indeed, the cc diagram of Fig. 3b- indicates a zerophonon line transition from VO\n0 to VO\n+ at 2.0 eV, with an emission band centered at 1.5 eV. Furthermore, Fig. 3ashows that the spin-dependent electron-capture process in Eq. 3- is predicted to produce luminescence at 0.7 eV\nand, indeed, the PL spectra in Ref. 8 show a weak broad band centered around 1500 nm 0.8 eV-.\n\nIn summary, we have shown that the oxygen vacancy is a deep donor in ZnO with the 2+/0- transition level at 1.0 eV below the bottom of the conduction band. Therefore, VO is not responsible for the unintentional n-type conductivity often observed in as-grown ZnO, although it may act as a compensating center in p-type ZnO. Our calculated configuration coordinate diagram provides a consistent interpretation of recent ODEPR measurements.8 The authors would like to express our gratitude to Professor G. D.

The VBT states are at least partly characterized by the O–O pps- molecular orbital, and the localized-hole-mediated lattice instability results in the formation of the peroxide defects. Along with the O–O bond formation, the pps- state is heightened up into the conduction bands, and two electrons are accordingly doped in the electronic ground state. The energy barrier from the O2 2 peroxide state to the normal disorder state is found to be 0.97 eV in hybrid density functional theory. The hole-mediated formation of the meta-stable peroxide defects and their metastability is suggested as an origin of the negative bias and/or illumination stress instability in AOS.\n\n 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim 1 Introduction The limit of carrier mobility of amorphous Si makes it challenging to apply the amorphous Si-based thin film transistors (TFTs) to next-generation flat panel displays, and the -amorphous oxide semiconductors\n(AOS), which have about 10 times larger electron mobility, have attracted great attention as a material to replace the amorphous Si [1, 2]. The AOS material is not only suitable for low temperature processing but also visible-light transparent and flexible [3, 4]. Thus, extensive studies on the AOS materials and TFTs have been made to understand the material and device properties including a variety of puzzling phenomena and realize the display applications\n[1–4]. However, there is a critical unsolved problem of the negative bias and/or illumination stress instability.\n\nThe material and device properties, such as conductivity and threshold voltage (Vth), are significantly changed and recovered at a very slow rate after the stress [5–16]. This instability problem is now a critical obstacle to fabricating reliable AOS-based devices.\n\nThere has been considerable effort to resolve the negative bias and/or illumination stress instability of AOS. (i) Holes are generated by light illumination and trapped at the interface between the AOS channel and the gate insulator and/or injected into the gate insulator [8, 14]. (ii) Surface O atoms are desorbed (reduction) and accordingly electrons dope [7]. (iii) Photo-ionized O-vacancies (VO)\npersist with slow electron recombination [9–14, 17, 18].\n\nAlthough the gate insulator hole trap model (i) can be one of the instability mechanisms, the instability has been observed not only in AOS TFTs but also in AOS thin films without a gate insulator through persistent photo-conductivity (PPC) [14, 19]. Thus, there has been considered to be an intrinsic mechanism in AOS materials [12, 14]. According to the surface O reduction model (ii), an overlying passivation layer on the AOS TFTs has been adopted [7], but the instability has been still serious even avoiding the surface effect [8–10, 12]. The VO (iii) can give photo-carriers and be a hole-trap [9–14, 17, 18], but the meta-stability of the ionized VO remains unclear. In order to explain the long recovery time of Vth in AOS TFTs [9, 14–16] and the long PPC of AOS [14, 19] (an order of day at room temperature), the energy barrier from the meta-stable state to the stable state should be very high. Experimentally reported activation energy is in the range of 0.9–1.0 eV [19].\n\n1278 H.-H. Nahm et al.: Instability of amorphous oxide semiconductors via transition to peroxide state physica p status s **solidi**sb\n\n![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)\n\nIn this work, we show that the carrier-mediated structural transition between the normal disorder and the O2 2 peroxide state (PS) leads to the negative bias and/or illumination stress instability of AOS. With excited holes in the valence band tail (VBT) states, the empty pps--like VBT states induce a driving force to form an O–O bond through the pps-hybridization. The pps- state is heightened up into the conduction bands along with the O–O bond formation, and in the electronic ground state the two electrons occupy the conduction band minimum (CBM) state. The O2 2 PS is found to be meta-stable, and the energy barrier from the PS to the normal disorder state (DS) is calculated to be 0.97 eV.\n\n2 Methodology The density-functional theory\n(DFT) calculations were performed as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) code [20, 21].\n\nThe projector-augmented wave (PAW) pseudopotentials\n[22] and the plane-wave basis set with a kinetic energy cutoff of 400 eV were used. The local-density approximation\n(LDA) [23] with the on-site Coulomb energy (U) of 6 eV for the In, Ga, and Zn d states [24] (LDA þ U) was mainly used for the exchange correlation energy. The Heyd–\nScuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE) hybrid functional [25, 26]\nwas also used with the standard mixing parameter of 0.25 (25% from Hartree–Fock) and the screening parameter fixed to 0.2 A˚ 1. The LDA þ U band gap of the amorphous InGaZnO4 is 0.97 eV, and the HSE band gap is 2.55 eV\nsimilarly to the other HSE calculations [27]. The HSE value is more close to the experimental (optical) band gap of 3.17 eV [28]. There were only quantitative differences between the LDA þ U and HSE calculations.\n\nWe mainly investigated amorphous InGaZnO4, which is a representative AOS, and In2Ga2ZnO7, In2Sn2Zn2O9, and In2Sn6Zn12O27 AOS's were also studied [29]. The 168atomic cubic supercell was used for the InGaZnO4 (Fig. 1a),\nand the 144-, 180-, and 141-atomic cubic supercells were used for the In2Ga2ZnO7, In2Sn2Zn2O9, and In2Sn6Zn12O27, respectively. The average volumes per unit formula of the AOS's were derived from the experimental mass densities of In2O3 (7180 kg/m3), Ga2O3 (6000 kg/m3),\nSnO2 (6900 kg/m3), and ZnO (5600 kg/m3). The unit lengths of the cubic supercells are 12.542 (InGaZnO4),\n11.895 (In2Ga2ZnO7), 13.047 (In2Sn2Zn2O9), and 11.970 A˚\n\n![1_image_2.png](1_image_2.png)\n\n![1_image_1.png](1_image_1.png)\n\n(In2Sn6Zn12O27). For InGaZnO4, the amorphous phase is 9.6% larger in average volume per unit formula than the crystalline phase. The orthorhombic and rhombohedral supercells were also tested for the amorphous InGaZnO4.\n\nThe 168- and 112-atomic supercells were used, respectively\n(Fig. 1b and c). No meaningful differences were found between the cubic, orthorhombic, and rhombohedral supercells.\n\nA single k-point at (0.25, 0.25, and 0.25) in the cubic Brillouin zone (BZ) was used in most calculations for the BZ integration. The total energy difference between the single k-point and the 2  2  2 Monkhorst–Pack mesh is only a few meV. In b evaluation (will be defined below),\nwe used the G point to describe the electrons occupying the CBM state. In a (will be defined below) and relative stabilities, the energy differences between the (0.25, 0.25, and 0.25) and G point calculations are only <10 meV.\n\nThe amorphous structures were generated by the melt-and-quenching molecular dynamics simulations within the Nose´ canonical ensemble. A random AOS\nstructure was melted at 3000 K for 6 ps and then quenched down to 300 K with the quenching rate of 900 K/ps. The amorphous structures were then optimized by the static DFT\ncalculations until the Hellmann–Feynman forces were\n<0.02 eV/A˚ . For amorphous InGaZnO4 in cubic supercell, the pair-correlation functions of the In–O, Ga–O, Zn–O,\nand O–O atoms are shown in Fig. 2. The average coordination numbers of the In, Ga, and Zn atoms are 5.42\n(within r ¼ 2.5 A˚ ), 4.58 (r ¼ 2.2 A˚ ), and 4.29 (r ¼ 2.2 A˚ ),\nrespectively, with bonding to O atoms.\n\n## 3 Results 3.1 Structural Transitions Figure 3A Shows A Local\n\natomic structure of the as-generated amorphous InGaZnO4, and we denote this local structure as a DS. In order to simulate the excited holes in the stress conditions, we put two holes into the supercell and investigate the structural changes in the amorphous InGaZnO4. The DS- in the (2þ) holeinjected case is found to be meta-stable and prefers to be structurally transformed into the O2 2 PS-, of which structure\n\n![2_image_1.png](2_image_1.png)\n\nis shown in Fig. 3c. We plot the calculated total energies\n(LDA þ U) as a function of the O–O distance in Fig. 3e (red curve). The PS- is found to be 0.88 eV more stable than the DS-. The transition state (TS-) is found as shown in Fig. 3b, and the energy barrier (a) in the DS- to PS- transition is found to be 0.26 eV (Fig. 3e). This reaction can be written as\n\n$$\\mathrm{O}^{2-}+\\mathrm{O}^{2-}+2\\mathrm{h}^{+}\\to\\mathrm{O}_{2}^{2-},$$\n2 ; (1)\nand indicates that the peroxide is formed via mediated by holes.\n\nAfter the stress, the AOS materials go back to the electronic ground state. In the neutral charge state, the O2 2 PS is found to be meta-stable on the contrary to the (2þ) holeinjected case. As shown in Fig. 3e (blue curve), the PS is higher in energy by 1.25 eV than the DS. That is the reason why the peroxide defects are not preferentially formed in the as-generated amorphous structures. (It has been reported that peroxides are formed in rapidly quenched amorphous structure [27].) A significant energy barrier (b) of 0.69 (LDA þ U) and 0.97 eV (HSE) is found in the PS to DS\ntransition (Fig. 3e). The atomic structure of the transition state (TS) is depicted in Fig. 3d. The structural recovery process can be written as\n\n$$\\mathrm{O}_{2}^{2-}+2\\mathrm{e}^{-}\\to\\mathrm{O}^{2-}+\\mathrm{O}^{2-}\\,,$$\n2 þ 2e ! O2 þ O2; (2)\nand the significant b energy barrier indicates that it is a very slow process and the long persistency of the meta-stable O2 2 peroxide defect.\n\n3.2 Electronic structures In order to certify the holemediated formation of the peroxide defect (DS--to-PS-\n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)\n\ntransition), we investigate the electronic structures. The local\n\n![2_image_2.png](2_image_2.png) electronic densities of states (LDOS) near the two O atoms are shown in Fig. 4 for various O–O distances. In the (2þ)\nhole-injected DS-, the Fermi level crosses the VBT states\n(Fig. 4a). As the O–O distance is closer, a state emerges into the band gap with decoupled from the valence bands (Fig. 4b).\n\nThe state is found to be pps--like between the two O atoms\n(Fig. 5a). At the TS-, the pps--like state is almost empty\n(Fig. 4b). As the O–O distance is furthermore closer, the pps- level goes up even higher, and in the O2 2 PS-, it is found inside the conduction bands (Fig. 4c). Since, in the\n(2þ) hole-injected case, the pps bonding state is largely stabilized as the pps- anti-bonding level rises up (Fig. 4d),\n\n$$({\\mathfrak{I}})$$\n\n1280 H.-H. Nahm et al.: Instability of amorphous oxide semiconductors via transition to peroxide state physica p status s **solidi**sb\n\n![3_image_0.png](3_image_0.png)\n\n![3_image_1.png](3_image_1.png)\n\n![3_image_2.png](3_image_2.png)\n\nthe PS- becomes more stable than the DS-. The deoccupation of the anti-bonding pps--like VBT states (VBT holes) is the fundamental origin giving the driving force to form the peroxide defect.\n\nThe essential point here is that the VBT holes in AOS are characterized by the localized O–O pps- anti-bonding state\n(Fig. 5). The reason why the VBT states have the ppscharacter is obvious. In AOS, the upper valence bands are characterized by the O-2p anti-bonding states. In inter-site p–p coupling, the s–s- level splitting is much larger than the p–p- splitting, and the pps- forms the highest energy level.\n\nSince the VBT states are the highest among the anti-bonding states, they become to have at least partly the O–O pps- antibonding character. We find similar pps- character of the VBT states in different amorphous structures of InGaZnO4, and also in other AOS's of the In2Ga2ZnO7, In2Sn2Zn2O9, and In2Sn6Zn12O27 (Fig. 5). It can be also found in previous other calculations [27, 28].\n\nThe meta-stability of the peroxide defect (PS-to-DS\ntransition) is also clearly understood from the electronic structures. With the peroxide defect in the neutral charge state, the two electrons occupy the CBM state and the Fermi level is located near the CBM (Fig. 4g), where the pps- antibonding state is well empty. With breaking the O2 2 peroxide bond, the pps- level goes down with increasing the total energy (due to heightening up the occupied pps state), and when the pps- state crosses the CBM, two electrons occupy again the pps- state (Fig. 4f). The TS is thus found when the pps- is at the CBM (Fig. 4f). The O–O bond breaking is accelerated only after two electrons occupying the ppsstate, and the total energy lowers as shown in Fig. 3e, rendering the PS back to the DS. Thus, the b energy barrier originates from the level separation (d) between the Fermi level and the unoccupied pps- level in the PS (Fig. 4g). The d is calculated to be 2.9 (LDA þ U) and 3.9 eV (HSE) above the CBM (Fig. 6). Due to the high pps- level in the PS and the weak coupling with the conduction bands (there is no O-related state in the energy range of 1–3 eV in Fig. 4g),\nthe b energy barrier is as high as 0.69 (LDA þ U) and 0.97 eV (HSE), and it can be even higher if the Fermi level was inside the band gap (by some gap states).\n\n4 Discussion The carrier-mediated structural transitions have significant implications to the negative bias and/or illumination stress instability of AOS, and explain important experimental findings. We should emphasize that only if VBT holes are generated through any possible holegenerating stress, it is possible to form the peroxide defects.\n\nBy negative bias and/or illumination stress, which generates electron–hole pairs, the excited VBT holes act to form the peroxide defects through\n\n$$\\mathrm{O}^{2-}+\\mathrm{O}^{2-}+2\\mathrm{h}^{+}+2\\mathrm{e}^{-}\\rightarrow\\mathrm{O}_{2}^{2-}+2\\mathrm{e}^{-}.$$\n2 þ 2e: (3)\nDue to the meta-stability of O2 2 , the two electrons (2e)\noccupying the CBM state result in the increase of the Fermi level and the negative shift of Vth in AOS TFTs for a long time. The calculated b energy barrier (0.97 eV in HSE) for the recovery (Eq. (2)) is very close to the experimental activation energy of 0.9–1.0 eV [19]. In illumination stress, UV light should be very effective to generate VBT holes, and visible light can also induce VBT holes through the gapstate-assisted excitations (Fig. 7a), because there are lots of gap states in AOS [28]. Especially under combined negative bias and illumination stress (NBIS), the negative bias field accumulates the VBT holes near the interface between the AOS channel and the gate insulator (Fig. 7b). Then, a large density of peroxide defects can be generated near the interface in proportional to the VBT hole density. The negative bias will also reduce the a barrier by electrostatic energy through a0 ¼ a  qV, where q is the effective charge and V is the applied voltage near the interface [30, 31]. Thus, the NBIS can be very serious in AOS TFT instability. By only negative bias stress (NBS), it would be less effective to generate VBT holes, but if the applied voltage is large enough to form inversion AOS channel (Fig. 7c), the metastable peroxide defects can be formed near the interface.\n\nIn terminology of defects in crystalline semiconductors, the peroxide formation can be considered as a formation of a VO and O-interstitial (Oi) pair (O Frenkel-pair). The Oi is in a split-interstitial form with bonding to a host O atom (O–Oi),\nand charge neutral [ðO2  O0i Þ¼ðO  OiÞ\n2]. The VO is a\n(2þ) donor, and thus the two electrons can be considered to be doped by the created VO. The VO is found to be a shallow donor in all our calculations, and the Fermi level is found at the CBM in the PS, as shown in Fig. 4g. Although we cannot exclude the formation of a deep VO donor, the O–O bond near the VO can hinder the inward relaxation of the cation atoms around the VO (Fig. 3c). Experimentally, a reversible\n\n![3_image_3.png](3_image_3.png)\n\nstructural change that requires some relaxation time has been suggested and the generation and recombination of VO and Oi have been conjectured, which are proven theoretically by our structural transition model [32]. The meta-stable peroxide defect is also similar to the double-broken-bond\n(DBB) acceptor-compensating (AX) center in acceptordoped crystalline semiconductors [33]. Two cation–O bonds in the DS are broken and one O–O bond is created in the PS, as shown in Fig. 1a and c, respectively. The AX-like behavior of the peroxide defect can make p-type doping more difficult in AOS as an intrinsic compensating center.\n\nFrom the point of view of material engineering, it is important fundamentally to reduce the density of localized VBT states in AOS to improve the stability, since the formation of the meta-stable peroxide defects is mediated by the VBT holes. Post-annealing process has been known to reduce the density of VBT states [34]. It is because of reducing the high energy local amorphous configurations. The minimization of the VBT states should be a direction in process and material designs to obtain reliable AOS's.\n\n5 Conclusion The negative bias and/or illumination stress instability of AOS is suggested to originate from the carrier-mediated structural transition between the disorder and PS. The PS is meta-stable and the activation energy for the structural recovery is found to be 0.97 eV in hybrid density-functional theory. The main reason for the peroxide formation lies in the pps--like VBT states. Reduction of the VBT states is suggested as a fundamental direction to improve the stability of AOS-based devices.\n\nAcknowledgements Y.S.K. acknowledges the support by Nano R&D program through the National Research Foundation (NRF) of Korea funded by the Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology (MEST) (no. 2009-0082489).
