Terms &\nFabrication Of Transparent Semiconducting Indium Zinc Tin Oxide Thin Films And Its Wet Chemical Etching Characteristics In Hydrochloric Acid\nKEUN YOUNG LEE,1,2 HAN JAE SHIN,1 DONG CHEUL HAN,1 SUNYOUNG SON,1 SANG-WOO KIM,2 YUN-SU LEE,3 AND DO KYUNG LEE1 1Mobile Display Research Center, Gumi Electronics & Information Technology Research Institute, Gumi, Gyeongsangbuk-do, Republic of Korea 2School of a Advanced Materials Science and Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwan, Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea 3Advanced Display Manufacturing Research Center, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Republic of Korea We have fabricated the transparent semiconducting indium zinc tin oxide (IZTO) thin films on polymeric substrates at room temperature by RF-magnetron sputtering method, and investigated their wet chemical etching behavior in HCl solution. The study has revealed that the control of O2 flow rate during deposition attribute to the variation of resistivity for IZTO films, resulting in the conductor–semiconductor conductivity transition. The increasing etchant molarity and temperature of etching solution lead to the increase in etching rate of IZTO films according to the chemical dissolution reaction. As a result, the IZTO active channel is defined successfully, suggesting sufficient possibility for the application to flexible transparent thin film transistors. Keywords Flexible transparent thin film transistor; HCL etchant; indium zinc tin oxide (IZTO); transparent semiconductor; wet chemical etching\nRecently, transparent thin film transistors (TTFTs) fabricated on polymer substrates using oxide semiconductor have attracted much attention for the application of flexible displays due to high mobility, good uniformity and low process temperature [1–3].\nIn flexible TTFT device, the amorphous semiconducting oxides, indium-rich oxides such as In-Zn-O, In-Ga-Zn-O, and In-Ga-O, are suitable for the plastic substrate under low process temperature, because of being provided more uniform structure and smoother channel interface to the gate insulators, compared to polycrystalline semiconductor such as ZnO-based oxides .\nIt has been reported that amorphous transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) can be adjusted to the channel material in the TTFT by the control of conductivity, originating from the conductivity transition between conductor and semiconductor\n. Among TCOs, a promising material is indium zinc tin oxide (IZTO) because of their possibility for use as TCO films with excellent chemical and thermal stability, as well as high electrical conductivity and optical transparency .\nOn the other hands, in general, the wet chemical etching process is simpler than the dry method, and provides a high throughput and low cost. Therefore, wet etching is used to pattern TCO films in display manufacturing . For the application of IZTO semiconductor to flexible TTFT devices, the wet etching behavior must be investigated to evaluate its chemical stability and to explore etchants for use in wet etching, which is an essential subject for the device fabrication using this material. This work is motivated from the fact that wet chemical etching characteristics of IZTO thin films in the aqueous etching solutions conventionally used in TFT industry is yet to be reported. In wet etching process, hydrochloric acid\n(HCl) has been widely used as one of the conventional etchants for patterning of TCO films [9–11].\nHence, in this study, we have prepared transparent semiconducting IZTO thin film on polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) substrate by RF-magnetron sputtering method, and investigated their wet chemical etching characteristics in HCl solutions.\nThe IZTO thin films were deposited on the PEN (Teijin Dupont Films) substrate covered with hard coating layer, using a RF-magnetron sputtering method, at room temperature with varying O2 fraction in the mixture of Ar and O2. Prior to deposition, the substrates were cleaned with acetone, methanol and de-ionized water for 10 min in an ultrasonic bath. The base pressure in the chamber was adjusted to 1.0  106Torr and the pressure during the deposition was maintained at 3 mTorr regardless of O2 fraction in Ar and O2 gas mixture. The composition of 3 inch sputtering target used in the experiment was In2O3: ZnO: SnO2 ¼ 90: 7: 3 in weight ratio with purity of 99.99%.\nThe semiconducting IZTO films were patterned using a conventional photolithographic method. The etching was carried out in hydrochloric acid solutions as a function of etchant concentration and etching temperature. After etching process, the samples were rinsed in deionized water, the photoresist was stripped using acetone and then the films were dried in N2 flow.\nThe thickness and etching rates of the films were determined by a surface profiler (KLA Tencor, Alpha-Step IQ). In order to examine the crystallinity of IZTO thin films, x-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku, D=MAX-2500) measurement was performed. The XRD diffraction patterns of the films did not contain any peaks attributable to crystal, indicating amorphous state. The electrical properties of IZTO thin films were obtained from the Hall Effect measurement (Ecopia, HMS-3000) by the Van der Pauw technique. Optical transmittance characteristics of the films were measured by means of an ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer (Otsuka, MCPD-7000) in the visible region. Optical microscope (Olympus, BX51 M) and field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, JEOL,\nJSM-7000 F) were used to observe the pattern images and etching profiles, respectively.\nResults And Discussion\nFigure 1 shows the influence of O2 flow rate in the sputtering deposition on the deposition rate of the IZTO thin films. It is observed that when oxygen flow rate increases, deposition rate of the films decreases gradually. The decrease in the deposition rate with O2 flow rate is caused by the relative reduction of Ar fraction under constant pressure, resulting in lower sputtering yield of the target material.\nAlthough the deposition rate is varied with O2 flow rate, by the control of sputtering time, the thickness of the deposited IZTO films is fixed at about 100 nm, which is confirmed by the cross section images of a FE-SEM.\nFigure 2 indicates the dependence of electrical properties of IZTO thin films on the oxygen flow rate. It is seen from Figure 2 that with an increasing oxygen flow rate, the resistivity of the films increases while the Hall mobility and carrier concentration decrease. It is known that the variation in the resistivity of the TCO thin film is attributed to the combined effect of changes in carrier concentration and Hall mobility, which in turn is associated with the oxygen vacancies . As oxygen flow rate increases, due to the fact that the concentration of oxygen vacancies is decreased as a result of the incorporation of oxygen into the films, the amount of free carriers arising from the doubly charged oxygen vacancies is reduced, in addition that the creation of electron scattering centers such as the neutral defects and the negatively charged oxygen gives rise to interrupt electron transport, resulting in the decrease of Hall mobility . Accordingly, the increases in electrical resistivity with oxygen flow rates are originated in the elimination of the oxygen vacancies in the films. In a viewpoint of TTFT application, it is interesting that the resistivity of IZTO\nthin films, which is inversely proportional to the conductivity, can be controlled by introduction of O 2 gas during deposition, occurring in the metal–semiconductor conductivity transition. The similar phenomenon has been observed in a recent work on In-Zn-O thin films by E. Fortunato, et al. . Hence, it is worth noting that the IZTO films deposited in pure Ar ambient shows the resistivity of about 3.5 × 10 − 4 Ω cm, which can be used as the source, drain and gate electrodes in TTFT\ndevices. In particular, because resistivity within the order of 1 Ω cm can serve well as active channel in TTFT applications , the IZTO film grown at 12 secm oxygen flow rate is a semiconductor showing the resistivity of about 1.4   cm, which corresponds to carrier concentration of about 9.1 × 10 17 /cm 3 and Hall mobility of about 4.9 cm 2 /Vs. Also, it cannot be ruled out that a channel material for TTFT must be fabricated with low carrier density and high carrier mobility . The carrier concentration and mobility of IZTO semiconducting film are superior to those of sputtered In-Ga-Zn-O film , which can be a good candidate for the channel in flexible TTFT device.\nThe optical transmission spectrum of the semiconducting IZTO films in the wavelength range between 350 and 800 nm is shown in Figure 3. For comparison, transmittance of the PEN substrate is also indicated. The optical transmittances of\n~86.5% and ~86% at 550 nm wavelength are obtained for the PEN substrate and the IZTO films on the PEN, respectively. This result indicates that a semiconducting IZTO films is transparent in the visible region.\nBased on the above results, it can be concluded that the IZTO thin film deposited at 12 sccm oxygen flow rate is an amorphous semiconductor with high optical transparency, which can be applied to the channel layer in TTFT\ndevices, and the subsequent investigation on characteristics of wet chemical etching is conducted.\nFigure 4(a) and (b) represent the effect of reaction temperature on the etching rate of the IZTO semiconductor under different HCl molarity and the corresponding logarithm plots as a function of reciprocal temperature, respectively. As seen in Figure 4(a), it can be easily found that the etching rate increases with the increase of etching temperature and etchant concentration. It has been known that the wet etching reaction rate can be controlled by changing the solution concentration and\nreaction temperature . Also, from the inserted figure in Figure 4(a), under reaction temperature of 25C, the IZTO etching rate is about 0.3 nm=sec at 2.97 M HCl concentration, which is satisfactory as to the requirements  on the industrial process. The variation of the etching rate as a function of temperature has a relation with the chemical etching activation energy. The linear plots for the logarithm of etching rate demonstrates that the Arrhenius relationship is obeyed in the reactions between 25 and 60C. The activation energy is then calculated from the slopes of these plots. As indicated in Figure 4(b), the calculated activation energies of etching IZTO films with HCl acid are found to be from 48.7 to 68.9 kJ=mol. These high values can be explained by the chemical dissolution reaction  rather than electrochemical reaction. The chemical dissolution reaction of the IZTO film in HCl solutions can be described by the following reactions from\n$$\\mathrm{In_{2}O_{3}+6H C l\\to2In C l_{3}+3H_{2}O}$$\nIn2O3 þ 6HCl ! 2InCl3 þ 3H2O ð1Þ\n$${\\rm ZnO}+2{\\rm HCl}\\rightarrow{\\rm ZnCl}_{2}+{\\rm H}_{2}{\\rm O}\\tag{2}$$  $${\\rm SnO}_{2}+4{\\rm HCl}\\rightarrow{\\rm SnCl}_{4}+2{\\rm H}_{2}{\\rm O}\\tag{3}$$\nThese chemical reactions indicate that by actions of HCl, In, Zn, and Sn in the IZTO\nfilms effectively removed from the surface as the etch product of respective InCl3, ZnCl2, and SnCl4. Accordingly, the increase of HCl mole concentration and solution temperature can accelerate the etching activity and the chemical reaction rate, respectively. However, a noticeable point is that dilute HCl solutions are desired to be used in order to achieve controllable etching rate at room temperature, as previously mentioned.\nFigure 5 illustrates the pattern image (a) and etch profile (b) of semiconducting IZTO films after wet chemical etching with 2.97 M HCl concentration at 25C. In Figure 5(a), it is obvious that the IZTO film is removed by dissolution along with stripping, showing the well defined channel. Also, the occurrences of surface residual byproduct and undercut pattern cannot be observed, which is attributed to relatively low etching rate and adequate thickness of photoresist to protect the pattern.\nBut, steep sidewall slop of the etched pattern is difficulty to be obtained, originating in isotropic etching characteristic of wet chemical etching for amorphous semiconductor, as shown in Figure 5(b).\nIn summary, transparent amorphous IZTO thin films were prepared by RF-magnetron sputtering techniques. The resistivity of IZTO films can be controlled by varying O2 fraction in sputtering gas during deposition, resulting in the conductor-semiconductor conductivity transition. With increasing HCl mole concentrations and etching solution temperature, etching rate of semiconducting IZTO films are increased following the mechanism of chemical dissolution reaction. In addition, with dilute HCl solution at room temperature, the excellent pattern of IZTO channel is obtained. On the basis of this work, therefore, we suggest that fabrication of semiconducting IZTO film by the RF-magnetron sputtering method and subsequent wet chemical etching in HCl solution are suitable processes for the preparation of active channel in flexible TTFT.\nAccordingly, the systematic studies on the performance of flexible IZTO-based TTFT devices are also needed to investigate and determine the optimized conditions for flexible transparent display."

In addition, low temperature processing at 200 C\nmakes a-IGZO devices compatible with flexible substrates and potentially enabling them to be exploited in flexible transparent displays . A bottom-gate a-IGZO TFT with an etch stopper structure is widely used for display applications, but it has a high parasitic capacitance ( ) because of the overlap between the gate and source/drain electrodes. The overlap is required as a misalignment margin for the photolithographic processes used to define the shapes of the gate, source/drain, and etch-stopper. This is proportional to the overlap area, and results in kickback/feed-through voltage, which induces signal RC delay in TFT arrays .

Therefore the effect of varying on device reliability, especially stability, needs to be understood. stability is required for long lifetime in active matrix displays , . Therefore, many recent articles related with a-IGZO TFT stability have been focused on reducing the shift ( ) –.\nIn this work, we report the dependency of the electrical stability of a-IGZO TFTs with a self-aligned coplanar structure\n. The short- TFT is found to have less compared to long- TFT. The time dependence of the under PBS is fitted to a stretched-exponential formula. An a-IGZO TFT with m exhibits a much longer time constant compared to a TFT with m.\nIi. Device Fabrication\nscanning electron microscope (SEM) image of a self-aligned coplanar a-IGZO TFT. The detailed fabrication process is described elsewhere , . On a 200-nm-thick oxide buffer layer on glass, a 20-nm-thick a-IGZO was deposited by direct current (DC) sputtering using a polycrystalline IGZO target (In O Ga O ZnO ) at 200 C. A 200-nm-thick SiO layer was deposited at 170 C by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) as a gate insulator and a protection layer of the oxide semiconductor. Not that the buffer layer, active layer and gate insulator are deposited consecutively without breaking vacuum. After Mo patterning for gate electrodes, the SiO gate insulator was then etched using a self-aligned process and then the a-IGZO layer was patterned by a wet etch process. Then, a 200-nm-thick SiN layer was deposited as an interlayer by PECVD and via-holes were formed. After deposition of the SiN layer, the source and drain regions of the a-IGZO semiconductor are doped n .\nAs described in detail in  and , SiN x contains a lot of hydrogen, which can diffuse into the a-IGZO. Sato et al.  and Ahn et al.  reported that hydrogen acts as donor in a-IGZO. This will effectively make the source and drain regions n + . Note that the channel region is protected by the SiO 2 gate-insulator and Mo gate metal from any contact with SiN n and therefore remains intrinsic. Finally, a 200-nm-thick Mo layer was deposited and patterned as source/drain electrodes. The TFT I-V characteristics were measured at room temperature, using the Agilent 4156C precision semiconductor parameter analyzer.\nIi. R Esults And D Iscussion\nIn order to investigate the L dependency of ∆ V th under bias stress, we carried out the gate bias stress experiments on the self-aligned a-IGZO TFTs with various L . Fig. 2 shows the evolution of transfer characteristics and field-effect mobility ( l fc ) under PBS ( V G_STRESS = +20 V, for 10 000 s) for the TFTs with L of (a) 10 µ m and (b) 2 µ m. Fig. 2(c) is the histogram of the | ∆ V th | for 31 TFTs with L = 2 µ m after applying PBS\nfor 1000 s. The source and drain electrodes were connected to ground during gate bias stress and the channel widths of all TFT's were 20 µ m. The V th of the oxide TFTs shifts to the positive direction under PBS . The | ∆ V th | of the device with L = 10 µ m is 4.1 V after applying PBS for 10 000 s. The µ fe ,\nwhich is derived from the transconductance gm, also shifts in a similar fashion [Fig. 2(a)]. An obvious difference is that a peak value in µ fe exists for short channel devices, whereas in long channel devices the µ fo continues to increase with increasing V GS , within the measured range of V GS . As there are more carriers in the channel of the former compared to that of the latter, it is reasonable to attribute the decrease in mobility of the former to carrier scattering at higher VGS values.\nOn the other hand, the | ∀ V th | for the device with L = 2 µ m is only 0.3 V after PBS for the same stress time [Fig. 2(b)].\n| Channel length ( μ m)   | τ (sec)   | β value   |\n|-------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| 40                      | 2.50 x 10 | 0.323     |\n| 20                      | 4.87 x 10 | 0.343     |\n| 10                      | 3.81 x 10 | 0.330     |\n| 000                     | 1.38 x 10 | 0.339     |\n| 1166                    | 1.87 x 10 | 0.347     |\n| 0.398                   |           |           |\n| 4                       | 3.53 x 10 | 0.530     |\n| 9.38 x 10               |           |           |\nat various positions across a 6\"× 6\" glass substrate. Almost all of the TFTs undergo | ∆ V th | < 1 V, verifying good reliability and uniformity of these short channel devices. The instability of L dependence is clearly seen in PBS and these results cannot be explained only by a charge trapping model , . In contrast, negative bias stress (NBS) and negative bias illumination stress (NBIS) for the a-IGZO TFTs with various L were measured and the results indicate they are independent of L .\nTo investigate the L dependence of threshold voltage instability, we measured the instabilities of the TFTs with various L under PBS. Fig. 3(a) shows the time dependence of | ∆ V t h | as a function of L . The L is varied between 2 and 40 µ m. Note that instability increases with increasing L but saturates at L ≥ 10 µ m. Fig. 3(b) shows that the measured time-dependence of | ∀ V th | is well fitted by the stretched-exponential equation,\n$$\\Delta V_{\\rm th}|=V_{\\rm O}\\left\\{1-\\exp\\left[-\\left(\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right)^{\\beta}\\right]\\right\\}\\tag{1}$$\nwhere V O , T and β are saturation value of | ∆ V th | , characteristic time of carrier trapping, and stretched exponential parameter, respectively . The | ∆ V eh | by PBS decreases with decreasing L . A good fit is achieved when τ is 9.38 × 10 6 and 3.81 × 10 5 s, respectively for L of 2 and 10 µ m. Table I summarizes τ and β values extracted for varying L .\nWe measured the resistance of the intrinsic a-IGZO (channel region) and that of the n + a-IGZO (source and drain a-IGZO regions), using resistance measurement test structure, consisting of strips of a-IGZO covered by SiO 2 and SiN x , respectively.\nThe measured resistivity ( ) was 1.05 10 cm for n a-IGZO region and 1.20 10 cm for the intrinsic region. Therefore, the resistivity of the channel region is much higher than that of the n a-IGZO source and drain regions by about 3 orders of magnitude. The carrier concentration can be estimated from the sheet resistivity measurements for the channel and n source and drain region of the a-IGZO films by assuming the mobility of 15 cm V s which was obtained from the performance of the a-IGZO TFTs. The carrier density was found to be 3.5 10 cm and 4.0 10 cm in the channel and n a-IGZO regions, respectively. This is due to high concentrations of H in SiN , which results in the diffusion of from the top SiN interlayer to the a-IGZO region, making it n .\nNote that H diffusion from the SiO gate insulator is insignificant because the content in SiO is negligible. It is therefore worth noting that short channel devices exhibit a more negative initial compared to long channel devices. This difference can be explained by carrier diffusion from the n doped source/drain regions to the intrinsic channel region, and thereby shifting the Fermi level ( ) towards the conduction band minimum ( ). This unintentional doping is mainly confined to the channel edges. As a result, the effect is dominant in short channel devices (hence, the negative ) and becomes less and less effective as increases. The detailed explanation of dependence on is presented in .\nWe therefore propose a model to explain the stability dependence on as shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b). The carrier concentration is different between the channel and n a-IGZO regions in oxide TFTs. This difference makes carrier diffusion gradient into the channel from the edges of the channel. This diffusion of carriers increases the carrier concentration of the channel edges as shown in Fig. 4(a). Because of the diffusion gradient, the effect is therefore very significant in short channel devices, and less significant in longer channel devices. Since the carrier concentration in the channel of oxide TFTs corresponds to the Fermi level ( ) , the of shorter channel devices is closer to the conduction band ( ) compared to that of longer channel devices. The extracted of self-aligned coplanar a-IGZO TFTs is 0.109 eV and 0.193 eV for m and 20 m, respectively, by - and - measurements . Therefore, assuming the same number of trap states in short and long channel devices, there are less unoccupied states at/near the semiconductor/gate–insulator interface in short channel devices than there are in long channel devices [Fig. 4(b)]. As a result, there is less electron trapping in short channel devices compared to long channel devices under PBS. This is consistent with the fact that the stability of TFTs with m is similar, but can be improved significantly for m. The big difference with Si device physics is due to the much higher mobility and carrier lifetime ( ) product in a-IGZO as compared to a-Si or nc-Si  and the fact that Si is doped by substitutional ion doping, whereas a-IGZO is doped by varying the oxygen (or hydrogen) content. Since the PBS instability of the devices presented herein depends on the position of , it is reasonable to attribute the induced by the PBS to carrier trapping into traps located inside the a-IGZO region near the a-IGZO/gate-insulator interface. Under PBS, with grounded source and drain electrodes, a uniform potential is kept across the channel, which causes\nthe drift of electrons towards the a-IGZO/gate-insulator interface at high energies. If the number of un-occupied trap states is large at the interface, as in the case of long channel devices, the occupational probability is also large, hence a large number of electrons may become trapped into these trap states. Note that a higher corresponds to a smaller number of unoccupied trap states [Fig. 4(b)]. When the - characteristics are measured after PBS, the trapped charge impose a positive-bias-effect in which they screen the applied electric field, thereby reducing the effective applied gate voltage - hence the positive .\nConsequently, a device with a high (short-channel device),\nwill exhibit negligible after PBS [Fig. 2(b)]. Therefore, the shift by PBS in coplanar a-IGZO TFTs can be reduced by decreasing .\nIn summary, we have studied the effect of channel length on electrical stability of a-IGZO TFT with a self-aligned coplanar structure. For short-channel devices ( m), the is much less as compared to long channel devices. We propose the mechanism of channel length dependence of PBS that is based on the shift of the Fermi level towards the conduction band edge with decreasing channel length. The shift of is caused by carrier diffusion from the n doped source and drain regions to the intrinsic channel region. These results indicate that stability against PBS can be improved by raising . If is raised, the number of un-occupied trap states decreases, resulting in less electron trapping under PBS - hence less .\n M. Mativenga, M. H. Choi, D. H. Kang, and J.

        "text": "16.9-Inch Flexible Amoled Display With High Performance Top Gate Oxide Tft Yuanjun Hsu *, Zhenguo Lin*,Yihong Lu*, Baixiang Han*, Weiran Cao*, Yuan-Chun Wu*, Xin Zhang * ** Shenzhen China Star Optoelectronics Semiconductor Display Technology Co.

To improve flexible capability and reduce cost of flexible OLED display, integrated gate driver on array (GOA) circuits with spilt channel structure has been investigated. Finally, we successfully realize 16.9-inch rollable OLED display with high performance top gate IGZO TFT and GOA circuits Author Keywords Top-gate IGZO; Flexible; AMOLED display; GOA;\n1. **Introduction**\nRecently, flexible active matrix organic light-emitting diode (AMOLED) displays have attracted more and more attentions due to its light weight, bendable/rollable characteristics, fast response time, high contrast and low power consumption. To realize flexible AMOLED displays, it becomes necessary to develop thin film transistor fabricated on flexible substrate . For large-scale flexible OLEDs, amorphous oxide semiconductor TFTs, such as a-IGZO TFTs, are considered as next-generation backplane technology due to their bendable/rollable characteristic, high mobility, high uniformity and low processing temperature. Top-gate self-aligned coplanar structure is currently the best candidate structure for its low parasitic capacitance and superior TFT performance for large size and high resolution AMOLED display . Flexible displays will go through mechanical stress when they are bended, which might deteriorate the electrical characteristics of IGZO-TFT. Also, electrical and reliability characteristics of flexible TFTs will be affected due to moisture permeation through Polyimide (PI) substrate. These issues should be overcome before its commercialization. In this paper, we investigate device performance and electrical characteristics of flexible top-gate IGZO TFTs fabricated on PI. Furthermore, 16.9 inch flexible AMOLED display with top-gate IGZO is fabricated. Meanwhile, integrated gate driver on array (GOA) circuits has been used to improve flexible capability and reduce cost.\n2. Experiment\nFabrication of self-aligned top-gate oxide thin film transistor: In order to compare the electrical characteristics and reliability between rigid and flexible IGZO TFTs, top-gate IGZO TFTs with different substrates were fabricated. The crosssectional diagram of a-IGZO TFTs with top-gate structure fabricated on PI and Glass are demonstrated in Fig.1(a) and (b), respectively. For the TFTs fabricated on PI, PI was coated and cured on the glass. To prevent oxygen and water vapor permeation, multi-barrier layer was deposited by plasmaenhanced chemical vapor deposition(PECVD). Then, Cu layer were deposited and patterned to prevent light exposure to IGZO layer. Subsequently, buffer layers were deposited by PECVD. After that, IGZO active layer was deposited and patterned. Then, gate insulating layer (GI), gate electrode layer (M1) are deposited and patterned by one mask to form self-aligned structure. n+ IGZO region is formed by plasma treatment. After that, the Inter Layer Dielectric (ILD) layer and source/drain layer(M2) were deposited and patterned to form top-gate structure. Finally, passivation (PV) layer were deposited and patterned. The cross-sectional diagram of TFTs fabricated on PI is shown in Fig.1 (a) .For comparison, TFTs on glass without PI and multi-barrier were also fabricated , as shown in Fig.1 (b). The dimension of TFTs studied in this work are all the same size of W/L=10μm/8μm.\nFigure 1. Cross-section diagram of the top-gate selfaligned a-IGZO TFT fabricated on (a) PI and (b) Glass Fabrication of Ink-jet printed organic light-emitting diode display: The top –emission-structure OLED layers were formed by ink jet printing technology on the TFT backplane. The R/G/B subpixel were ink-jet printed individually, which enables high material efficiency and reduce production cost. Subsequently, thin film encapsulation layers were formed to prevent moisture and oxygen permeation. Finally, to protect the OLED display, a protect film was formed on the OLED display.\n3. Results And Discussion\nTo compare the electrical difference of TFTs fabricated on PI and on glass, 13 groups of TFTs, located in different areas of Gen. 4.5 glass, were measured by an Keithley 4200-SCS semiconductor parameter analyzer. The I-V transfer curves are recording the drain current (Ids) with the gate voltage (Vgs) from -15 V to 20 V. Two curves are plotted with 0.1V and 10V of the drain voltage (Vds). The transfer curve of the a-IGZO TFTs fabricated on PI and glass are shown in Fig.2(a) and (b), respectively. Both PI-based and Glass-based TFTs show good electrical performance. The mean filed–effect linear mobility of PI-based and glass-based TFTs are 14.84 cm2/Vs and 14.58 cm2/Vs, respectively. The mean Vth, which is defined as the voltage at normalized Ids = 10-9 A, are 0.18 V and 0.22 V for PI-based and glass-based TFTs , respectively. The detail \nelectrical performance are labeled in Fig.(2). The PI-based TFTs show almost the same electrical properties with the Glass-based TFTs, which might be ascribe to the high-performance multibarrier layers and optimized fabrication process. \n![1_image_1.png](1_image_1.png) Reliability of TFT is an important parameter in display since it directly affects the panel reliability. In order to investigate the reliability of PI-based TFTs, we have measured the long-term positive bias temperature stress (PBTS) and negative bias temperature illumination stress (NBTS) of PI-based TFTs. The PBTS test is measured under Vg = 30V at 60 ˚С and dark environment for 10h and the NBTIS test is measured under Vg = -30 V at 60 ˚С and 4500 nit of white light intensity for 10 hours. Fig.3(a) and (b) show the PBTS and NBTIS results, respectively. The PBTS shifts and NBTIS shifts for 10 h stress are only 0.26 V and -0.34 V, respectively. The high reliability of the PI-based TFTs might be ascribed to the screen effect of the light shield layer, which enable the electrical separation between the polyimide and the channel .This result shows the PI-based TFTs are suitable for large-scale flexible OLED display. \n![1_image_3.png](1_image_3.png) \nΔVth=+0.26V ΔVth=-0.34V\nFor the development of flexible AMOLED displays, it is necessary to investigate the mechanical bending properties of the TFT backplane. For the bending test, the TFT was outward bent (under tensile strain) at a curvature radius of 20mm for 200,000 cycles. The bending axes is applied perpendicular to the channel length. After specific bending cycles, transfer curves of IGZO-TFT were measured in the flat state. The transfer curves after the 200,000 bending cycles remained almost the same as before the bending test, as shown in Fig. 4(a). After 200,00 tensile bending cycles, only a small change of the threshold voltage (-0.03 V) is observed, as shown in Fig.4(b). Meanwhile, There is no significant change of Ioff current, which shows good bending characteristic of our flexible devices. \n![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png) \nIntegrated gate driver on array (GOA) circuits has been used to improve flexible capability and reduce cost. In order to reduce the temperature for the large W/L TFTs in the GOA circuit, the channel width splitting method has been proposed.For the TFT with dimension of W/L=2400/8, TFTs are divided into several units with a fixed unit width. Device A with 50 um of unit width and Device B with 25 um of unit width are fabricated, respectively. The space of IGZO channel is fixed for both Device A and Device B. The transfer curve of the a-IGZO TFTs of Device A and Device B are shown in Fig.5(a) and (b), respectively. Device A with large unit width of 50 um shows lower Vth (mean Vth = -0.91 V) than that of Device B with unit width of 25 um (mean Vth = 0.02 V). For better function of GOA circuits, Device B with enhancement mode are chosen for the base structure of GOA circuit. The PBTS and NBTS results for 1h of Device B are shown in Fig.6(a) and (b), respectively. The PBTS shift and NBTS shift for 1 h stress are only 0.39 V and -0.08 V, respectively. The good reliability shows the split channel structure is suitable for the GOA circuit.\n![1_image_6.png](1_image_6.png) \n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png) \n![2_image_1.png](2_image_1.png) \nΔVth=+0.39V ΔVth=-0.08V\nFig.7(a) shows the schematic diagram and output signal of the GOA circuit. A single stage circuit of this gate driver consists of 18 TFTs and 1 bootstrap capacitor. T21~T23 are the pull-up unit; T11, T12 and T6 are the pull-up control unit; T31,T32 and T33 are the pull-down unit. T41~T45 are the pull-down holding unit. T51~T54 are the inverter unit. The detailed operation of the gate driver could be seen in the earlier research . Figure 7(b) shows the output waveform of the gate driver for input VDD of 20 V. There are almost no degradation during the operation of GOA circuit. This gate driver is thus suitable for the AMOLED display.\nFinally, we demonstrate the 16.9 flexible AMOLED display with a top emission structure on PI substrate. Fig.8(a) shows the prototype display with top gate a-IGZO TFT and GOA circuit. The panel specifications are shown in Fig.8(b). The flexible AMOLED display could be rolled at a radius of 20 mm, which shows an excellent brightness uniformity and good image quality .\n4. **Conclusion**\nWe have reported the 16.9-inch flexible AMOLED displays with an integrated gate driver and top-gate a-IGZO TFTs. The top-gate a-IGZO TFTs exhibit excellent reliability and mechanical property on PI substrate. The ΔVth under PBTS and NBTIS for 10 hours are only +0.26 V and -0.34 V, respectively. There are almost no change after 200,000 bending cycle test at a curvature radius of 20mm. The split channel structure TFTs are adopted in the GOA circuit, which shows good reliability.\n5.

Recently we reported high performance TFETs exhibiting good performances such as normally-off characteristics with on-to-off current ratios .106 using InGaO3sZnOd5 sIGZOd.\n5 The materials have crystal structures belonging to space groupes of R3m (for n=odd numbers) or P63 */mmc* sn=evend, in which alternate stacking of RO2\n+ layers forms periodic layered structures along the k0001l axis.6,7 Therefore, it is expected to exhibit exceptional properties originating from the two-dimensional nature of the natural layered structure as observed in artificial superlattices8 if appropriate constituents are chosen for R and M. Another structural feature is that M3+ and Zn2+ ions share trigonal bipiramidal and tetrahedral sites in the MO+sZnOdn layers randomly, which forms a random system in the intrinsic crystal structure with the stoichiometric composition\n[therefore it may also be represented as RsM,ZnndOn+3].\nIt is known that device performance strongly depends on the quality and transport mechanism of active channel materials.9 Therefore, intrinsic carrier transport properties have been investigated, especially on representative TOSs such as ZnO and SnO2 using single crystals. By contrast, although there are several reports on transport properties in the homologous compounds,10–12 intrinsic carrier transport properties inherent to this material system are not clear yet because of the difficulty in fabricating single-crystalline thin films. As a consequence, intrinsic properties were masked by grain-boundary (GB) effects including GB barrier-controlled transport and generation of high-concentration carriers even in as-prepared states.\nIn this letter, we report carrier transport properties in IGZO using single-crystalline films. Single-crystalline IGZO\nfilms (sc-IGZO) ,250 nm in thickness were grown on (111)-\noriented yttria-stabilized-zirconia (YSZ) single-crystal substrates by reactive solid-phase epitaxy (R-SPE).\n13–15 It was confirmed that the as-prepared films have carrier concentrations (Ne) lower than 1014 cm−3 when films have stoichiometric chemical composition and are single-crystalline. Carrier concentration was controlled by postannealing at 550–650 °C for 1–3 h in H2-bearing gas (H2-reduction treatment), which increased the carrier concentration up to\n,1019 cm−3. Hall effect measurements were carried out using the van der Pauw configuration with ac modulation of magnetic field in the temperature range from room temperature (RT) to 30 K. Sputtered Au electrodes were used for ohmic contacts.\nFor comparison, polycrystalline (pc-) IGZO films were prepared on YSZ (111) substrates by a simple pulsed laser deposition (PLD) process at 600 °C (average lateral grain size is ,70 nm observed by AFM). Figure 1(a) shows temperature dependence of Hall mobility smd and Ne for the pc-IGZO films with various Ne values. The m value exhibits a thermally activated behavior even if Ne is larger than 1019 cm−3, while the Ne value is almost temperature independent for the films with Ne larger than 1018 cm−3. This behavior, which is often observed in polycrystalline semiconductors,16–18 indicates that the Fermi level sEFd already exceeds the conduction band edge in crystalline grains when Ne is .1018 cm−3, but the carrier transport is limited by a double-Schottky potential barriers formed due to carrier trapping at GBs. Therefore m shows thermally activated behavior even when Ne becomes temperature independent.\nOn the other hand, sc-IGZO showed a behavior [Fig.\ndegenerate conduction is achieved. This threshold value, an order of magnitude lower than that observed for pc-IGZO, is too low to understand by the GB barrier model. It is therefore thought that the sc-IGZO films exhibit intrinsic transport properties of single-crystalline IGZO (i.e., not affected by GB effects). We like to note that carrier concentration is temperature independent for any Ne in spite of the fact that the m value exhibits the large temperature dependence at Ne,1018 cm−3.\n−1 as Ne increases only from ,2 to 4 31018 cm−3. The transition Ne value (Nth,331018 cm−3 is used hereafter) is almost consistent with the value where the carrier transport changes to degenerate conduction observed in Fig. 1(b).\nFor the films with carrier concentrations less than 1 31017 cm−3, we could not observe definite Hall voltage sig-\nnals. Therefore we measured dc electrical conductivity ssd using the standard two-probe method (Fig. 3). RT conductivity ssRTd of the as-prepared sc-IGZO film was between 10−7 and 2310−5 S cm−1, which values correspond to Ne values from ,1012 to 1014 cm−3 deduced using a mobility value ,2 cm2sV sd\n−1 obtained for the low Ne samples. The sRT\nvalue is increased to .10 S cm−1 by the H2-reduction treatment.\nFigure 3 shows that s does not follow a simple thermally activated behavior since the Arrhenius plots exhibit large deviations from straight lines especially at &160 K for all the samples that have carrier concentrations ø7 31017 cm−3 and do not exhibit degenerate conduction. Better straight lines are obtained in the log s versus T −1/4 plot in the whole temperature region (inset to Fig. 3). It shows that s obeys the s=s0 expf−A/T1/4g relation for the films with Ne,Nth, which behavior is often interpreted as variable-range hopping (VRH) caused by localized states in disordered or highly doped semiconductors including doped or solid-solution oxides.19 However, we should stress that the definite Hall voltages were observed in the films with Ne values ù131017 cm−3 as already seen in Fig. 1(b). It implies that the VRH mechanism does not likely dominate the carrier transport in this intermediate Ne region in spite of the fact that the temperature dependence of s fits well with that of the VRH model.\nA consistent model to explain all the above-described observations is that the conduction mechanism is controlled by percolation conduction, as it is known that a percolation conduction model also yields the T −1/4 behavior if the potential barrier height has Gaussian-type distributions.20 This model would be reasonable for the homologous series compounds including IGZO, because the random distribution of Ga3+ and Zn2+ ions in the GaO+sZnOd5 layer modulates the electronic structure around the conduction band edge and may form statistical potential distribution. This situation sounds similar to the Anderson localization observed in amorphous or disordered semiconductors, where structural disorder forms localized tail states just below the conduction band edge.21 However, the present case for IGZO is essentially different because the carriers are not localized and\ncontribute to electronic conduction and to Hall voltage signals at least for Neù131017 cm−3 even though s shows the VRH-like behavior.\nFrom these results, we can deduce a more specific model for the electronic structure. Hereafter, we call the electronic states where carriers exhibit the T −1/4 behavior as \"tail states\" as an analogue to amorphous semiconductor cases. In addition, there is a threshold energy sEthd that separates the carrier conduction mechanisms from percolation to degenerate conduction at Nth. If we approximate that temperature smearing of the Fermi–Dirac distribution is negligible, we can build a simplified model in which electrons with energies sEd less than EF fill the tail states and thereby EF is determined solely by Ne and the function of density of state D\nsEd. Therefore, Ne reflects the total density of electrons in the tail state sNtail state=eEV\nEFDs«dd«d and the Es corresponds to Eth-EF. Figure 4(a) summarizes the relationship between logsNed and activation energy of s sEsd (obtained at RT from Fig. 3), showing a good straight line and provides an exponential decay of the tail density of states DsEd\n=Nth /E0 expfsEC−Ed/E0g with Nth=331018 cm−3 and E0\nFigure 4(b) schematically illustrates the electronic structure deduced. In the compound, it is thought that there is a tail state having the exponential density of state and the distribution in the height of the potential barriers around the conduction band edge, leading to percolation hopping conduction and low electron mobilities when Ne is lower than Nth=331018 cm−3 as seen in Fig. 3. A definite Hall voltage signal is observed when Ne is larger than 1017 cm−3, suggesting that the drift distance of the electrons is large enough for giving a definite Hall voltage. Although it is not easy to estimate the spatial sizes between adjacent barriers experimentally, a mean distance between the adjacent tail-state levels sld in the energy range of kBT around EF may be used for an indication, which is estimated as s*kBTD*sEFdd−1/3. It gives an l value of ,14 nm for the film with Ne,131017 cm−3 and Ea,63 meV at RT. This value would be consistently large to explain the fact that definite Hall voltage is observed and that the Hall voltage, consequently Ne, does not show temperature dependence. In the intermediate region s1014 cm−3,Ne,Nthd, the carriers still need to flow over the potential barriers as EF is below Eth, leading to the thermally activated percolation behaviors in m and s. When EF exceeds Eth at Ne.Nth, the carriers are not affected by potential barriers anymore and exhibit the temperature-independent extended mobility. When Ne is very low, e.g., ,1014 cm−3, the carriers exist only in limited space at the energies lower than EF. Therefore, the carriers may become really \"localized\" and thereby do not generate Hall voltage. For pc-IGZO, GBs form potential barriers higher than EC, therefore m still exhibited thermally excited behavior even when Ne exceeds Nth (i.e., EF exceeds Eth).\nIn conclusion, we examined carrier transport properties in InGaO3sZnOd5 using single-crystalline films. Percolation conduction was observed when Ne was lower than Nth=3 31018 cm−3 while carrier transport changes to degenerate conduction at Ne.Nth accompany a sharp increase in the room temperature Hall mobility from ,1 to\n−1. It is associated with an insulator–metal transition due to distribution of potential barriers formed around the conduction band edge. The potential barriers are thought to originate from random distribution of Ga3+ and Zn2+ ions in the GaO+sZnOd5 layer. The carriers in the potential barriers contribute to electronic conduction and exhibit percolation hopping conduction. The present findings indicate that induction of the electron density .Nth is necessary to obtain large mobility and high-performances in drift carrier devices using TOSs with randomness in intrinsic crystal structures.\n1M.

The TFT mobilities exceed 10 cm V s-, which are more than ten times larger than those of conventional amorphous semiconductor devices. In addition, they operate at low voltages, e.g., **5 V owing**\nto their small subthreshold voltage swings. These features indicate that electron transport in oxide semiconductors are insensitive to random structures and these oxides do not form high-density defects that affect electron transport and TFT operation. In this paper, we discuss the origins of the prominent features of AOS devices from the viewpoint of materials science of AOS.\nIndex Terms—**Amorphous oxide semiconductor (AOS), defect,**\ndoping mechanism, electronic structure, thin-film transistor (TFT).\nI N LATE 2004, the authors reported that amorphous InGaZnO (a-IGZO) produces high mobility, flexible and transparent thin-film transistors (TFTs) (Fig. 1) . These families of oxide semiconductors are now called amorphous oxide semiconductors (AOSs) and studied for large-area devices such as TFT back planes in flat-panel displays (FPDs).\nAOS TFTs exhibit superior characteristics such as field-effect mobilities cm V s , which are sufficiently large for driving organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays and large-area liquid-crystal displays (LCDs) , and operate This paper, originally scheduled for this special issue, was inadvertently published in an earlier issue (Vol. 5, no. 7, pp.. 273–278, July 2009).\nManuscript received March 05, 2009; revised April 06, 2009.

The first AOS TFT using a-IGZO channel fabricated at RT on a PET\nsubstrate using ITO electrodes . It exhibited  of 8.3 cm -V  s- in the virgin state, which was almost maintained after bending tests at a curvature of 30 mm.\nat low V owing to small subthreshold voltage swings ( value) of V decade (Fig. 2) even if these are fabricated at room temperature (RT) on plastic substrates without a defect passivation treatment.\nIn the first report, we deposited all the constituent layers in the TFT by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) because we usually use PLD due to its convenience for surveying thin film growth of complex oxides and to its good reproducibility of film chemical composition. It has also been demonstrated that production-compatible sputtering produces AOS TFTs having characteristics comparable to those of PLD channels . AOS TFTs also exhibit good short-range uniformity owing to their amorphous structures , and 410-kHz oscillation of integrated circuits have been demonstrated . Due to these superior properties, AOS and their devices have been studied intensively and many prototype active-matrix (AM) displays have been demonstrated, which include '' flexible black-and-white electronic papers (e-papers) , '' front-drive structure full-color e-papers\n, , '' QCIF OLED displays , flexible OLED displays fabricated on a 100-mm-thick stainless steel foil ,\n'' WXGA OLED displays , and '' XGA LCDs ,\nonly in these four years. Flexible devices such as flexible ringoscillators with propagation delay of 0.35 s per stage  and TFTs on paper  have also been developed. Now the main research focus is to find a way to attain improved long-term stability –; it is thought that sensitivity to adsorption and desorption of oxygen-, hydrogen- and water-related molecules and plasma treatment – are a drawback of AOS. On the other hand, new approaches that utilize this drawback to developing low-resistance contacts and homojunction/self-aligned TFTs have been proposed –.\nDespite the great progress in the device development, fundamental materials science of AOS has not been investigated intensively. In this paper, we present a review on fundamental physics of AOSs along with additional unpublished data in order to clarify the origins of the afore-mentioned prominent features of AOS TFTs.\nIi. What Is The Real Advantage Of Oxide Semiconductors?\nIn these years, many oxide-based optoelectronic devices have been developed. The first ultraviolet (UV) LED using an oxide light-emitting layer was reported in 2000 by employing an n-type ZnO/p-type SrCu O heterojunction . ZnO has been studied intensively also for channel layers in TFTs because ZnO TFTs exhibit better performances than hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) TFTs (e.g., ,  and these may be fabricated at RT . However, the channels of ZnO TFTs are polycrystalline even if deposited at RT, and, therefore, the field-effect mobilities and long-term stability suffer from grain-boundary problems, which is similar to polycrystalline silicon (p-Si) TFTs. Although single-crystalline ZnO TFTs exhibit large of 40 cm V s , we should consider what is the real advantage of the oxide devices compared to conventional semiconductor technology if we intend to apply them to practical devices. As oxides have electronic structures and opto-electronic properties very different from those of the conventional semiconductors, it would be difficult for oxides to compete with the conventional devices if their targets are the same. Therefore, we have to find a suitable killer application that only oxides can realize or oxides can find a clear advantage, as well as to develop a suitable material that possesses all the properties required for practical devices such as long-term stability, uniformity, and production compatibility.\nHere, we like to propose some approaches. An idea is to get into deep UV region because large bandgap is an inherent advantage of oxides. Ga O is a unique material that possesses both reasonably good electrical conductivity and a very large band gap of 4.9 eV, which have been applied to TFTs  and deep UV sensors . Another approach is to utilize natural nanostructures embedded in crystal structures of oxide semiconductors. CaO Al O C12A7 is a crystal composed of sub-nanometer-sized cages. It is converted to an inorganic metal, C12A7 e , by electron doping . C12A7 e has a small work function of 2.4 eV , and therefore has been applied to RT-operating field-electron emitters , improved electron injection electrodes for OLEDs  and so on.\nAnother important advantage would be the transparency of the oxide semiconductors because they have bandgaps larger than 3.0 eV. Transparent high-performance TFTs and AM-OLED displays have been reported using single-crystalline InGaO ZnO , AOSs  and ZnO channel TFTs .\nConsidering the development of AOS TFT technology, the most important feature of oxide semiconductors would be that they can fabricate TFTs operating with satisfactory good performances even if they are fabricated at RT, which makes a clear contrast with the conventional semiconductors such as Si because a-Si and p-Si need to be passivated with hydrogen to produce operating TFTs and solar cells.\nIii. Electronic Structures Of Oxides\nThe difference between oxide semiconductors and Si can be understood from their electronic structures. This is important also for understanding the drawback and the advantage of oxides. It would be a common sense that compound semiconductors with strong ionic bonds are not suitable for electronic devices because they easily form defects, which causes the poor long-term stability and the difficulty in carrier doping due to the self-compensation effect, which is known e.g., for the case of ZnSe. Similar drawbacks are seen also in ZnO; producing stable p-type ZnO is very difficult and ZnO TFTs suffer from stability issues. Recent study has revealed that the instability comes largely from grain boundary effects. In addition, as known for p-Si TFTs, grain boundaries also deteriorate short-range uniformity seriously. On the other hand, AOSs are free from the grain boundary effects owing to their amorphous structures. However, in turn, amorphous semiconductors in general exhibit very deteriorated properties compared to their crystalline phases, which is actually the case for silicon because intrinsic crystalline Si\n(c-Si) exhibits an electron mobility of 1500 cm V s but the mobility is deteriorated to cm V s in a-Si:H. Therefore, it had been believed that amorphous materials can not have large mobility due to the strong scattering by the disordered structures. This misunderstanding was corrected by the finding of large-mobility highly-doped AOS in 1996 , . Here, we show that this advantage of AOS benefits from the strong ionicity of oxides, which was believed to be the drawback of oxides.\nHereafter, we briefly introduce the electronic structures specific to oxide semiconductors (note that these discussions are limited to oxides of main-group metals because unfilled orbitals in transition metal ions often form Fermi levels and alters the following discussion largely).\nFig. 3 shows crystal structures of representative semiconductors, Si, GaAs, and ZnO, which are superimposed by iso-surfaces of wave functions of conduction band minimums (CBMs) and valence band maximums (VBMs).\nFor example in Si, CBM and VBM are made of anti-bonding and bonding states of Si hybridized orbitals and its bandgap is formed of the energy splitting of the levels [Fig. 4(a)]. By contrast, because oxides have strong ionicity, CBM and VBM are usually formed of different ionic species as visually seen in Fig. 3. Although the CBM of GaAs still have large contributions of both the cation and the anion, the VBMs of GaAs and ZnO are formed almost solely by the anions (i.e., the iso-surfaces of the VBM wave functions are concentrated on the As and O ions). In the case of ZnO, which has the strongest ionicity among these semiconductors, even the CBM is made mainly by the cation although the anions still show some contribution. This can be understood from the Madelung potential. When a metal atom and an oxygen atom are apart in vacuum, the energy levels of the highest occupied atomic orbitals (HOAO) are not different largely as illustrated in Fig. 4(b), and they are stable in the neutral atom states. When they come close, charge transfer occurs due to the different electron affinities. As explained above, the neutral states are more stable in vacuum without an extra interaction, but the ionized ions form negative electrostatic potential at the\ncation site and positive potential at the anion sites (Madelung potential), which consequently stabilizes the ionized states in ionic materials [see Fig. 4(c)]. The Madelung potential lowers the energy levels in the oxygen ions and raises those in the metal cations [the arrows in Fig. 4(c)]. Therefore, CBM is mainly made of the empty orbitals of the metal cation and VBM is of fully-occupied O 2p orbitals. Thus, the large bandgap and the transparency for human eyes of oxide semiconductors come from the large Madelung potential.\nOwing to such the electronic structure, transparent conductive oxides (TCOs) such as ZnO, SnO and tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) have rather small electron effective masses 0.25–0.35 is the rest mass of electron) and reasonably large electron mobilities cm V s . The CBMs of these TCOs are mainly made of the orbitals of the heavy metal cations, which have large spatial sizes and spread almost spherically. The large size of the orbitals form largely hybridized CBM with large band dispersion, which is the reason for the small electron effective mass.\nThe above electronic structure explains why AOSs can have large electron mobilities even in the amorphous structures.\nAs explained above, conventional amorphous semiconductors such as a-Si:H exhibit much deteriorated carrier transport properties than associated crystalline materials. This is because the chemical bonds in the covalent semiconductors are made of or orbitals that have strong spatial directivity. Therefore, the strained chemical bonds in amorphous structures form rather deep and high-density localized states below CBM and\nabove VBM, causing carrier trapping [Fig. 5(a) and (b)]. By contrast, as CBMs of oxides are made of spherically extended orbitals of metals, and their overlaps with neighboring metal orbitals are not altered largely by disordered amorphous structures; therefore, electronic levels of CBM are insensitive to local strained bonds, and electron transport is not affected significantly [Fig. 5(c) and (d)]. This is a reason why AOSs exhibit large electron mobilities even in amorphous structures.\nIv. Atomic And Electronic Structures\nAs explained in the previous section, the spatial overlap of the orbitals of metal cations is very important to design high-mobility oxide semiconductors. Fig. 6 illustrates the structures of oxide semiconductors related to a-IGZO including crystalline In O and crystalline InGaZnO (c-IGZO). The CBM is formed mainly by In ions [see the wave function drawn in Fig. 6(d)] and are responsible for their large mobilities . The neighboring In ions are connected by edge-sharing network of InO octahedra (drawn by red polyhedra); the edge-sharing structure contributes to reducing the In—In distances compared to cornersharing structures, as known in the crystal chemistry. Fig. 6(c)\nshows a structure model of a-IGZO determined by extended X-ray absorption fine structures (EXAFS), classic molecular dynamics (MD), and first-principles density functional theory\n(DFT) . It shows that the edge-sharing networks of InO\npolyhedra are retained even in the disordered structure ( is smaller than 6 as will be shown).\nFig. 7 shows structure characterizations of a-IGZO. In X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, a-IGZO films do not exhibit sharp diffraction peaks assignable to a crystalline phase but have two halos around 32 and 56 'a-IGZO(meas)' in Fig. 7(a)]. These are different largely from those of a-Si:H (22 and 52 ,\n'a-Si:H') and glass (22 , \"glass\"), and can be used for determining the amorphous phase. The halo positions of a-IGZO\nare reproduced well by the XRD pattern simulated based on the structure model of - InGaZnO built by MD in \n('a-IGZO(sim)'), showing that the a-IGZO model is supported also by XRD. It should be noticed that the position of the strongest peak in c-IGZO ('c-IGZO(sim)') does not correspond to that in a-IGZO. High-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM) images in Fig. 7(c) and (d) and electron diffraction (TED) images (insets) provide more reliable short-range structures. Fig. 7(c) shows that -InGaO ZnO\n![3_image_3.png](3_image_3.png) crystalline oxide; and (d) amorphous oxide.\n(c-IGZO5) has a clear layered structure composed of an alternate stacking of In-O layers and (Zn,Ga)-O layers , which are similar to -InGaO ZnO in Fig. 6(b). Density of a thin film is obtained by X-ray reflectivity spectrum (XRR) as shown in Fig. 7(b). It provides the density of the a-IGZO film to be 6.1 g cm (note that this value is different from ), which is smaller than that of c-IGZO (6.379 g cm , estimated from the crystal structure in Power Diffraction Pattern Database (PDF) \\# 38–1104).\n(i.e., In-O, Zn-O, and Ga-O) and the second nearest-neighbor\n(2nd NN) (In-(In,Ga,Zn)) ions in a-IGZO films with various chemical compositions obtained by EXAFS analyses. It shows that the NN distances are not changed by the chemical composition change. While, the 2nd NN In-(In,Ga,Zn) distances decrease with increasing the In content, which is accompanied by the increase in the portion of the edge-sharing network of InO\npolyhedra (Fig. 9) and would be associated with the increase in the mobility to some extent. A similar trend in a coordination structure is reported also for amorphous In O ZnO films , . This trend is consistent with the above discussion that CBM in a-IGZO are mainly made of In orbitals and the In-In distances affect the CBM dispersion and consequently the electron mobility.\nHere, it should be noted that these EXAFS analyses give unphysically small coordination numbers (CNs) for the 2nd NN\nions; e.g., the In-In CNs are 0.7–0.9 as seen in Fig. 8. This would be due to the limitation of EXAFS analyses for amorphous materials and these values are not real, because the CNs obtained by DFT (Fig. 10) gives more reasonable values, e.g.,\nthe In-In CNs 3 at the In-In distances larger than 0.37 nm for a-IGZO with the In:Ga:Zn chemical composition ratio of 1:1:1. This discrepancy comes from the decoherence of the EXAFS\nsignal caused by the disordered coordination structures. Combining with the a-IGZO model built by DFT having the chemical unit of InGaZnO , it is possible to extract twelve EXFAS spectra originating from each In ion. Fig. 11(a) shows that the 12 EXFAS spectra thus simulated from the a-IGZO model. It clearly shows that the phases of the EXAFS signals exhibit significant shifts among these simulated spectra, which causes the decoherence of the observed EXFAS spectrum especially at the energies 28150 eV. Fig. 11(b) indicates that the EXAFS spectrum obtained from one In site does not reproduce the measured one, but Fig. 11(c) shows that the convolution of the 12 In\nsignals reproduces well the measured radial distribution function (RDF), which further supports the reliability of the a-IGZO\nV. T Ransport P Roperties\nAs written in Introduction, a-IGZO TFTs exhibit reasonably large mobilities > 10 cm 2 /(V . s). It is possible to obtain fur-\nther larger mobilities by choosing proper chemical composition and annealing condition, etc., , , . Fig. 12 summarizes relationship among chemical composition, mobility, and carrier density in the In2O3-Ga2O3-ZnO system for films deposited at RT. It shows that larger mobilities are obtained in In-rich a-IGZO films, which is consistent with the above discussion on the structure of a-IGZO. While, incorporation of Ga decreases carrier density and mobility. The largest mobility of 39 cm 2 /(V - s) is obtained for Zn-doped In 2 O 3 (a-IZO) with the carrier density of 1 × 10 20 cm − 3 . However, we found that it is difficult to control and maintain a low carrier density, which is necessary for good TFT operation, for Ga-free or Ga-poor films, as seen in Fig. 13. It indicates that the incorporation of Ga is important to obtain stable films and TFTs, and this is a reason why a-IGZO with the chemical composition of InGaZnO 4 has widely been studied for TFTs and displays although the mobility is not the largest.\nA characteristic feature of AOS is found in the relationship between Hall mobility ( µ e ) and carrier density ( N e ) as seen in Fig. 14; i.e., µ c increases with increasing N c for all the IGZO films including crystalline films , –. This trend is opposite to those of simple crystalline semiconductors because µ e of crystalline semiconductors usually decreases with increasing N e due to enhanced impurity scattering effects.\nAnother characteristic feature is found in the μ e —temperature\n( T ) and N e − T relations for c-InGaO 3 (ZnO) 5 (c-IGZO5) and a-IGZO in Fig. 15. It shows that N e is already degenerated at N e > 10 17 cm 3 for c-IGZO and a-IGZO, indicating that the Fermi levels ( EF ) are already in the conduction band (CB).\nAlthough N e is degenerated, µ e still shows thermally-excited behaviors and transits to degeneration at N e ≥ 3 × 10 17 cm − 3\ncm 3 for a-IGZO. The therfor c-IGZO5 and > 4 × 10 17 mally-activated behaviors in degenerated semiconductors suggest that transport of free carriers in CB is limited by potential barriers above CBM.\nThese are explained well by Adler's percolation conduction model  as seen in the good fitting results in Fig. 16. It assumes that carrier transport is controlled by distributed potential barriers above mobility edge with the average height of Ecenter and the energy distribution of ∆ E . These values are summarized in Fig. 17(a), showing that Ecenter are 30–100 meV and\n∆ E are 5–20 meV. This analysis also provides the donor levels ED , which are estimated to be 0.11 eV below the CBM for a-IGZO and 0.10 –0.15 eV for c-IGZO films (data not shown).\nWe like to note that, due to this feature, AOS TFTs exhibit an\napparently inconsistent trend in relationships between TFT mobilities and the donor density in the channel as will be discussed in Section X.\nbuilt using these results and the data obtained by the other observations described in the Sections VI–XIII. Simply speaking, the CB structure is explained well by the Tauc-Lorentz (TL)\nmodel  but non-localized tail-states exist in the subgap region , –, . As-deposited a-IGZO film deposited\nat RT has extra gap states ~ 0.2 eV below CBM, which is related to hysteresis in capacitance ( C )–voltage ( V ) characteristics and TFT characteristics . Hard X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (HX-PES) revealed that high-density electron traps exist just above VBM with the energy range of N 1.5 eV\n, which would be the reason why a-IGZO TFTs (and probably other AOS TFTs and crystalline oxide TFTs) have never operated in p-channel TFT mode.\nVi.  B Andgap And S Ubgap S Tates\nThe optical spectra of a-IGZO are well described by optical models incorporating a TL model and an Urbach tail .\nFig. 18(a) shows transmission ( T ) and reflectance ( R ) spectra measured on an undoped high-quality (HQ) a-IGZO film (the notation of HQ will be explained in Section VII) along with the results fi tted to this optical model. In the subgap region close to the optical bandgap Eg ~ 3.0 eV, a wide Urbach-type subgap absorption exists with an Urbach energy of ~ 0.16 eV.\nLorentz-type absorptions should often be considered for localized sub-gap states, but these are not essential for the HQ\na-IGZO film, indicating that the optical absorption coefficient α in the subgap region is smaller than 10 2-3 cm 1 . As shown in Fig. 18(c), α for doped a-IGZO films increases with decreasing the photon energy in the infared (IR) region below 1.5 eV, which is known as the free carrier absorption (FCA)\nand described by the Drude model. The good fitting result in Fig. 18(c) substantiates that a single Drude model reproduces well the observed spectrum, indicating that the carrier transport in a-IGZO is explained by the nearly-free electron model with a single momentum relaxation time τ . In this case, the plasma frequency E P of 0.35 eV and τ of 3.8 fs were obtained, which gives the electron effective mass m e of 0.36 m e by using the carrier density obtained by Hall measurements.\nm is obtained also from the band filling effect (Burstein-\nMoss (BM) shift, ∆ E g ) as shown in Fig. 19. It shows that both\nthe c-IGZO and a-IGZO films show the bandgap widening effects upon heavy carrier doping. The rn * obtained from ∆ E g are 0.30–0.37 m e , which are consistent with those obtained from FCA, supporting that these analyses and values are reliable, the bandgap widening effects come from the band filling effect, and the conduction band structure is rather rigid even in the heavily-doped films. But if we look at Fig. 19(b) more carefully, the ∆ E g − N 2 / 3 relation, which is expected from the free electron theory if carrier mass is constant, deviates from a straight line, suggesting that the fundamental bandgap is narrowed by ∼ 30 meV when the carrier density is 10 20 cm − 3 .\nFig. 20 summarizes dielectric functions ( E 1 + j E 2 , where j denotes the imaginary unit) of various a-IGZO films along with that of c-IGZO obtained by the optical analyses explained above\n. It shows that the a-IGZO films have larger ε 1 values (i.e.,\nlarger refractive indices) than the c-IGZO film, and the ε 1 values are also different among the a-IGZO films. The origins are not clear yet, but it would be attributed to the different chemical composition as shown in Table I . Increases in the relative content of the heavy In ion would result in the larger refractive indexes despite that the weight densities of a-IGZO films are smaller by ~ 5% than that of c-IGZO as explained for Fig. 7(b). These a-IGZO films were doped to > 10 19 cm − 3 and, therefore, the Drude-type IR absorptions are observed in the E 1 and ε 2 spectra at photon energies < 1.0 eV. In the subgap region close to E g , large subgap absorptions are observed for the as-deposited LQ (LQ-as) and the annealed LQ (LQ-ann) films, which will be discussed in connection to HX-PES spectra in Section VII.\nVII. EFFECTS OF FILM QUALITY AND THERMAL ANNEALING\nFig. 21 compares carrier transport properties of a-IGZO films with different film quality , which were deposited using different ablation laser powers for the PLD deposition processes.\nThe a-IGZO film deposited at a low laser fluence of 2 J/cm 2 has a low µ e of 2.5 cm 2 /(V  s) at RT and exhibits the large temperature dependence (low-quality (LQ) a-IGZO). The a-IGZO film deposited at a high laser fluence of 9 J/cm 2 has a larger µ e of 15 cm 2 /(V - s) (high-quality (HQ) a-IGZO). These films were annealed at 400 °C and compared with the as-deposited films. Fig. 21 shows that thermal annealing at 400 1 C for 0.5 h in vacuum at ∼ 10 − 3 Pa does not change N e largely for all the cases. While, µ e of the as-deposited LQ film is largely increased to ~ 10 cm 2 /(V - s) and becomes close to that of the as-deposited HQ film. In the case of the HQ film, thermal annealing slightly improves µ e to ∼ 19cm 2 /(V  s).\nFig. 20(b) shows HX-PES spectra, which exhibits additional, non-negligible signals in the deep subgap region above the VBM with the bandwidth ~ 1.5 eV . The subgap DOS is the largest in the as-deposited LQ film (LQ-as). It is reduced to almost a half by the thermal annealing. The subgap DOSs are also observed for the HQ films, but the amounts are much smaller. It should be noticed that the bandwidth and the change of their amounts by the thermal annealing are similar to those of the subgap absorption in Fig. 20(a). These results indicate that the origin of the subgap absorption is the subgap DOS existing above the VBM. The subgap DOSs above the VBMs were estimated to be 9.3 × 10 20  cm − 3 for the as-deposited HQ film (HQ-as) and 2.6×10 21 cm −3 for the LQ-as film. The thermal annealing decreased them to 5.0 × 10 20 cm −3 and 1.6 × 10 21 cm − 3 , respectively.\nThe improvement in the Hall mobilities in Fig. 21(a) looks correlated with the changes in the subgap DOS, but these DOSs\n  \\begin{tabular}{l l l l} \\hline \\hline $\\phantom{-}$ & 0.193/4 & 0.193/5 & 0.218/6 & 0.330 \\\\ 218.9 & 0.192/4.0 & 0.191/5.0 & 0.212/4.8 & 0.314 \\\\ 220.5 & & & & \\\\ 139.4 & 0.193/4.2 & 0.191/5.3 & 0.212/5.0 & 0.325 \\\\ 131.6 & 0.193/4.3 & 0.191/5.1 & 0.212/5.6 & 0.320 \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular}  \nare located at 1 eV deeper than (note that is located above CBM because is degenerated). It suggests that such the deep and fully-occupied subgap DOSs have less important effects for carrier transport although the increase in the scattering centers deteriorate the Hall mobility to a some extent.\nOn the other hand, the observed subgap DOSs above the VBM is essentially important for achieving p-channel operation of AOS TFTs. There have no oxide TFTs operating in an inversion p-channel mode including ZnO and a-IGZO TFTs. A possible explanation is that the subgap DOSs pins the Fermi level at eV above VBM under a reverse gate bias operation of a TFT because the amounts of the subgap DOSs are more than two orders of magnitude larger than the hole density inducible by in a usual TFT structure.\nTable II summarizes structure change induced by thermal annealing, where the film thickness' were determined by optical analyses in Fig. 20, and the coordination structures by EXAFS\nas explained in Section IV. It shows the film thickness is almost unchanged for the HQ film while it is decreased by 5.6%\nfor the LQ film. The NN distances are not affected by the film quality and the thermal annealing, which is similar to the result on chemical composition dependence in Fig. 8. On the other hand, the 2nd NN In-In distance is shortened from 0.325 to 0.320 nm by thermal annealing in the LQ film. These results indicate that the atomic structure in the as-deposited LQ films was relaxed so as to form a denser packing structure of the ions by the thermal annealing. It should also be noted that the In-In distances are the shortest in the HQ film.\nViii. Formation Of Defects And Electrons By Annealing\nIt is now recognized that thermal annealing at 300 C improves hysteresis and stability of AOS TFTs. It should also be noticed that annealing atmosphere is important to control properties of AOS films and TFTs. Fig. 22(a) shows that the amorphous structure of a-IGZO films is stable up to 500 C, while\ncrystalline peak features appear around 35 at 500 C, indicating the a-IGZO start crystallizing . As explained in Fig. 21, thermal annealing does not change of the HQ a-IGZO film largely, while that of the LQ a-IGZO film is improved by a factor of four. Fig. 22(b) shows that the Hall mobility of the as-deposited LQ a-IGZO film start increasing sharply at 200 C\nand saturates at 500 C, where crystallization starts .\nThis result indicates that the improvement of the Hall mobility is not associated with crystallization but with structural relaxation by keeping the amorphous structure. The structural relaxation starts at a rather low temperature of C, but higher temperatures, e.g., 300 C would be necessary to enhance the structure relaxation.\nFig. 23(a) summarizes changes of TFT characteristics by thermal annealing at 400 C in various atmospheres . The data at the H O Partial pressure ratio are for unannealed HQ a-IGZO TFT (closed circles) and dry O annealed HQ a-IGZO TFT (open circles), respectively. The others are for HQ a-IGZO TFTs annealed under varied (wet-annealed).\nIt shows that the thermal annealing not only improves the TFT characteristics but also reduces the distributions of the TFT\nparameters (see data in ). The wet annealing under between 7.3 and 19.7% is most effective to obtain the best TFT\ncharacteristics including the smallest value, the largest , and the narrowest distributions.\nIn-situ measurements of DC conductivity curves provide information about the formation processes and the formation energies of defects and donors. Fig. 23(b) shows that the initial increase in with increasing from RT is associated with thermal excitation of electrons from donor levels. While, the increase in is enhanced at higher temperatures. It is ascribed to formation of defects that generate free electrons because the apparent activation energies are too large. The effect of annealing atmosphere is observed at higher temperatures. In N , increases with increasing and the high was kept even after cooling down to RT. It indicates that the N annealing creates donor defects and the defects are not annihilated. While in O atmospheres, starts decreasing at 300 C and becomes smaller than the initial value after cooled down to RT.\nThis result proves that re-oxidation of a-IGZO needs somewhat\nhigh temperatures, e.g., C and an oxidation atmosphere. This observation is consistent with the first paragraph of this section; thermal annealing at C have been employed for producing prototype displays and for obtaining improved stability in films and TFTs.\nFig. 23(b) also provides information about defect formation energy. Combining the data obtained by thermal desorption spectra (TDS, see data in ), we speculate that the increase in during the thermal annealing comes from chemical reactions, such as M-OH M-OH -O- ,\nwhere denotes a metal cation and an ionized oxygen deficiency. In such a case, it is known that the formation energy of is connected to the activation energy of free electron concentration by ,\nwhere denotes the number of free electrons generated from one . are estimated to be 3.0–7.2 eV from the apparent activation energy of . These values appear consistent with those obtained by first-principles calculations for SiO 8.10 eV , HfO 9.32 eV , ZnO (0.9–3.7 eV) (see references in ), and a-IGZO (3.3–4.7 eV) (to be discussed for Fig. 30).\nAs the last of this section, we like to note that low-temperature thermal annealing is also effective to alter electron densities in AOS. Fig. 24 shows that low temperature annealing, e.g., at 150 C introduces 10 cm of free electrons and the effect of annealing levels off already at 200 C. Fig. 25 shows that not only H annealing but also H implantation at RT generates free electrons. The implantation at the dose of cm increased the conductivity to 140 S/cm, and caused FCA in the IR region (Fig. 24(a)) and the BM shift in the Tauc' plot (Fig. 24(b)). Combining the conductivity, the optical analyses ( eV, fs), and the BM shift eV , was estimated to be 0.44 and 5.5 10 cm . In Section XII, DFT calculations will show that incorporation of hydrogen into a-IGZO forms O-H bonds and produces free electrons.\nIx. Effects Of High Fermi Level In Aos\nWe observed subgap states in Sections VI and VII in optical and HX-PES spectra; however, these come from subgap DOSs closer to VBM and would not affect electron transport and operation characteristics of n-channel AOS TFTs largely because in AOSs are located close to CBM irrespective of the large bandgaps eV. Note that in a-IGZO is estimated by a simple way upon an assumption that the CB structure is expressed by non-degenerated free-electron-like band, which is confirmed by DFT , and the film is not degenerated. As the effective DOS of CB is estimated to be 5.2 10 cm from the observed of a-IGZO , is estimated from , where is the Boltzmann constant and the energy level of CBM, using measured\n. It gives eV for cm , which would be the minimum value obtained for a-IGZO to date, and 0.16 eV for cm , which would be used for depletion mode a-IGZO TFTs. Device simulations indicate that the energy region that affects on-operation of a-IGZO TFTs is down to 0.8 eV from .\nThis estimation tells that existence of electron trap states deeper than 0.8 eV from does not affect electron transport and on-operation characteristics of AOS TFTs although less significant indirect effects should exist. Actually, we observed that Hall mobility of the HQ film and the LQ film are not different largely after thermal annealing (Fig. 21) although the subgap DOS above VBM observed by HX-PES is three times larger for the annealed LQ film (5.0 10 cm ) than for the annealed HQ film (1.6 10 cm ). It is also recognized that\n![10_image_0.png](10_image_0.png)\n![10_image_1.png](10_image_1.png)\n![10_image_2.png](10_image_2.png)\nthermal annealing at 300 C in the same atmosphere produces TFTs with very similar operation characteristics irrespective of the quality and the carrier density of unannealed films. That means, thermal annealing effectively reduces electron traps near CBM that affect electron transport and TFT operation, but the annealing temperature is not enough to annihilate the inactive defect states near VBM. Fortunately, because AOS\nTFTs are targeted for n-channel TFTs at present, the existence of the deep, fully-occupied inactive states are screened by the high and can be detached from discussions on TFT\nWe have investigated subgap states that are located close to CBM and affect directly to the TFT characteristics by device simulations  and capacitance-voltage (C-V) analyses . The device simulations using TCAD (ATLAS, SILVACO)\nproved that a simple model of a-Si:H, which employs an Urbach-like tail DOS, a deep spread DOS, and a constant mobility, reproduces well the on-operation characteristics of a-IGZO TFTs having different threshold voltages. The solid lines in Fig. 26(a) show the subgap DOSs extracted by the TCAD simulations for annealed a-IGZO TFTs, where two kinds of TFTs operating in depletion and enhancement modes, respectively, were employed. It shows that the subgap DOSs are 2–3 orders of magnitude smaller than that a-Si:H in the vicinity of , which are the most important region for on-operation of n-channel TFTs. In the deeper energy region down to 0.8 eV\nbelow , the subgap DOSs are the orders of 10 - cm eV\nand does not have a Gaussian-type DOS, which is observed in low-quality or doped a-Si:H. The observation of small subgap DOSs explains the high mobility, the low operation voltage and small values of a-IGZO TFTs. Comparing the two TFTs, we found that the depletion-type TFT exhibited a larger of 9.19 cm V s than that of the enhancement-type TFT\n7.84cm V s although the subgap traps are larger as observed in Fig. 26(a) and also in the values (0.224 and 0.104 V/decade, respectively, which correspond to subgap DOSs of 6.0 10 and 1.6 10 cm eV ). This can be explained by the fact that in AOS increases with increasing (Fig. 14). As the depletion-type TFT has a negative threshold voltage and higher donor density in the channel, the channel intrinsic mobility is considered larger than that in the enhancement-type TFT. The device simulations provided the intrinsic mobilities of 11.9 and 8.57 cm V s , respectively, which are consistent with this discussion.\nOn the other hand, the energy widths of the tail states near CBM are rather wide, 0.08–0.14 eV, which are close to the Urbach energy observed by the optical spectra (Fig. 18). We consider these large widths are not real because the constant mobility model is not accurate for AOSs due to the fact that increases with . We, therefore, performed C-V measurements using actual TFT structures because these provide subgap DOS\nwithout an assumption about the mobility model. The results are shown by the dashed and the dotted lines in Fig. 26(a), showing similar trends to the TCAD analyses but lower subgap DOSs\n![11_image_0.png](11_image_0.png)\nin the deep region. The widths of the CB tail states are very small, 0.013–0.1 eV. This result substantiates that although the VB tail states distribute in a wide range of eV, the CB tail states are very narrow in a-IGZO. Jeon and co-workers recently reported that the subgap DOS observed by C-V measurements explains well the TFT characteristics if a -dependent mobility model is considered .\nThis C-V measurements provided information of subgap DOS for unannealed TFT fabricated at RT, which showed the large hysteresis shown in Fig. 26(b). Corresponding to it, the unannealed a-IGZO TFT exhibited extra subgap DOSs 0.1–0.3 eV below , which is annihilated by the thermal annealing.\nHowever, as the energy level of the extra DOSs would be too shallow, it seems difficult to understand it as the origin of the slow hysteresis.\nXi. Origin Of Small Subgap Dos In Oxide Semiconductors\nAs explained above and in Introduction, a clear advantage of oxide semiconductors is that subgap DOSs are very small compared to conventional covalent semiconductors, and consequently oxide TFTs operate with reasonable performances even if they are fabricated at low temperatures without any defect passivation treatment. This feature is also explained by the electronic structure of oxides discussed in Section III (chemical bonding view). Fig. 27(a) shows a schematic electronic structure of a dangling bond in silicon. As explained for Fig. 4(a), the bandgap of Si is made of energy splitting of bonding—antibonding states; therefore, the energy level of the non-bonding state is located near the middle of the bandgap. Because it is occupied by one electron, such mid-gap defects trap both an electron and a hole and deteriorate TFT operation for both nand p-channel TFTs. This is the reason why hydrogen passivation is necessary to wipe out the midgap states into CB and VB\n(Fig. 27(b)). In the case of oxides, CB and VB are made mainly of different ionic species; therefore, even an oxygen deficiency is formed, the non-bonding state of a neighboring metal cation is located in CBM or near CBM (Fig. 27(c)). In this case, generates two free electrons in CB and works as a shallow donor, which is a well-known mechanism for doping in n-type TCOs. However, as revealed by theoretical calculations, such a mechanism is valid not for all TCOs and oxide semiconductors because the energy levels of such states are often deepened even closer to VBM (Fig. 27(d)). That is, first-principles calculations tell that in ZnO forms a deep fully-occupied state and can not be a source of free electrons . This situation would easily be understood by an analogy of color center in very wide bandgap oxides such as MgO. In this case, formation of releases two electrons, but these electrons are trapped at the site, which is visually seen in Fig. 27(e) and (f). In this case, the large space of the oxygen vacancy (note that the O has a large ionic radius of 0.14 nm) forms a quantum-dot-like electronic state at the site, which traps electrons.\nXii. Defects And Doping\nElectronic structures of c-IGZO have been reported in refs.\n– and those of a-IGZO in –. As for the formation energy of a-IGZO (i.e., the difference of DFT total energies between c-IGZO and a-IGZO), eV per ion (i.e.,\nkJ mol) is obtained. The small positive value would be consistent with the fact that the amorphous phase is stable up to 500 C in a-IGZO [see Fig. 22(a)].\nFig. 28 shows the electronic structure of stoichiometric a-IGZO. Hereafter, we use pseudo-band structures although the band theory is not applicable to disordered systems that do not have structural periodicity, because we can easily know from band dispersion whether a specific electronic state is localized or delocalized; i.e., small band dispersion tells that it is a localized state. In the stoichiometric a-IGZO case, the dispersion of CBM is reasonably large and is consistent with the good electron transport in a-IGZO. estimated from the band dispersion is m , which is somewhat smaller than the observed values m probably due to the polaron effect . No subgap state is found in the pseudo-band structure irrespective of the amorphous structure, which is consistent with the low subgap DOSs observed and the chemical bonding view explained in Section XI. Here we like to note that these features are similar to c-IGZO.\n![12_image_1.png](12_image_1.png)\nOn the other hand, a large difference from c-IGZO is found in the very vicinity of VBM because an isolated band forms the VBM [Fig. 29(b)] and the other deeper VB bands also have very small dispersions [e.g., see Fig. 29(c)]. This result indicates that the VB states are almost localized in a-IGZO although that in c-IGZO is more delocalized. It is speculated that the strongly-localized states are formed because the disordered atomic configuration in a-IGZO breaks the coherent hybridization of O 2p orbitals that mainly form VB in oxides. In addition, distribution of electrostatic potentials (i.e., the Madelung potential) at the oxygen ion sites gives rise to the distribution of energy levels of the O 2p orbitals, resulting in the formation of the isolated VBM band. In Section VII, we observed a large subgap DOS above VBM by HX-PES and suggested that oxide TFTs have never operated in an inversion p-channel mode due to the subgap DOS.\nHowever, the very small dispersion of the VBM bands predicts that holes are strongly localized; therefore, even if the subgap states are completely removed, hole devices would not exhibit good performances for a-IGZO as long as similar atomic configuration and electronic structure are retained.\nThe electronic states of the oxygen-deficient a-IGZO are classified into two groups . One group forms deep, fully-occupied states at 0.4–1 eV above the VB bands (Fig. 29(a)). In this case, the electron density at the HOMO level is concentrated at the site as visually seen in Fig. 29(b) and (c), which is similar to the color center in MgO in Fig. 27(e). Another important feature found in the pseudo-band structure is that the dispersion of the LUMO band at eV (indicated by ) is decreased significantly from that of the CBM dispersion in the stoichiometric a-IGZO in Fig. 28(a), suggesting that the formation of a deep level state breaks the coherency of the CBM band and forms a localized state near CBM. We speculate that this would be a candidate for electron traps near observed by the device simulations and the C-V measurements in Section X , .\nThe formation energies of these deep oxygen deficiencies are calculated as the differences of the DFT total energies between the initial states and the final states of the reaction equation InGaZnO In Ga ZnO O .\nIt gave the formation energies of 3.3–4.7 eV as seen in Fig. 30. It also shows relationships between the value and the coordination structure around the . We can see a trend that\n![12_image_0.png](12_image_0.png)\n![12_image_2.png](12_image_2.png)\nare small if three In ions are coordinated to , while becomes larger with increasing CN of Ga ions. If no Ga ion is coordinated [see for Fig. 30(b)], a half of such have values smaller than 3.6 eV. It indicates that the coordination of Ga ions suppress the formation of and stabilizes the film atomic structure and electrical properties.\nThis is consistent with the discussion in Section V that incorporation of Ga into an In-Zn-O system is necessary to obtain good controllability and stability in electrical properties (i.e., electron density) of a-IGZO films.\nIt should be noted that not all oxygen deficiency form such a deep trap levels mentioned for Fig. 29. The other oxygen deficiency group forms a shallow donor state as seen in Figs. 31(b)\nand 32(a). In this case, the oxygen deficiency does not form a large free space, and therefore electrons cannot be trapped at a\n\" site,\" which results in the doping of free electrons to CB.\nThis difference implies that some large free space like a vacancy site is necessary to form an electron trap level deep in the band gap.\nIn Section VIII, we showed that incorporation of hydrogen by annealing and H implantation generates free electrons in a-IGZO. Fig. 32 shows the electronic structure of H-doped a-IGZO. We have calculated more than ten H-doped a-IGZO\nmodels started from different coordination of the H atoms, and found that the H atoms always form O-H bonds [Fig. 32(b)] with the bond lengths (0.099 nm in this case) close to that in H O (0.097 nm) in the relaxed structure obtained by DFT\nstructure relaxation calculations. is located eV above the CBM as seen in the pseudo-band structure [Fig. 32(a)) and the CBM wave function is delocalized over the material\n(Fig. 32(c)]. These indicate that the H doping results in electron doping through the reaction H (from outside) O\n(in a-IGZO) -OH (in a-IGZO) . A similar effect is\n![13_image_0.png](13_image_0.png)\nreported also for ZnO , . Because the doped H atoms form strong O-H bonds, the H doping would be strong and stable. Actually, we found by thermal desorption spectra (TDS)\nthat the chemical bonds in the wet O annealed a-IGZO is the most stable among the as-deposited, dry O annealed, and wet O annealed a-IGZO .\nXiii. Doping: Simple Counting Rule Applicable To Ionic Amorphous Semiconductors\nLastly, we like to propose a simple method to understand doping in AOS. For covalent semiconductors such as Ge, Si and C, it is known that we can discuss doping based on the numbers of valence electrons and chemical bonds of the host-constituent atom and the dopant; e.g., each Si atom has four valence electrons and forms four chemical bonds, and therefore substitution by a P atom, which has five valence electrons, for the four-fold coordinated Si site leaves one free electron and causes electron doping. This concept is known to be valid also for a-Si:H as long as the coordination number of the dopant site is known.\nHowever, it is not applicable to amorphous oxides because an ionic bond does not always correspond to number of electrons shared with neighboring ions, and AOSs appear not to have a well-defined coordination structure as observed by EXAFS and DFT in Section IV. One sometimes says in relation to doping in amorphous oxide, 'addition of Al ions to -InGaZnO dopes free electrons because the Al ions are considered to substitute for the Zn ions,' but this explanation does not have a valid physical sense because the concept of 'substitution' cannot be defined in the structures of AOSs.\nFor such cases, we can employ a simple counting rule to understand the doping by addition of aliovalent impurity ions, which is valid for amorphous and crystalline ionic materials.\nAs explained in Section III, the constituent atoms in ionic materials may be considered to be ionized with their formal ionic charges, e.g., for Zn, for In and Ga, and for O atoms, where denotes the elementary electric charge. For H, we saw in Sections VIII and XII that H atoms form -OH\nbonds and are considered to be ionized to O H . The carrier polarity and density can be calculated from the charge neutrality condition; i.e., extra charges should be doped to keep the charge neutrality if the sum of the formal ionic charges of the constituent ions is not zero (note that the extra charges are not necessary to become free carriers because they can be trapped like as in Fig. 29). Using this rule, we know that stoichiometric -In Ga Zn O is intrinsic because the sum of the formal charges are zero, while Al-doped a-IGZO such as\n-In Ga Zn O Al leaves one electron per chemical unit of InGaZnO , which explains electron doping by Al addition if the left electron becomes a free electron. On the other hand, we should notice that Al doping does not always produce free electrons because if the material incorporates extra O ion and forms -In Ga Zn O Al , it keeps the charge neutrality and does not have an extra electron. It means that addition of aliovalent ions can be compensated by atomospheric oxygens existing during film deposition and post-deposition thermal annealing, and that addition of aliovalent ions is not essential for doping in amorphous oxides. For H doping, it is also understood by the same way; -In Ga Zn H\nneeds an extra electron doped in order to keep the charge neutrality. We should be careful to apply this rule if incorporated species form covalent bonds and/or molecules; e.g., if incorporation of excess O and H atoms form neutral O and H O\nmolecules, the formal charges of these atoms should be considered zero, which provides correct conclusion except for a small charge transfer effect (chemical doping) between the host material and electron-acceptor molecules.\nWe have reviewed what have been clarified for AOS especially from the viewpoints of materials science. Comparing with conventional semiconductors, the strong ionicity of AOSs is a very important factor to understand the superior carrier transport properties of AOSs; e.g., the large mobility in the amorphous structure comes from the fact that large spherical orbitals such as In form electron transport paths, and the strong ionic bonds do not form high-density electron traps in the bandgap. The low-density subgap trap is responsible for the small value and consequently the low operation voltages of AOS TFTs. To improve the stability of electrical properties, incorporation of Ga ions, which form stronger chemical bonds with oxygens, is important. Despite of these superior features, we should choose appropriate conditions for film deposition and post-deposition thermal annealing in order to produce good TFTs; e.g., TFTs deposited at a low temperature and/or with an inappropriate condition have larger defects, less stability and poor uniformity. The extra defects that affects electron transport and TFT\ncharacteristics are efficiently removed by thermal annealing at 300 C especially when an appropriate amount of water vapor is added to the annealing atmosphere, which also improves stability and uniformity. On the other hand, high-density defects may exist near VBM, but they are inactive for electron transport and n-channel TFT operation. It is considered that oxygen deficiencies play important roles in forming these defects and generating free electrons, but it depends strongly on the local coordination structure of the oxygen deficiency. To understand electron doping in AOS, incorporation of hydrogen should always be considered to be another origin of electron doping."

Unannealed TFTs showed rather large instability; i.e., large hysteresis in transfer curves (ΔVG> 0.8 V) and large positive threshold voltage shift (ΔVth> 10 V for 50 h tests at 5 µA) with deterioration of subthreshold voltage swing was observed. The instability for the unannealed TFT had a strong dependence on the stress atmosphere and the stress temperature, which suggests that trap states generated by the stress test is related to oxygen vacancy formed by breaking weak chemical bonds. Wet annealing improved stability; the hysteresis disappeared and the ΔVth was reduced to <2 V. The improvement is considered to be related to the reduction of weak chemical bonds by wet annealing with the strong oxidation power of water molecules.\n1. Introduction\nTransparent amorphous oxide semiconductors (TAOSs) such as aIn-Ga-Zn-O (a-IGZO) are expected for channel materials of thin-film transistors (TFTs) because they exhibit better TFT characteristics than those of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) and organic TFTs; e.g. a field-effect mobility exceeds ~10 cm2(Vs)−1 and off current is easily suppressed to <10−13 A even fabricated at room temperature\n(RT) with ohmic metal contacts [1–3]. Therefore, several applications to flat-panel displays and flexible devices such as active-matrix liquidcrystal displays (AMLCD), organic light-emitting diode displays (AMOLED) and electronic papers (e-paper) have been demonstrated using a-IGZO-TFTs as a driving/switching TFT .\nIt is widely known that a post-thermal annealing is effective to improve not only TFT characteristics (i.e., mobility and small subthreshold voltage swing (S)), but also their stability, which would originate from the reduction of subgap defect states in a-IGZO channel layer . Recently, we have reported that wet O2 annealing is more effective than dry O2 annealing to improve TFT characteristics including their uniformity . Therefore, most of the a-IGZO TFTs reported to date by companies are subjected to post-thermal annealing, and these exhibit good device characteristics such as a large mobility >10 cm2(Vs)−1, a small S value ~0.1 V/decade, and a large ON/OFF current ratio >1010, which satisfy the requirements for practical high-resolution AM-OLED and large-size AMLCD. Several prototype displays such as 12.1″ AM-OLED and 15″ AMLCD have already been demonstrated using a-IGZO TFTs for driving TFTs .\nTo date, the focus of the development research is shifting to more practical issues such as stability and reliability of TFT characteristics. In particular, threshold voltage (Vth) stability under voltage/current stress is important for flat-panel display applications because driving current is changed by Vth shifts and consequently pixel signal level/emission intensity is altered . Therefore, Vth stability against voltage/current stress for a-IGZO TFTs have been intensively studied [11–14]. Recently, we have found that the Vth shifts induced by constant current stress have multiple origins and large Vth shifts >10 V in unannealed a-IGZO TFTs are related to shallow subgap traps, which are annihilated by thermal annealing at 400 °C. Deep charged trap states remain even after the thermal annealing and cause small Vth shifts less than 2 V .\nTo further understand the origin of instability in a-IGZO TFTs under current stress, it is important to investigate the stability in a wide range of conditions such as different atmospheres and temperatures, because defects such as oxygen deficiency often cause electron trapping and doping in oxide semiconductors and their formation is sensitive to an atmosphere and temperature. In this work, we have investigated stability of a-IGZO (In:Ga:Zn=1:1:1) TFT under constant current stress with several atmospheres and at different temperatures.\n2. Experimental Detail 2.1. Tft Fabrication\nAll the a-IGZO (In:Ga:Zn= 1:1:1) films with thickness ~40 nm were deposited on thermal SiO2 (t ~ 150 nm)/n+-Si substrates by pulsed laser deposition with a KrF excimer laser (λ= 248 nm) at room temperature (RT). A sintered body of crystalline InGaZnO4 was used as a target. Oxygen partial pressure during deposition was set to\n~6.1–6.7 Pa. The a-IGZO channel regions were patterned by photolithography and lift-off. Then, thermal annealing was carried out at 400 °C for 1 h in dry or wet O2 atmospheres (hereafter referred to as\n'dry annealing' and 'wet annealing', respectively). The wet O2 gas was generated through deionized water at 60 °C, which temperature corresponds to the H2O partial pressure of 19.7% . Then source/drain electrode areas were defined by photolithography, and a stacked layer of Au and Ti was deposited by electron-beam evaporation at RT. The channel width (W) and length (L) were 300 and 50 μm, respectively.\n2.2. Tft Characterization\nTFT characteristics were measured by a semiconductor parameter analyzer at RT in dark. Saturation mobility (μsat) is extracted from IDS=WμsatCOX/2 L(VGS−Vth)\n2, where IDS is drain-source current, VGS\nis gate-source voltage, and COX is the gate insulator capacitance per unit area; while a S value is evaluated using S=(dlog IDS /dVGS)\n(1+Csg /COX), where kB denotes the Boltzmann constant, T the temperature, e the elementary electric charge and Csg the equivalent capacitance contributed by the subgap states both in bulk and interfaces\n. Vth is determined by extrapolating a straight line in a (IDS)\n1/2−VGS\nplot to the VGS axis. Constant current stress tests at a current of 5 μA, in which the drain electrode was connected to the gate electrode, were performed in air, dry O2 and vacuum (~10−1Pa) atmospheres at RT. The temperature dependences of constant current stress tests were also observed in the temperature range from 25 to 110 °C in air.\n3. Result And Discussions\n3.1. Hysteresis characteristics and stability against ambient air Fig. 1 shows typical transfer curves for the unannealed (a), dry\nannealed (b), and wet annealed (c) TFTs with the a-IGZO channels deposited at PO2 ~ 6.7 Pa. The unannealed TFTs exhibit moderately good saturation mobilities (μsat) of ~7.2 cm2(Vs)−1, but the S value is somewhat large, ~0.42V decade−1, which suggests that high-density electron traps exist in the unannealed a-IGZO channel and/or interface. Correspondingly, the unannealed TFTs have a relatively large clockwise hysteresis in the transfer characteristics ΔVG ~+0.8 V\n(measured at a sweep rate of ~3 V/s), which is explained by trap filling by accumulated electrons. Thermal annealing improved not only TFT characteristics but also the hysteresis characteristics. For example, the dry annealed TFTs improved μsat, S and ΔVG to ~9 cm2\n(Vs)−1, ~0.18V decade−1, and ~+ 0.1 V, respectively. The wet annealed TFT exhibited further improved characteristics such as μsat\n~12 cm2(Vs)−1, S ~ 0.11 V decade−1, and ΔVG ~0.0 V. These indicate that electron traps are reduced by the thermal annealing, and the wet annealing is more effective to reduce them than the dry annealing is.\nNext, we examined the influences of ambient air on the TFT\ncharacteristics such as stability of Vth. Fig. 2 shows the transfer curves of the initial states and after keeping them in air for 1month. All the TFTs exhibited negative Vth shift (ΔVth). The ΔVth values were as small as −0.06 V for the wet annealed TFT, while the unannealed and dry annealed TFTs exhibited large negative ΔVth of ~−2.4 V and −1.3 V, respectively. It is in general known that the Vth is largely affected by several causes such as the donor density in a semiconductor channel, and the existence of charged states in a channel/interface region, and negative ΔVth is explained both by the increase in donor density and the decrease in positively-charged states.\nThe transfer characteristics in the unannealed TFTs also showed large deterioration in the S value from ~0.52 to ~0.66V decade−1 after 1month (Fig. 2(a)), although μsat was nearly unchanged (~8.7 to\n~8.9 cm2(Vs)−1). In contrast, both the dry and wet annealed TFTs exhibited no degradation in the TFT characteristic parameters after 1month (from S ~ 0.23V decade− 1 and μsat ~ 8.6 cm2(Vs)− 1 to\n~0.22V decade−1 and ~8.3 cm2(Vs)−1 for the dry annealed TFTs, from ~0.12V decade−1 and ~11.7 cm2(Vs)−1 to ~0.12Vdecade−1 and\n~11.9 cm2(Vs)−1 for the wet annealed TFTs). The S value is very sensitive to subgap trap states around the Fermi level of a semiconductor channel and is deteriorated by increase in the subgap trap density . Therefore, these results suggest that donor states and extra subgap trap states are formed for the unannealed TFTs even if simply placed in air at room temperature.\nFirst-principles calculations showed that oxygen deficiency in a-IGZO plays important roles for both the electron doping and the formation of trap states, which depend on the local atomic configurations around an oxygen deficiency; i.e. an oxygen deficiency having a large free space forms both a deep occupied state and a shallow electron trap. While, if an oxygen deficiency does not have a large free space, it\ndoes not form an electron trap, and the oxygen deficiency works as a donor. . Therefore, it is suggested that the unannealed a-IGZO, which is not stabilized by thermal annealing, has weak chemical bonds, which easily generate oxygen deficiencies with different local atomic configurations even in ambient air.\n3.2. Stability under constant current stress at several atmospheres Fig. 3 shows typical time variations of ΔV th under constant current stress of 5 µ A at RT in several atmospheres. Note that the data are discontinuous at ~20 h because the measurements were terminated at ~20 h in order to measure the TFT characteristics, where some recovery of the V th occurred. All the TFTs showed positive ΔV th . The unannealed TFTs exhibit larger AV th than the wet annealed TFTs in all the atmospheres. For the current stress tests under air, the ∆ V th were\n~ 14 V for the unannealed and ~ 1.6 V for the wet annealed TFTs, respectively. It was found that all the curves were fitted well to a stretched exponential law, ΔVth = ΔVtho {1 − exp[ − ( − t/τ)\nτ denotes a time constant, β a stretched exponential exponent, and ΔV tho a saturation value [ 19 ], which indicate that ΔV th is related to dispersive carrier transport  . The obtained τ and β values were\n~3.4 × 10 4 s and 0.57 in air, 7.5 × 10 4 s and 0.59 in vacuum, and 6.5 × 10 s and 0.56 in 0 2 for the unannealed TFT, and 6.1 × 10 4 s and 0.76 in air, and 2.2 × 10 4 s and 0.72 in vacuum for the wet annealed TFT, respectively. The stretched exponential model was developed based on a dispersive carrier transport model, and β values smaller than unity indicates more dispersive carrier transport. In addition, the temperature dependence of β in air suggests that the unannealed TFT\nhas multiple trapping states, while the wet annealed TFT related to the tunneling or hopping to a defect site [ 15 ].\nThe TFT characteristic parameters during and after the stress tests are plotted in Fig. 4. All the conditions showed positive V th shifts by the current stress, which is related to deep acceptor-like traps [ 15 ]. For the unannealed TFT, large deterioration in the S value is observed, but not for the wet annealed TFT. This fact provided another important conclusion that the increase in shallow defect states in the channel has larger impact for the unannealed TFTs. It should be noted that the deterioration behaviors depended strongly on the measurement atmospheres. Particularly, the large degradation in an S\nvalue from ~0.72 to ~2.3Vdecade- 1 was observed in vacuum for the unannealed TFT. In contrast, the S value examined in dry O 2\natmosphere was not deteriorated even if the current stress was applied for 50 h. These results suggest that the large increase in trap states by the current stress in vacuum is related to oxygen deficiency.\nA similar deterioration is seen also by comparing the initial S values of the unannealed TFT in air and in vacuum: the S value was increased from ~0.68 to 0.75 V decade − 1 only when the TFT was transferred to the vacuum chamber. On the other hand, the wet annealed TFT was very stable and kept the initial S value even if the stress test was applied in vacuum. These results indicate that subgap trap states are largely generated for the unannealed TFT especially in vacuum, while the increase in the subgap states was not detected for the wet annealed TFT in any atmosphere.\nFig. 4 also shows that the deterioration of these TFT parameters is reversibly recovered to the initial values for all the atmospheres and for all the TFTs. It appears that the time variations of the recovery processes are governed by at least two processes with different time constants; i.e., the recovery process includes a fast recovery process right after the stress test was terminated, and a following slow recovery process.\n3.3. Temperature Dependences Of Δvth Under Constant Current Stress\nFig. 5 shows typical temperature dependences of ΔVth from RT to 110 °C. The Vth stability strongly depends on the stress temperature, and ΔVth was basically increased with raising the stress temperature.\nThe time variations of ΔVth for the wet annealed TFTs were fitted well to a stretched exponential law for all the stress temperatures. On the other hand, those for the unannealed and dry annealed TFTs obeyed the stretched exponential law only up to 80 and 50 °C, respectively, which will be discussed in the next paragraph. The obtained τ and β values were 5.8× 104 s and 0.57 for the unannealed TFT, 4.1× 104 s and 0.64 for the dry annealed TFT, and 1.8× 104 s and 0.71 for the wet annealed TFT, respectively. Temperature dependences of τ provide the average effective barrier height for electron transport (Eτ), which were obtained to be 0.27 eV for the unannealed TFT and 0.13 eV for the wet annealed TFT. This result suggests that the wet annealed aIGZO have a more ordered structure than the unannealed TFTs have.\nFig. 6 summarizes the TFT characteristic parameters before and after the stress tests at several temperatures. For comparison, theoretical temperature dependences of S value calculated using the Csg values obtained from the measured TFT characteristics at RT (Csg /e= 1.0 × 1012, 3.0× 1011, and 1.7 × 1011 cm−2 eV−1 for the unannealed, dry annealed, and wet annealed TFTs, respectively) are also shown. Although the temperature dependence of the S value agrees well with the calculated one for the wet annealed TFTs, those for the unannealed and dry annealed TFTs deviate largely from the theoretical S values (the dotted lines in the figure. for the S values).\nThe deviations indicate that the increases in the S values are not\nK. Nomura et al. / Thin Solid Films 518 (2010) 3012–3016 3015\nexplained only by the effect of temperature, and the increases of trap states by the heating must be considered. Thermal desorption spectra (TDS) measurements of a-IGZO films revealed that oxygenrelated species such as H2O and O2 desorbed around 100 °C for the unannealed and dry annealed films, while they are suppressed up to 300 °C for the wet annealed films . It suggests that extra oxygen deficiencies are formed and trap states are increased by the heating in the unannealed and dry annealed films. Therefore, the complicated time variation curves of ΔVth at high temperatures were observed in Fig. 5 for the unannealed and dry annealed TFTs. Moreover, large differences between the unannealed and annealed TFTs were observed after the stress tests; the deterioration induced by the current stress becomes larger with increasing temperature for the unannealed TFTs, while the annealed TFTs exhibit small or almost no deterioration against the current stress at any temperatures. It suggests that the degradation process in the unannealed TFT is controlled by a thermally activated mechanism.\n4. Conclusions\nWe have examined the hysteresis characteristics and stability\nagainst constant current stress of 5 μA in different ambient for a-IGZO\nTFTs. It was found that the wet O2 annealed TFTs have better stability than the unannealed and dry O2 annealed TFTs. The unannealed TFTs exhibited large positive ΔVth> 10 V with non-negligible deterioration in S values by current stress, while ΔVth was improved to as small as 2 V and the S value was not deteriorated for the dry and wet annealed TFTs. The deteriorations in S value by the current stress increases with increasing temperature especially in vacuum for the unannealed TFTs, suggesting that extra trap states related to oxygen deficiency were easily formed. It was also found that the Vth shift and the deterioration in S value induced by current stress are reversible phenomena and these values were recovered almost to the initial values after the stress test. For the wet annealed TFTs, the increases of the S value and trap states were suppressed well even in vacuum and at a high temperature.\n(a) unannealed, (b) dry annealed, and (c) wet annealed a-IGZO TFTs.

        "text": "Role Of Dopants As A Carrier Suppressor And Strong Oxygen Binder In Amorphous Indium-Oxide-Based Field Effect Transistor\nShanmugam Parthiban and Jang-Yeon Kwona)\nSchool of Integrated Technology, and Yonsei Institute of Convergence Technology, Yonsei University, Yeonsu-gu, Incheon 406-840, Korea (Received 17 February 2014; accepted 11 July 2014)\nIn this review, we discuss the recent developments of high-performance and improved-stability of indium-oxide-based transparent amorphous-oxide semiconductor (TAOS) thin-film transistors\n(TFTs) properties. TAOSs are widely explored with the aim of producing high-performance semiconductors suitable for the channel layer of TFTs which enable to survive under light and thermal-bias-induced stress conditions. Numerous TAOSs have been invented with some improved performance characteristics of TFTs such as mobility, light and thermal induced bias stress. However, there has been no clear elucidation of the mechanisms driving these improvements. In this review, we discuss the progression of innovations of high performance indium-oxide-based TAOS TFTs from its first reported amorphous indium gallium zinc oxide\n(a-IGZO) to present, and their properties that are correlated with the Lewis acid strength (L) and bonding strength of dopant and oxygen as a carrier suppressor and strong binder. The proposed mechanism can be practical to develop novel TAOS TFTs with high mobility and stability.\nWork on flexible thin-film transistors (TFTs) using amorphous In–Ga–Zn–O (a-IGZO)1 has revitalized interest in oxide-based electronic devices owing to their high mobility, low temperature process, good transparency to visible light, and relatively larger area coating with more uniformity.1–7 This research area has risen to a significant advance driven by researchers since a decade, resulting in publications reporting TFTs based on ZnO, SnO2, InZnO (IZO), and In2O3.\n8–25 ZnO TFTs have been studied more intensively because this structure is anticipated to exhibit better performance than a-Si: H\nand organic TFTs owing to the large Hall mobility\n(200 cm2 V1 s 1) of single-crystal ZnO26 and the prepared formation of semiconducting crystalline thin films even on unheated substrates at room temperature.\nNevertheless, the channels of ZnO TFTs are polycrystalline. Therefore, the uniformity in large areas is poor due to defects on grain boundaries, exhibiting high carrier concentrations even at room temperature due to native defects such as zinc interstitials and oxygen vacancies. Thus, it has been hard to control the threshold voltage shift and sustain against bias stress instability under various stress conditions such as thermal, light, and environmental.2,27 The most significant characteristic of the oxide semiconductor is the carrier concentration, which should be controllable over several orders of magnitude. However, oxides possess the high carrier concentration without unintentional post annealing.28 Oxide materials such as doped SnO2, In2O3, and ZnO have been used for various optoelectronic applications owing to their highly conducting and transparent properties.29–31 For optoelectronics applications, the transparent conducting oxides are required high density of mobile electrons\n(typically .1018 cm3) with high transparency.32 Nevertheless, amorphous oxide semiconductors (AOSs) channel layers are required typically carrier concentrations\n,1017 cm3 for achieving good switching operation.33 As discussed above, the pure form of oxide semiconductors is polycrystalline and possesses the high carrier concentrations.34 On the other hand, the same binary oxide compounds, mixing an appropriate amount form amorphous phases such as Zn–In–O (a-ZIO) and Zn–Sn–O (a-ZTO).3,11 In general, the mixing of two or more cations with different ionic charges and sizes is effective to enhance the formation of an amorphous phase, suppressing crystallization and carrier concentration.3 Based on this AOSs are mixing multicomponent systems. Moreover, several AOSs have been invented such as a-In–Zn–O\n(a-IZO),3 (a-IGZO),1 a-Hf–In–Zn–O (a-HIZO),35,36 a-ZTO,11 a-Ga–Zn–Sn–O (a-GZTO),37 a-Al–Sn–In–Zn–O (a-ATIZO),38,39 a-Al–Zn–Sn–O (a-AZTO),40 etc.\nThe a-ZTO has identified as an excellent AOS for earth abandoned and low-cost applications. However, the TFT\nfabrication required a high temperature annealing at\n.200 °C which is not suitable for flexible substrates.41 a)Address all correspondence to this author.\nEven though ternary or multi-metal oxide TFTs have high mobility, they often suffer from severe bias, light and environmental instabilities, limiting their potential applications.27 For instability, three degradation models have been proposed which can be considered as plausible mechanisms such as trapping of photogenerated hole carriers, the creation of ionized oxygen defects, and the photodesorption of oxygen related molecules.45–49 The trapping of photogenerated hole carriers can be controlled by suitable dielectric and passivation layer. However, the creation of ionized oxygen defects and photodesorption of oxygen, to find out the solution for this, a high bonding strength between dopants and oxygen could be controlled to diffuse out oxygen and creation of oxygen defects.27 The defects center can be an oxygen vacancy defect, metal interstitial, or hydrogen-related complex. Among the ranges of defects, the negative bias illumination stress instability is often attributed to oxygen vacancy defects.50,51 The possibility of an oxygen vacancy defect is when a neutral oxygen vacancy defect accepts a hole carrier to form a positive oxygen vacancy defect where an oxygen vacancy acts as a donor-like trap.27 The origin of vacancy defects creation in the active channel layer has been described in more detail in the review papers.27 The beginner can understand bias stress instability and oxygen vacancy creation which have been explained in more detail in a review paper.27,52,53 Moreover, the mechanisms of oxygen vacancy defect creation have been explained in more depth in the review paper with suitable explanations.27,52,53 Nomura et al. first introduced gallium (Ga) into a-IZO,\nwhich has subsequently been shown to endorse amorphicity, controlling carrier concentration and oxygen vacancy via strong bonding strength because the bonding strength of Ga–O is stronger than In–O and Zn–O.1 Subsequently, Hf and Zr are introduced instead of Ga into a-IZO TFTs, which have shown high stability under bias stress and environmental conditions35,54 though the reported mobility is lower than that of the high performance a-IGZO TFTs.\nThis work claimed the reason for improved stability that the bonding strength of Hf–O and Zr–O is stronger than that of In–O, Ga–O, and Zn–O which suppress the carrier concentrations creation via oxygen vacancy and enhance the stability of TFTs.35,54 After, numerous other carrier suppressors or \"oxygen getters\" 55 have been investigated such as Ti,56,57 W,57–59 Gd,60 Ba,61–63 Sr,63,64 Si,57,65,66 Sc,67 Y,68–70 La,71 Ta,72,73 Mg,74 Ce,75 Sn.76 To explain the role of a carrier suppressor, some studies have postulated that ionic size and metal–oxygen bonding strength are the key factors to control carrier concentrations.55 But some studies have argued that lower electronegativity is desired,67,71 while some studies argued that higher values better control oxygen vacancies.54 To improve the stability of oxide TFTs, strong oxygen binders have been identified as a key factor that lead to improved bias stress instability of TFTs.41,54,57 However, a clear method for choosing appropriate carrier suppressor dopants associated with their ionic size, electronegativity, and metal–oxygen bonding strength to enhance the mobility and stability of TFTs is yet to be reported. In this work, we discuss the role of dopants associated with high Lewis acid strength (L) and bonding strength of dopant and oxygen as carrier suppressors and strong binder in amorphous indium-oxide-based TFTs, presents a method for choosing effective carrier suppressor dopants to enhance the performance and stability of TFTs.\nIi. Role Of Carrier Suppressor And\nStrong Binder Dopants In Amorphous\nIn this section, we discuss the role of the carrier suppressor and strong binder in AOS TFTs. To understand the role of the carrier suppressor, it is useful to compare systems undoped and doped carrier suppressor AOSs such as a-IZO and a-IGZO. As can be seen in Fig. 1(a),2,4 a-IZO has higher electron mobility than a-IGZO, but is significantly more difficult to control at the low electron concentrations which are required for TFTs (far below 1017 cm3). The first-principles density-functional theory implies that In–O acts as a mobility enhancer in the a-IGZO system, Zn–O acts as a network former, and Ga–O acts as a carrier suppressor.5 Ga–O bonding strength is much stronger than In–O and Zn–O bonding strength, meaning that the incorporation of Ga suppresses the formation of oxygen deficiencies and the consequent generation of mobile electrons. On the other hand, the incorporation of high Ga content deteriorates the electron mobility [Fig. 1(b)]. Therefore, the addition of an appropriate amount of suppressor ions that form substitution doping and strong chemical bonds with oxygen ions is important for stable AOS materials and TFTs. The strong bonding strength between suppressor dopant and oxygen resulted that it diminishes an oxygen vacancy (VO) that suppress the carrier concentrations because one oxygen vacancy contributes two electrons in the conduction band. Incorporation of high Lewis acid strength and strong oxygen binder dopants could suppress the formation of shallow oxygen vacancy defects as well as deep oxygen vacancy defects in the active channel layers. Therefore, the addition of oxygen binders into the metal oxide channel layer should be chosen vital quantity to secure realistic transport properties, as well as the good photostability.41\nThe strong bonding strength between suppressor and oxygen enhances the stability of TFTs. From these arguments, we could understand that the carrier suppressor dopants and oxygen bonding are significantly important to enhance the performance and stability of TFTs.\nMost of the carrier suppressors have been chosen based on the electronegativity of metal dopants in the amorphous oxide matrix rather considering effective charge, ionic size, and metal–oxygen bonding strength.58,62,65 Since Ga doped into a-IZO, subsequently, numerous other carrier suppressors have been investigated based on the electronegativity of metal ions. To explain the role of a carrier suppressor in a-IZO properties enhancement, some studies have postulated that metal ion electronegativity is the key factor of oxygen suppressor.54,56 In addition, ionic radius size is also important to choose an efficacy carrier suppressor.55 The Ga has an ionic radius significantly smaller than that of In and similar to that of Zn, so that Ga placed as substitution sites act as a carrier suppressor in an amorphous oxide. Conversely, lanthanum (La) has larger ionic radii than those of In and Zn which may not be placed as substitution sites that lead to cause local structure disruption, hindering charge transport, degraded mobility, and stability of TFTs.71 The zirconium (Zr),54 hafnium (Hf),35 silicon (Si),57,65,66 titanium (Ti),57 tungsten (W),57–59 and tantalum (Ta)72,73 doped indium-oxide-based TFTs have shown that the high bonding strength of dopants is one of the key factors to determine the stability. The W-, Si-, and Ti-doped indium oxide suggested higher bonding strength of dopants and oxygen is an efficacy to improve the performance and stability of TFTs.57 However, La-doped a-IZO had reported lower mobility than that of high performance a-IGZO even though the bonding strength of La–O (;799.0) is higher than that of Ga–O.77 The reason for this low performance could be due to the ionic size of La which is larger than that of In and Zn.71 Based on the above-mentioned postulates we propose that the smaller ionic size, high effective charge, high electronegativity, and strong metal-oxide bonding strength of dopants are the important key factors to determine the mobility and stability of TFTs.\nIii. Recent Progress Of Carrier\nSuppressor And Strong Binder Doped\nIndium-Oxide-Based Tfts\nIn this section, we have discussed the recent progress of carrier suppressor and strong binder doped amorphous indium-oxide-based TFTs from first reported a-IGZO\nTFTs to up to now and examined their properties, tabulated in Table I. In recent years, number of dopants incorporated instead of Ga into amorphous indium-oxide-based TFTs to find out an effective carrier suppressor and bonding strength enhancer. The obtained significant novel amorphous indium-oxide-based TFTs and their properties, merits, and demerits are briefly discussed to find out an effective carrier suppressor and strong binder.\nIZO is an excellent AOS. However, the carrier concentration is quite high, and this has impeded TFT device performance such as mobility and stability under thermal and light. To overcome this problem, in 2004, Ga introduced as a carrier suppressor in the IZO matrix and distantly reduced the carrier concentrations as shown in Fig. 2.1,4 The carrier concentration in the a-IGZO is significantly reduced to below 1013 cm3 by reducing partial pressure oxygen from 0 to 8 Pa, whereas it remains at 1018 cm3 in the a-InZnO deposited under the same conditions.1,4 The Ga is believed to attract oxygen\n| TABLE I.

owing to its high ionic potential (13 valence and small ionic radius), and thereby suppresses electron injection which is caused by oxygen ions escaping from the thin film since the vacancy of one oxygen contributes two electrons in the conduction band.\nThe field effect mobility evaluated from the saturation region was ;12 cm2 V1 s 1, which is larger than that of a-Si: H TFT; however, the stability of a-IGZO TFTs still remains the most critical issue for bias thermal and light induced studies.27\nIn 2009, Chang et al. introduced Hf as a carrier suppressor in the a-IZO matrix and improved the bias stress stability of the TFT, while the mobility comparable to a-IGZO TFTs.36 TFTs with a-HIZO active channels exhibit good electrical properties with field effect mobility of around 10 cm2 V1 s 1, subthreshold swing (ss) of 0.23 V/decade, and high Ion/Ioff ratio of over 108.\nFigure 3 shows that, under a bias-temperature stress test, the HIZO TFTs with 0.3 mol% Hf content showed only a 0.46 V shift in threshold voltage, compared with a 3.25 V shift in HIZO TFT for 0.1 mol%. The Hf ions played a key role in improving the instability of TFTs due to high oxygen bonding ability.\nIn 2009, J. S. Park et al. reported a novel InZrZnO\nTFT where the Zr had incorporated as a carrier and oxygen vacancy formation suppressor.54 They postulated that Zr cations act as carrier suppressors. The electron carrier concentrations in the ZrInZnO films were found to decrease from 4  1016 cm3 to 1  1014 cm3 with increasing Zr concentrations. Figure 4(a) shows the transfer characteristics of the Zr0.4 In1.2Zn0.4O3 TFTs annealed at 350 °C for 2 h. The ZrInZnO TFTs exhibited a field-effect mobility of 3.9 cm2 V1 s 1, a ss value of 0.98 V/decade, a Vth of 1.6 V, and an Ion/Ioff ratio of approximately 107. In addition, InZrZnO TFTs had been investigated and compared with IGZO TFTs under the bias stress of a drain-current stress of 3 mA at VDS 5 10 V\nwhich was applied to the sample for a period of 60 h.\nThe variation of Vth for the ZrInZnO TFT device during the application of the on-state current stress is shown in Fig. 4(b). The stabilities of the a-IGZO TFT sample annealed at 350 °C and the ZrInZnO TFT samples annealed at 250 and 350 °C have been compared. The ZrInZnO\ndevice annealed at 250 °C showed a large positive shift\n(;24 V) in Vth after the application of the bias stress for 60 h. However, the ZrInZnO device annealed at 350 °C\nexhibited a dramatic improvement; specifically a 0.99 V\nshift in Vth after the 60 h bias stress. Compared with InGaZnO TFTs, the better stability of the ZrInZnO TFT\ndevices can be attributed to more suppression of the carrier concentration and stronger binding energy of the Zr in the ZrInZnO channel layer. These overall transfer characteristics are shown in Fig. 4(b). It has been shown that these ZrInZnO TFTs have excellent stabilities under long-term bias stresses.\nIn 2009, Cho et al. invented a novel quaternary a-Al–Sn–In–Zn–O (ATIZO) channel layer and the transfer characteristics of ATIZO TFTs before and post-annealed conditions are shown in Fig. 5.38 The a-ATIZO used as a channel layer and high-K-Al2Ox used as the gate insulator for fabrication of TFT at 250 °C.38 The ATIZO TFT exhibited a field effect mobility of 30.2 cm2 V1 s 1, a ss of 0.17 V/dec, and an on/off current ratio of 109.\nIn 2009, Kumomi et al. explored indium-based ternary AOS, i.e., In–X–O with Mg, Al, Si, Ti, Zn, Ga, Ge, Mo, and Sn channel layer materials.14 The dopants which were chosen based on their ionic radii and electron affinities. Figure 6 shows the transfer curve of doped indium-oxide-based AOS TFTs. In this work, Si-, Ge-, and B-doped In–O\nTFTs achieved higher performance than other dopants.\nThe Mo-, Ti-, and Sn-doped In–O TFTs are shown more conductive. The reason for conductive transfer characteristics of Mo-, Ti-, and Sn-doped indium oxide TFTs could be the excess Mo, Ti, and Sn doping amount and oxygen partial pressure.\nIn 2010, Chong et al. reported a-Si–In–Zn–O TFT\nwith a high field effect mobility of 21.6 cm2 V1 s 1 and an Ion/Ioff of 106 at a process temperature of 150 °C which is suitable for flexible display applications.65 The stability of a-SIZO TFT was compared with a-IZO and a-IGZO\nTFTs as shown in Fig. 7(a).65 The a-SIZO TFT showed a 3.7 V shift for threshold voltage (Vth) compared with 10.8 V shift in IZO TFT after bias temperature stress.\nThe performance of the a-SIZO TFT was compared with those of a-IZO and a-GIZO TFTs after a bias-thermal stress (BTS); drain current (ID) of 3 lA at drain-voltage of 10 V for 420 min to find the effect of Si on the stability of a-SIZO TFT as shown in Fig. 7(b). As the stress time increased, Vth shifted positively for all TFTs.\nA large positive shift of V th , 10.8 V, was observed for IZO TFT after BTS. However, a positive shift of V th by only 3.7 V was realized for a-SIZO TFT even with only 1 wt% Si in the IZO system. This result indicates that the\na-SIZO TFT is more stable than the a-IZO and a-GIZO\nTFTs. In the case of low processing temperature, including annealing treatment below 150 °C, all these characteristics showed enhanced mobility and bias thermal stability compared with those of others. The electrical properties of the SIZO TFTs confirmed that µ FE decreased with increasing Si concentration, indicating that Si was acting as a carrier suppressor due to reducing Vo in the SIZO system, due to higher bonding-strengths of silicon (775 kJ/mol) than those of zinc (385 kJ/mol) and indium (470 kJ/mol). 6\nIn 2013, Lan et al. developed a novel Ta-doped In–Zn–O (a-TIZO) TFTs which exhibit a field effect mobility of 11 cm 2 V − 1 s − 1 with I on /I off of 10 9 . 73 This study confirmed that Ta suppresses oxygen from outdiffusing during annealing, resulting in improving the bias stability under positive bias stress and light induced conditions. Furthermore, this work suggested that owing to its wider band gap and lower absorption of Ta 2 O 5 the a-TIZO-TFT exhibited better stability under light illumination than a-IZO-TFT.\nIn 2013, Aikawa et al. invented a novel tungsten-,\ntitanium-, and silicon-doped amorphous indium oxide (WIO, TiIO, SiIO) TFTs at a process temperature of 50 The WIO, TiIO, and SiIO TFTs have 150 °C 57 reported a saturation field effect mobility of ∼ 30, 32, and 17 cm 2 V 2 1 s 2 1 with an I on/I off ratio of 10 9 . 57 This work proposed a new mechanism that the presence of a tiny amount of dopants prevents crystallization and leads to the formation of a very flat and smooth surface that reduces the degradation of carrier mobility.\nAnother important key point reported that the higher bonding-dissociation energy, which means higher bonding strength between dopants and oxygen, became less sensitive when thermal annealing. If the energy of the\nresulted it is difficult to create oxygen vacancy. Based on the bonding strength concepts, they suggested that high bonding strength of Si–O-doped metal oxide be efficacy to improve the stability and mobility of TFTs.\nHowever, the proposed mechanism is in contrast with La-doped IZO TFTs because La–O (799.0) has high bonding strength which is similar to Si–O (799.6) bonding strength. The La-doped IZO TFTs reported lower mobility than the a-IZO and a-IGZO TFTs.71,77\nI. Ga-, Yr-, Sc-, Ga-Doped Izo\nIn 2013, Hennek et al.55 studied chemical similarities and differences in ionic radius cations such as Ga31, Sc31, Y31, and La31 doped a-IZO TFTs. These ions doped with a-IZO channel layer and processed under identical conditions to understand how their dopant affects in a-IZO TFTs. These works concluded that the metal oxide lattice formation enthalpy and metal ionic radius are the best predictors of doped IZO oxygen getter efficacy.\nThis work studied positive bias stress stability of Ga31, La31, Y31, Sc31 doped a-IZO TFTs. The bias stress stability has not improved even though the bonding strength of La–O, Y–O, and Sc–O is higher than Ga–O because of larger ionic size than Ga31 that degraded the transport properties. This study indicates that ionic size and metal–oxygen bonding strength are the most important key parameters to improve the mobility and stability of metal oxide TFTs.\nIn 2013, Banger et al. reported high performance of Sr- and Ba-doped a-IZO TFTs after hydrolysis and post-annealed.63 The Sr- and Ba-doped semiconductors exhibit enhanced electrical stability and reduced threshold voltage shift compared with IGZO. The enhanced stability can be explained based on the higher Gibbs energy of oxidation of Ba and Sr compared with Ga. Ba and Sr metals were chosen as appropriate candidates to dope IZO based on the calculation of the Gibbs energy of oxidation and their larger cation radii. The Sr, and Ba replacement of Ga for the tighter oxygen binding alkaline earth metals is supposed to suppress, the formation of excess charge carriers in the oxide film, which may hinder charge transport and hence reduce device mobility.\nHowever, the larger cation radii dopants Ba and Sr contradict with La- and Y-doped IZO TFTs which suggested that larger ionic radii are not suitable for improved performance of TFTs.55 The insertion of large atomic radius dopants makes it difficult for the Zn and In to be in their correct positions. Therefore, the large atomic radius of dopants could cause the creation of trap states.71 Lattice distortion due to the large atomic radius of dopants results in the creation of defects, which could be one of the reasons for the reduction in l. The strong bonding strength of Sr–O and Ba–O could be one of the reasons for enhanced stability of Ba- and Sr-doped a-IZO TFTs.77 Since the bonding strength of Sr–O and Ba–O is greater than Ga–O\nwhich is one of the key factors to improve the stability via tightening oxygen bonding to suppress the formation of excess carrier concentrations in the active channel layer.\nIv. How To Choose The Appropriate\nCarrier Suppressor Dopants To\nControl Carrier Concentrations In\nAmorphous Oxide Tfts\nMost of the amorphous oxide TFTs have been developed based on the electronegativity and standard electrode potential of dopants.58,62,65 Three decades ago, Wen et al.,80 recently Kim research group81–92 and Parthiban et al.34,93,94 have developed high-mobility Zr-,\nGermanium (Ge-), Sn-, W-, Nb-, Mo-, Si-, and Ti-doped indium oxide transparent conducting thin-films, which were followed by the development of empirical relations and postulates by Zhang.95 The empirical relationship associated with electron negativity, ionic radii, and effective charge of dopants, was proposed by Zhang and defined the function as a scale for strength of Lewis acids.\nLewis acid or base is defined as a pair of electron acceptor or donator, respectively. Strength defines how easily it is done by particular acid/base. A stronger Lewis acid will easily accept more electrons than a weaker one.\nLewis acid–base interactions play an important role in understanding chemical bonds, relations, and equilibria. A scale for the Lewis acid strengths has been calculated from the dual parameter equation, one parameter is Z/r 2, where Z is the charge number of the atomic core and r is the ionic radius related to the electrostatic force, and another parameter is the electronegativity (vZ) of elements in valence states. The quantity of Z/r 2 was calculated with the use of ionic radii mainly from Shannon96 and Dean.97 The equation for classification is derived from plotting Z/r 2 against vZ.\n$$L=Z/r^{2}-7.7\\chi_{Z}+8.0\\quad,$$\nwhere L is Lewis acid strength of element.\nWhen choosing appropriate dopants, the following must be taken into account.\n(1) The ideal doping cations should have smaller ionic radius (rk) which is associated with a higher effective nuclear charge (Z).\n(2) According to the study of Wen et al., the high Lewis acid dopants polarize the electronic charge away from the oxygen 2p valence band more strongly than the weaker Lewis acids, this results in screening of the charge and weakens its activity as a scattering center hence increasing the mobility. The scattering center is one of the significant parameters deciding mobility if the scattering center is low that may expect high mobility. The high Lewis acid strength of elements suppresses scattering by oxygen interstitials that resulted in high mobility.\n(3) The size of the ionic dopant should be smaller than that of the host materials; otherwise, the dopants will act as a defect which causes deterioration in the electrical properties.79\n(4) Choosing an appropriate amount of carrier suppressor dopants is more important to control carrier scattering; otherwise, excess dopants which act as ionized scattering centers lead to deteriorating mobility.\n(5) The metal-oxide bonding strength of carrier suppressor dopant and oxide should be higher than the host metal oxide to control the carrier generation via formation of oxygen vacancy to enhance the stability of TFTs.\nBased on the L, vz, and Z/r 2 and bonding strength of dopant and oxygen of the elements are tabulated in Table II.

As shown in Table II, the electronegativity of Ti41, Zr41, Ga31, Hf 41, Al31 is ;1.5, Sb and Si is ;1.7, B31, Mo61, and W61 is ;2.0, C and Mn71 is\n;2.5. Even though the electronegativity is almost comparable, however, their L value is differing more because of Z/r 2. From Table II, it can be observed that the electronegativity of the dopant element is not only considered when designing novel metal oxide TFTs via suppression of the carrier concentrations. Another important parameter is bonding strength of metal and oxygen\n(M–O). If bonding strength is high it is expected to be more stable; therefore, it is necessary to compare bonding strength with their L of elements. The value of L and their M–O are tabulated in Table II. The bonding strength of metal and oxygen (M–O) such as La–O (799.0), Si–O (799.6), Ta–O (799.1), Zr–O\n(776.0), and Hf–O (801.7)77 are almost the same.\nHowever, except La–O, others have been identified as efficacy dopants to suppress carrier concentration and improve stability, because the La has larger ionic size, smaller electronegativity, lower Z/r 2, and Lewis acid strength than indium and zinc that leads to low performance than other dopants. From these, we conclude that the strength of metal and oxygen is not only considered for when selecting appropriate dopants but also when selecting appropriate dopants for L relation to ionic radii and the effective charge of elements and metal-oxide bonding strength.\nSince the first demonstration of TFTs using a-IGZO\nas a channel layer, there has been a rapid growth in oxide channel layer materials in recent years toward commercialization. Although the device performance of a-IGZO TFTs has been substantially improved, the device reliability in the presence of external light and gate bias stress remains a critical issue. At present, Samsung Electronics, Toppan, Sharp, and LG Display have demonstrated prototypes of active matrix liquid crystal display and active matrix organic light emitting diode panels that integrate a-IGZO TFT backplanes. In recent years, to overcome stability issues, Si, Hf, Zr, Ta, etc. have been incorporated instead of Ga as carrier suppressors into the IZO system which has successfully improved reliability.\nFrom this review, we suggested that the L, Z/r 2, and M–O are the important key parameters to improve the stability and high performance of TFTs. Based on L, Z/r 2, and M–O, it is suggested that Ti41, W61, Ge41, Ta51, Nb51, Si41, B31, and C41 doped AOSs would be suitable for high performance and stability of TFTs. It is observed that the high L and bonding strength of the dopant act as a carrier suppressor for oxygen in the amorphous oxide system, and could, therefore, be effective for high performance TFT fabrication. Specifically, high L with J. Mater. Res., Vol. 29, No. 15, Aug 14, 2014 1593\nhigh Z/r 2 and bonding strength of carrier suppressor and bonding strength enhancer dopants such as Ti41, W61, Ge41, Si41, B31, and C41, doping an appropriate amount in the amorphous oxide is predicted to be an effective carrier suppressor and strong binder in IZO to enhance the performance and stability and alternative to most studied a-IGZO TFTs. Adding high L with Z/r 2 and bonding strength of dopants as carrier suppressors in metal oxide TFTs but also suppress the carrier concentrations and enhance strong metal-oxide bonding strength, it also enhances the amorphous nature and lowers the temperature for processing. Additionally, high Lewis acid strength dopants results in screening of the charge and weakens its activity as a scattering center, therefore, increasing the mobility. In the case if the scattering center is low that may expect high mobility. The incorporation of a high L with high Z/r 2 and bonding strength dopant as a carrier suppressor into AOS-based TFTs is a useful route to produce improved stability and higher performance TFTs, which may enable the realization of next-generation flat panel displays. The proposed mechanism could be useful in the development of high stability and high performance next generation novel AOS TFTs.\n(Ministry of Science, ICT, and Future Planning),\nKorea, under the \"IT Consilience Creative Program\"\n(NIPA-2014-H0201-14-1001) supervised by the NIPA\n(National IT Industry Promotion Agency).\n1.

Park1 & Yong-Sung Kim4,5 1Research Center for Dielectric and Advanced Matter Physics, Pusan National University, Pusan 609-735, Korea, 2Center for Correlated Electron Systems, Institute for Basic Science (IBS), Seoul 151-747, Korea, 3Department of Physics and Astronomy, Seoul National University, Seoul 151-747, Korea, 4Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science, Yuseong, Daejeon 305-340, Korea, 5Department of Nano Science, University of Science and Technology, Daejeon 305-350, Korea.\nSubstitutional hydrogen at oxygen site (HO) is well-known to be a robust source of n-type conductivity in ZnO, but a puzzling aspect is that the doping limit by hydrogen is only about 1018 cm23, even if solubility limit is much higher. Another puzzling aspect of ZnO is persistent photoconductivity, which prevents the wide applications of the ZnO-based thin film transistor. Up to now, there is no satisfactory theory about two puzzles. We report the bistability of HO in ZnO through first-principles electronic structure calculations.\nWe find that as Fermi level is close to conduction bands, the HO can undergo a large lattice relaxation, through which a deep level can be induced, capturing electrons and the deep state can be transformed into shallow donor state by a photon absorption. We suggest that the bistability can give explanations to two puzzling aspects.\nSince ZnO-based oxide semiconductors are promising materials for transparent oxide electronics and blue LED, the oxides have been extensively investigated1,2. Hydrogen is an ubiquitous element, and in semiconductors, hydrogen-related problems have always been important subjects, since hydrogen shows complicated properties and plays a role as either carrier-generating or trapping center. Generally, oxide materials are easily contaminated by hydrogen impurities due to the strong bonding of the H atoms to an O atom, and hydrogen contamination is believed to be an important source of the natural n-type conductivity of ZnO3,4.\nHydrogen impurities are suggested to have two kinds of donor-like states in ZnO: (i) interstitial hydrogen (Hi) at a bond-center (HBC1) or at an antibonding (HAB1) site4–7 and (ii) substitutional H at an O site (HO)\n8. The interstitial H can be easily removed through thermal annealing due to its high mobility5, and thus, HO is suggested to be robust source for n-type conductivity8. However, there is a long-term unresolved puzzle. The maximum available free carrier concentration (ne,max) in H-rich ZnO is limited to only about ,1018 cm23 9–11, even if the H concentration in ZnO can be as high as ,1020 cm23 12 and the O-deficiency is simultaneously serious13. Since a heavier ntype doping can be achieved (,1020 cm23) in Al-doped ZnO14, the formation of acceptor-like native defects such as Zn-vacancy is not considered to be the main reason for compensation15,16.\nThere is another puzzling aspect in ZnO, which is persistent photo-conductivity (PPC) in ZnO17. Since the PPC\nis a source of the light-induced instability of ZnO-based active device in flat panel display18, many researches are now invested to prevent it. Generally, the PPC is suggested to be explained by the presence of bi-stable centers such as DX center in AlGaAs:Si19. Lany and Zunger have suggested an interesting mechanism by considering that VO level in ZnO is sensitively lowered by electron occupancy due to the strong electron-lattice coupling20.\nNormally, the VO is a deep donor, but the fully-ionized VO\n21 state can be a metastable shallow donor state, since the defect level of VO\n21 is located above the conduction band minimum (CBM), and thus an electron at CBM may not be easily excited into the defect level. However, the metastability of VO\n21 1 2e has not yet been proven explicitly. Later, the more direct calculations showed that bi-stability of VO does not exist for all (0), (1), and\n(21)-charge states, although the breathing type of atomic relaxation depending on charge state is quite large, which is not enough to explain the room-T PPC21. Therefore, up to now, there is no satisfactory theory to explain the puzzles in ZnO.\nIn this paper, we report the bistability of shallow donor HO in ZnO, which has never been discussed yet. We find that the bistability of O-vacancy can be realized, when it is coupled by a hydrogen. We show that as Fermi level is close to the conduction band, the HO can undergo a large lattice relaxation (LLR), capturing electrons at a deep level which is created by the LLR. It is shown that the bistability can give clear explanations to the microscopic mechanisms of long-term puzzling phenomena in ZnO: the persistent photo-conductivity in ZnO and the low doping limit of H-rich ZnO.\nIn ZnO, a H atom is suggested to be strongly captured by an Ovacancy, which is a substitutional impurity at O-site (HO), as shown in Fig. 1(a). The HO state is known to be a robust state, and normally positively charged, as suggested by Janotti et al.8, since the highest occupied state from the hydrogen state is located above the CBM.\nHowever, here we find that HO can be negatively charged and capture electrons through a large lattice relaxation (LLR). We find that in the negative charge state, the H atom can be significantly displaced into an interstitial hollow (H)-site22,23. The LLR structure is described by Fig. 1(b).\nThrough the LLR, the H is separated from O-vacancy site, and thus the LLR structure can be considered as a pair of Hi 2 and VO\n0, that is a Frenkel defect. In this respect, it is similar to the well-known DX\ncenter in AlGaAs19. Thus, we call the LLR structure as ''H-DX''. The present H-DX is slightly different from DX center. In the former, two H-O bonds are broken by LLR [see Fig. 1(b)], while in the latter, only one bond is broken. In the H-DX, as shown in Fig. 1(b), the H couples with three Zn atoms which are located altogether at a same layer of ab-plane. Electronic structure calculations indicate that a deep level within gap is created by the LLR and it captures two electrons, as shown in Fig. 2(a). The more detail will be discussed below. We examined another metastable LLR structure, which is described as H-DX* in Fig. 1(c), where the displaced H is located between two ablayers. This state is less stable by 0.26 eV than H-DX, and the H-DX*\nis less probable to be formed, compared to the H-DX. We also examined another LLR: only one Zn atom is separated from the H, similarly to conventional DX center, but we find that these states are unstable, the deep level is not formed by the LLR.\nAs shown by Figs. 2(a) and 2(b), electronic structure calculations indicate that two deep levels are created by H-DX2. The lower a level is located at 0.49 eV above the VBM, and the upper a* level is located at 1.06 eV below the CBM. As shown by Fig. 2(d), the a level is found to come mainly from the H atom and the nearby H-coupled Zn atoms ((Zn(1), Zn(4), Zn(5) in Fig. 1(b)), and, as shown by Fig. 2(e), the upper a* level comes mainly from the O-vacancy site, i.e., from the Zn(2) and Zn(3) atoms separated from H. The two defect levels are fully occupied. The electronic energy reduction by the capture of two electrons at a* level contributes to the stabilization of the H-DX.\nIn the isolated point defect VO, four nearby Zn atoms are relaxed inward by the electron capture of VO. In the VO\n0, the Zn atoms are relaxed inward by about 0.24 A˚ from ideal positions (ideal Zn-O\nbond lengths: dZn-O 5 1.97 and 1.99 A˚)\n21. Similarly, in the H-DX2, Zn(2) and Zn(3) atoms are inward relaxed by 0.28 A˚ and 0.32 A˚,\nrespectively. Three Zn host cations coupled to the H move towards the H by about 0.12 A˚ (0.10 A˚ for Zn(5)), from ideal locations. For the H-DX2 LLR structure, the H atom is largely displaced by 1.92 A˚ from the original location of HO.\nIn the neutral state, the H-DX structure becomes unstable, since the electronic energy reduction by one electron trap is not enough to stabilize it. Similarly, in the positive charge state, the H-DX structure is unstable. The H-DX2 structure is stable only in the negative charge state, having two electrons at a* level, and it is more stable than the HO in the negative charge state, which is actually HO\n1 1 2e(at CBM),\nsince the donor level of HO is located much higher than CBM.\nNow, we examine the stability of H-DX state relative to the normal HO\n1, depending on Fermi level (eF), by calculating the formation enthalpies. Since two structures have different charge states, the relative stability should depend on Fermi level. The calculated results of eF-dependent formation enthalpies of these states are shown in Fig. 3.\nHere, we assumed O-poor and H-rich conditions (simulating the Odeficient and H-rich case). Since HO is shallow-donor-like, only the positive charge state is stable when Fermi level is inside the band gap.\nThe calculational results indicate that as Fermi level is located above 0.05 eV below the CBM, electron-capturing H-DX2 becomes more stable than HO\n1. We did not consider the interstitial H (Hi) state, assuming that substitutional HO is much more dominant than interstitial hydrogenic Hi state, since the Hi is suggested to be easily removed through thermal annealing due to its high mobility.\nThese results indicate that when Fermi level is close to the 0.05 eV\nbelow CBM, the concentration of the H-DX states becomes comparable to that of HO. These indicate that the pinning position of the Fermi level is located at about 0.05 eV below CBM.\nThe results indicate that HO state can be self-compensated through LLR transition. An electron can be generated by a shallow donor such as HO, and the electron is captured by other HO:\n0?HO\nH O + E → H - Dx − .\nThe overall process is found to be exothermic by 0.10 eV, when Fermi level is located at CBM.\nWe estimated total energy profile for the structural transformation between H O and H-DX . The H-DX structure in the neutral or (+)-\ncharge state is unstable. When the high concentration of electron carriers is present at conduction band, two electrons can be captured by the H O through the deformation toward H-DX structure, and the H-DX  state can be more stable than the H O + 2 e (at CB). We calculated the variation of the total energy according to the structural deformation, as shown in Fig. 4, and we find that there is the energy barrier for the structural recovery: H O þ  + 2 e → H - DX − . It is estimated to be 0.36 eV.\nWe calculated the imaginary dielectric function [ ɛ 2 ( ω )] 24 of the H -\nDX − , as shown in Fig. 2(f), which describes the optical absorption spectrum. The peak in the phonon energy spectrum was estimated to be about 2.3 eV. The minimum optical excitation energy (E opt ) from α * level to CBM in the H-DX − was estimated to be about 1.06 eV.\nWe examined the binding energies of H O + and H - DX − with respect to well-separated H t and V O . The binding energies of H O T and H-DX - were estimated by comparing two states, i.e., by using [E(H i + E(V o 0 )] − [E(H o 2 ) + E(pure)] and using [E(H i + E(Voo) + 2e (at CBM)] − [E(H-DX~) + E(pure)], respectively. As shown by (gray)-dashed lines in Fig. 3, the binding energy of H O + is estimated to be 0.97 eV, which is largely exothermic, which is comparable to the previous large values of 0.80 eV (in LDA) and 3.8 eV (in LDA + U) in other calculations. The binding energy of H-DX¯ is also estimated to be largely exothermic by 1.27 eV. Thus, this indicates that substitutional H-DX  is a thermally-stable complex defect.\nThe electronic structure of H - DX , as schematically described by Fig. 2(c), can be understood with respect to interaction between H i and V O . As Takenaka and Singh suggested, H itself in H O + is anionlike, capturing two electrons 25 , indicating that H O + is rather a complex defect composed of the H i − and V O 2 + . The anionic behavior is not a surprising one, since H electronegativity (ζ) is between those of Zn and O [ζ(H) = 2.2, ζ(Zn) = 1.65, and ζ(O) = 3.44]. The V O 2+ in 3 Figure 3 | Calculated formation enthalpies of HO\n1 (blue lines) and HDX2 (red lines) in ZnO as a function of Fermi level, assuming H-rich and O-poor condition. We also show those of the separated Hi 1 and VO defects\n1 R Hi 11VO\n0 and HO\n1 R Hi 1 1 VO\n0 1 2e by (gray)-dashed lines).\nThe vertical solid lines indicate the VBM and the CBM, and the vertical\n(green) solid-line indicates the pinning position of Fermi-level (epin). The calculational details are written in supplementary information.\ncomplex defect HO cannot trap the electron25, since the Zn-s-levels around the H atom are pushed upward above the CBM by the strong interaction between the upper Zn-s-level and the lower H-s-level8.\nTherefore, the electronic property of the H atom is anionic either at HO\n25 or at H-DX state22,23 and the level of H-s orbital is located lower than that of Zn-s-orbital.\nIn the HO, a H atom interacts strongly with four Zn atoms, while a Zn atom with one H atom, and thus, the H-level is largely pushed down to below the valence band maximum (VBM) and all of Zn-slevels are located above the CBM, as described in Fig. 2(c). On the other hand, in the H-DX, the H atom at H-site interacts with just three Zn atoms, so the hydrogenic level is less pushed-down and becomes located above VBM (a level in Fig. 2b). Through the LLR\nfrom HO to H-DX, the interaction between the H and theVO becomes weaker and the VO level becomes deeper below the CBM [see Fig. 2(a)]. Two Zn atoms (Zn(2) and Zn(3) in Fig. 1(b)) are separated from H by the LLR, and the generated Zn dangling bonds can induce a deep level (a* level), which becomes deeper through the interaction between two Zn-dangling bonds, described by red lines in Fig. 2(c).\nWe, thus, suggest that the electronic energy reduction by the capture of electrons at the deep a* level stabilizes the displaced H-DX\nThe fact that the H-DX structure is more stable than HO structure in the negative charge state indicates that as eF becomes close to the CBM, the HO can undergo a shallow-to-deep transition through a LLR. Figure 3 indicates that H-DX structure can be stable only for the eF close to CBM (eF . 0.05 eV below CBM). From the estimated pinning position of Fermi-level, we can estimate maximum electron concentration (ne,max) in H-rich ZnO, assuming the high concentration of HO, to be about 1018 cm23 at room temperature, which is surprisingly in a good agreement with the experimental data9–11.\nTherefore, we suggest that the present bistability can give an explanation to the doping limit puzzle for H-rich ZnO. As the eF is close to the CBM, HO can undergo the large lattice relaxation into H-DX2, and the electrons generated by HO are trapped in the deep H-DX a* level, i.e., the HO's are self-compensated.\nWe find that the bistability of HO can give explanation to the persistent photo-induced conductivity (PPC) reported for ZnO.\nZnO is well-known to be easily H-contaminated due to strong bonding between H and O atoms. In the H-rich and O-deficient ZnO, the concentrations of HO\n1 and H-DX2 states can be comparable due to the above-discussed self-compensation. The PPC effect can be explained by next process: (i) Since the H-DX structure is stable only in the negative charge state, the H-DX2 can be transformed into the HO structure, when an electron at H-DX state is excited by light illumination, and (ii) next it becomes spontaneously transformed into the HO\n1. The process is described as H-DX2 ) H-DX0 1 e R\n1 1 2e (')' indicates photo-excitation). Overall the deep H-DX2 state can be transformed into the shallow donor-like HO\n1 structure under light. By these processes, the concentration of free electrons can be increased, that describes the photo-induced conductivity. (iii)\nA larger energy barrier between HO and H-DX should prevent the structural recovery transformation from HO to H-DX at room-temperature. Thus, the photo-excited HO\n1 state is metastable but persistent, even in the presence of the high concentration of electron carriers at CBM. These results can give a good explanation to the metastable and persistent formation of shallow donor HO\n1 state can be transformed into the stable H-DX2 state at a temperature high enough to overcome the energy barrier of 0.36 eV. It can describe the thermal recovery process of the photoexcited HO\n1 state. The estimated energy barrier for the transition from HO to H-DX is in a good agreement with the experimental value of 0.3 eV17 for the energy barrier for thermal recovery of PPC state.\nSeghier and Gislason measured the photon energy spectrum for PPC17. The calculated optical absorption spectrum for H-DX state is found to be in a good agreement with the measured optical data17.\nThe peak in the calculated optical absorption spectrum of H-DX\naround 2.3 eV agrees with measured peak in the photon excitation spectrum for PPC effect at 2.15 eV. The minimum optical excitation energy (Eopt) of H-DX2 at about 1.06 eV, which comes from the electron excitation from a* level to CBM, also agrees with the measurement indicating *v1:3 eV. Therefore, we suggest that the bistability of HO should be an important source of persistent photoconductivity in ZnO. These propose that in order to prevent the light-induced instability of the ZnO-based devices, either hydrogen contamination or O-deficiency should be reduced. We would note that the scenario of the PPC by metastable VO\n20 suggested by Lany and Zunger works in the VO coupled by an H atom, which is HO.\nIn conclusion, we identify a bistability of shallow donor HO center in ZnO. We find that when Fermi level is close to CBM, the HO can undergo a large lattice relaxation and create a deep level, trapping electrons. It gives an explanation to the low doping limit in H-rich ntype ZnO. We find that H-DX2 is unstable against shallow-donor state HO by light-induced electron ionization, and there is a large energy barrier between HO\n1 and H-DX2 states. Thus, we suggest that the bistability of HO gives also a microscopic explanation for persistent photo-conductivity in ZnO. The bistability of the H donor will provide a new way to consider the physics of hydrogen in oxide materials.\nWe performed DFT calculations as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) code26. The projector augmented wave (PAW) pseudopotentials27,28, the plane wave basis set with a kinetic energy cutoff of 400 eV, and the hybrid functional of Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE)29with a mixing parameter of 0.375 and a screening parameter of 0.2 A˚ 21 were used. The calculated lattice constants (a 5 3.24 A˚ and c 5 5.23 A˚), the band gap (Eg 5 3.42 eV), and the heat of formation (DHf 5 23.13 eV) of ZnO were in good agreements with the other HSE calculations30,31 and the experiments32. With a hexagonal 96-atom supercell, a 2 3 2 3 2 k-point mesh including C was mainly used. All the atomic positions were fully optimized until the Hellmann-Feynman forces were less than 0.01 eV/A˚.\n1. Janotti, A. & Van de Walle, C. G. Fundamentals of zinc oxide as a semiconductor.\n2.

        "text": "Electrical Characterization Of Bce-Tfts With A-Igzto Oxide Semiconductor Compatible With Cu And Al Interconnections\nMototaka Ochi, Shinya Morita, Yasuyuki Takanashi, Hiroaki Tao, Hiroshi Goto, Toshihiro Kugimiya and Moriyoshi Kanamaru* Kobe Steel Ltd., Electronics Research Laboratory, 1-5-5 Takatsukadai, Nishi-ku, Kobe, Hyogo 651-2271, Japan \n* Kobelco Research Institute Inc., Sputtering Target Business, 2-3-1 Shinhama, Araicho, Takasago, Hyogo 676-8670, Japan\nWe have developed an amorphous In-Ga-Zn-Sn-O (a-IGZTO) semiconducting thin film for back channel etching (BCE) type thin-film transistors (TFTs). As the material is highly stable to acid etchants, the fabrication of the IGZTO TFTs having both Al and Cu interconnections is viable by back channel etching using conventional etchant such as PAN and H2O2-based etchants.\nOxide semiconductor, Back channel etch type TFT, Cu interconnection, Al interconnection \n1. Introduction\nTransparent amorphous oxide semiconductors such as amorphous In-Ga-Zn-O (a-IGZO) are recognized as channel materials not only for pixel switching/driving thin film transistors (TFTs)  but also those in gate/source driver circuits for high-resolution and large-screen active-matrix flat-panel displays as they have higher electron mobility and accommodate large-area substrates in mass production. \nFor back-plane TFTs using oxide semiconductor thin films, both etch stop layer (ESL)-type and back channel etch (BCE)-type structures have been developed in their mass production. The former have practical stability against gate bias and light illumination stress because of annihilation of defects at the interface between the oxide semiconductor layer and the ESL . The latter often suffer the unstable TFT operation against the various stresses. Nevertheless, the BCE-type TFTs are strongly desirable because they have considerable advantages owing to lesser process steps than those of the ESL-type TFTs . Further, the channel length of the BCE-TFTs corresponds to the shortest channel length (L) simply defined only limited by the patterning performance of source/drain (S/D) electrodes, as shown in Fig. 1. The BCE-structure also leads to reduce parasitic capacitances. \nGenerally, a-IGZO thin films are instantly etched out by conventional PAN etchant (mixture of phosphoric, acetic and nitric acid, common used for Al and Mo etching during S/D patterning process ) , which results in complicated and costly process integration for BCE-type TFT fabrication. Thus, we have developed the original transparent oxide semiconductor, consisting of amorphous In-Ga-Zn-Sn-O (a-IGZTO) thin films. \nThe a-IGZTO films have lesser solubility in PAN etchant by designing the metal composition . Unlike conventional a-IGZO films, where defects such as oxygen deficiency  tend to be induced during the manufacturing process of the BCE-TFTs, we have demonstrated that the BCE-type a-IGZTO TFTs, fabricated with wet-etching of Al interconnections, has a high stability under the illumination stress . \nIn addition, to meet the recent demand on further improvement of the performances as well as reduction of the fabrication cost of FPDs, the BCE-type a-IGZTO TFTs having Cu interconnections with Mo and Ti barrier metals have been developed.\n2. Experimental\nA cross section of the BCE-type TFTs is shown in Fig. 1. A \nMo metal that acts as a gate electrode was deposited on a glass substrate by DC magnetron sputtering. Then, a 250nm thick SiOx film was grown as a gate insulator by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) at 320 °C with gas mixtures of SiH4 and N2O. Either an a-IGZTO thin film or an a-IGZO thin film was formed by DC magnetron sputtering in a mixture of Ar and O2 gases at room temperature and patterned in photolithography as an active layer. The active layer was, then, annealed at 350 °C in air in order to improve the quality of the semiconductor film (hereafter referred as pre-annealing process. \nAfter the pre-annealing, S/D electrodes were formed by two different systems. The first set of samples consisted of Mo system S/D electrodes. A Mo single metal layer or a Mo/Cu/Mo stacked metal layer was deposited by sputtering, and patterned by wet etching process using a H2O2-based etchant for the Cu interconnection formation. The other system was Ti metal S/D electrodes deposited by sputtering and \npatterned using a H2O2-based etchant containing fluoride. Then, the passivation layer composed of double layered SiNx/SiOx was formed by PECVD without the recovery annealing between SiNx and SiOx. The TFTs were finally annealed at 250 °C in N2 atmosphere as the post-annealing process. \n Id-Vg characteristics of the TFTs were evaluated at room temperature using a semiconductor parameter analyzer. The stability of TFTs under the negative gate bias, thermal and illumination stress (NBTIS) was examined by the following stress conditions; the Vg and Vd were fixed at -20 and 10 V, \nrespectively, and a substrate temperature was set at 60 °C. The luminance during the NBTIS test was 25,000 cd/m2 (nit). In the present study the value of Vth was defined as Vth = Vth, 7200s - Vth, initial, where Vth, 7200s is the Vth value after 7200 sec and the Vth, initial is the initial Vth. The stability for both positive and negative gate bias thermal stresses (PBTS, NBTS) were also carried out under the condition of Vg = 20 V and Vd = 0.1 V for PBTS and Vg = -20 V and Vd = 10 V for NBTS at 60 °C. The duration of the stress test was 7200 s. \n3. Result And Discussion 3.1 Performance Of Tfts With Al Interconnection\nIn this section, the performances of TFTs with Al interconnections are reviewed. The S/D etching was carried out by PAN etchant. The electron saturation mobility (sat), \nthreshold voltage (Vth), subthreshold swing (SS) of the a-IGZTO BCE-TFTs prepared without recovery annealing between SiNx/SiOx for passivation layer were 7.9 cm2/Vs, 1.5 V and 0.36 V/decade, respectively. The value of the Vth after NBTIS test was approximately -9.75 V. On the other hand, the values of sat, Vth and SS obtained from the BCE-TFTs with the recovery annealing at 300 °C in air were 7.9 cm2/Vs, -1.0 V and 0.28 V/decade, respectively. The value of the Vth against the NBTIS \nwas improved to be approximately -1.75 V. \nAccording to SIMS depth profiles of O and OH obtain from the samples with and without the recovery annealing between SiNx/SiOx for passivation layer, the increase of OH on the surface of the active layer was detected, while that of O is not significant . It was considered that the annealing in air (recovery process) could bring OH bonds effectively onto the oxide surface which passivate the oxygen related defects. By futher improvements of the passivation process, the values of sat, Vth, and SS of the recent BCE-TFTs with the a-IGZTO thin film were 9.1 cm2/Vs, 0.5 V, and 0.20 V/decade, respectively. The value of the Vth against the NBTIS was maintained to be -1.75 V. It was also confirmed that the TFTs possessed Vth after the PBTS test of +1.75 V and Vth for NBTS of -0.5V. \n3.2 Mo Barrier Metal For Cu Interconnection\nThe influences of Mo barrier metal on S/D patterning in Cu-based BCE process were examined. Fig. 2 shows the etching rates of the Mo metal, a-IGZO thin film and a-IGZTO thin film for H2O2-based etchant. The etching rate of the a-IGZTO thin film is about a half of that of the a-IGZO thin film. Figs. 3 (a) \nand (b) show Id-Vg characteristics of the BCE-TFTs with the a-IGZTO thin films, which were over-etched by 50 % and 100 % against the Mo metal (100 nm) for S/D. In the case of over-etching of 50 %, the value of sat, Vth, and SS were 6.6 cm2/Vs, -4.5 V, and more than 1.0 V/decade, respectively. On the contrary, in the case of over-etching of 100 %, the values of sat, Vth, and SS were improved to be 7.2 cm2/Vs, 0.5 V, and 0.6 V/decade, respectively. \nIn order to clarify the origin of the difference in these BCE-TFTs due to the H2O2-based etching, the SIMS analysis for the BCE process samples was conducted. Figs. 4 show SIMS depth profiles of the BCE process samples for (a) over-etching of 50 % and (b) over-etching of 100 %. The results indicate that the Mo residues easily occurred at the interface between the SiOx thin film and the oxide thin film, which was different from the case of the PAN etchant. Thus, the degradation of the TFT switching characteristics was likely to due to the Mo residues. The Mo residues tend to be oxidized in the following BCE process carried out after the S/D wet-etching. According to our research, it is clearly found that the oxidized Mo residues, which are arranged next to the S/D electrodes, act as the acceptor-typed defects and induce the degradation of the SS value of the BCE-TFTs characteristics. Therefore, the sufficient over-etching is necessary to avoid the Mo residue for the practical use of the Mo barrier metal as S/D \nelectrodes and the H2O2-based etchant for the S/D wet-etching. \n3.3 Ti Barrier Metal For Cu Interconnection\nFigs. 5 show the etching rates of the Ti metal, a-IGZO thin film and a-IGZTO thin film for H 2 O 2 -based etchant containg fluoride. Figs. 6 show the Id-Vg characteristics of the BCE-TFTs with the a-IGZO and the a-IGZTO thin films fabricated under the different over-etching conditions. The S/D electrodes were over-etched by 20 %, 50 % and 100 % against the Ti metal (40 nm) for S/D . The optical microscope images are also shown in inset of Figs. 6. The Ti metal for S/D was patterned by H2O2-based etchant contaning fluoride in the BCE process. As shown in Fig. 5, the etching rate of the a-IGZTO thin film was reduced by 75 % compared with that of the a-IGZO thin film.\nConsequently, in the BCE-TFTs with the a-IGZO thin film, as the over-etching was increased, the channel thickness was greatly reduced from the initial value by the 20% over-etching and the\nchannel layer was completely disappeared after the over-etching of 50% and 100 %. On the other hand, in the BCE-TFTs with the a-IGZTO thin film, even when the over-etching was increased, the channel layer was clearly remained. The I d -V g characteristics of the a-IGZTO TFTs summarized as following; in the case of over-etching of 20 %, the values of µ sat , V th , and SS were 7.3 cm 2 /Vs, 1.5 V, and 0.2 V/decade, respectively. In the case of over-etching of 100 %, the values of µ sas . V th , and SS were 7.1 cm 2 /Vs, 2.0 V, and 0.2 V/decade, respectively.\nIn order to confirm the existence of Ti residues due to the H 2 O 2 -based etchant containing fluoride in the BCE-TFTs with the a-IGZTO thin film, SIMS analysis for the BCE process sample was conducted. Figs. 7 show the SIMS depth profiles of the BCE process sample that was over-etched by 50 %, as shown in Fig. 6 (e). The result indicates that the Ti residues occurred at the interface between the SiO x thin film and the oxide thin film as well as the Mo residues, in which the Mo S/D metal in the BCE-TFTs was patterned using the H 2 O 2 -based etchant [see Fig.\n4 (a)]. However, it is obvious that the Ti residues have not affected the characteristics degradation such as SS value on the BCE-TFTs.\n, on ass [1,202,60/61] no cased .\nvog on soping VO tasn to solve solveradel only\n3.4 BCE-TFTs reliability characteristics using IGZTO \nFinally, the characteristics of the BCE-TFTs with the a-IGZTO thin film were summarized in Table 1. The BCE-TFTs, fabricated with the Mo/Cu/Mo and the Ti metal layers for S/D, were prepared for Cu interconnection process. The former Mo/Cu/Mo was patterned by the over-etching of 100 % using the H2O2-based etchant and the latter Ti metal was patterned by the over-etching of 50 % using the H2O2-based etchant containing fluoride. After the Mo/Cu/Mo or single Ti was completely dissolved, the time equivalent to the 50 % or 100 % of the time for complete etching duration was added as the over-etching. As a reference, the BCE-TFT fabricated by the Mo/Al/Mo for S/D was prepared for Al interconnection process (PAN etchant). Considering the suppression of formation of the oxygen deficiency due to the H2O2-based etchant on the oxide semiconductor surface, this result without the recovery annealing indicates that the Vth of NBTIS is notably small. \n| Process                       |          |          |               |\n|-------------------------------|----------|----------|---------------|\n| S/D electrode                 | Mo/Al/Mo | Mo/Cu/Mo | Ti            |\n| S/D barrier metal             | Mo       | Mo       | Ti            |\n| S/D etchant                   | PAN      | H2O2     | H2O2+flouride |\n| sat (cm2/Vs)                 | 9.1      | 7.2      | 7.3           |\n| Vth (V)                       | 0.5      | 0.75     | 1.0           |\n| SS (V/decade)                 | 0.2      | 0.4      | 0.2           |\n| Vth for PBTS (V)             | 1.8      | 4.5      | 3.3           |\n| Vth for NBTS (V)             | 0.5      | 1.3      | 0.3           |\n| Vth for NBTIS (V)            | 1.8      | 1.5      | 2.5           |\n| BCE-TFT using IGZTO thin film |          |          |               |\n4. Conclusion\nWe have developed the a-IGZTO thin film which realizes high etching selectivity against various acid etchant by designing the metal composition consisting of oxide semiconductor films. It is confirmed that the fabricated BCE-type TFTs with the a-IGZTO thin film are compatible with Cu interconnection using not only the Mo barrier metal but also the Ti barrier metal. Although the fabrication of the BCE-type TFTs with the conventional a-IGZO thin film is difficult because of large thickness reduction during the S/D patterning process, the a-IGTZO thin film enables the TFT fabrication due to its high acid resistance. According to our studies on the a-IGZTO semiconductor thin film, it is now possible for both the Al and the Cu interconnection for S/D to fabricate the good performance BCE-TFTs. "

The purpose of this review is to provide a theoretical description of compact models of TFTs with different active layers, such as polysilicon, amorphous silicon, organic and In-Ga-Zn-O (IGZO) semiconductors. Special attention is paid to the surface-potential-based compact models of silicon-based TFTs. With the understanding of both the charge transport characteristics and the requirement of TFTs in organic and IGZO TFTs, we have proposed the surface-potential-based compact models and the parameter extraction techniques. The proposed models can provide accurate circuit-level performance prediction and RFID circuit design, and pass the Gummel symmetry test (GST). Finally; the outlook on the compact models of TFTs is briefly discussed.\nKeywords: **thin-film transistors (TFTs); compact model; surface potential**\n1. Introduction\nA thin-film transistors (TFTs) is a special kind of field-effect transistor (FET) fabricated by depositing thin films of an active semiconductor layer, as well as the dielectric layer and metallic contacts over a supporting (but non-conducting) substrate . In the past 15 years, TFTs has grown into a huge industry based on display, memory, E-paper applications, and so on [3–6]. Generally, a common substrate in TFTs is glass, which differs from the conventional transistor, where the semiconductor material typically is the substrate, such as a silicon wafer. TFTs include three basic elements: (1) a thin semiconductor film; (2) an insulating layer; and (3) three electrodes (gate, source and drain) [7–9]. Three basic elements for configuration of TFT have been illustrated clearly in Figure 1.\nThe source and drain, are in contact with the semiconductor film at a short distance from one another. The gate is separated from the semiconductor film by the insulating layer .\nThe history of TFT really began with the work of P. K. Weimer at Radio Corporation of America\n(RCA) Laboratories in 1962 . At that time Weimer fabricated the first TFT based on thin films of polycrystalline cadmium sulfide as the semiconductor materials. In the 1970s, the realization of crystalline silicon as the active materials with low cost dramatically changed the prospects of TFTs . In 1979, amorphous silicon as a new active material was introduced by LeComber et al. , which had profound implications for TFTs. In 1980, Depp et al. reported polysilicon TFT which achieved good mobility and TFT characteristics . In 1986, the first transistor based on organic semiconductor was reported . As compared with conventional Si TFTs, organic TFT (OTFT) displays much less complex in fabrication processes and can be naturally compatible with plastic substrates for lightweight and foldable products . To develop large-scale TFTs, processing temperatures must be getting lower and lower. In 2004, Nomura et al. used a complex In-Ga-Zn-O (IGZO) semiconductor layer in a TFT,\nwhich achieved the room-temperature processing of the semiconductor layer . Looking back into the past half-century, TFTs moved endlessly forward from the initial requirement of performance to today's application of large area and low cost.\nDuring the development of TFTs, the semiconductor device model represents an essential bridge between the semiconductor manufactures and the circuit design. Integrated circuit (IC) designers usually utilize various kinds of software (such as Cadence, SPICE, PHILIPAC) for design circuit [18–20].\nThe core of the corresponding software is the model of each unit device. Because the IC is consisted of several transistors, if all unit devices would need to run the complicated model of transistor, the system level simulation will beyond computer ability and hence causes non-convergence in calculation. Otherwise, for ensuring the reliability of the simulation, the device model should also be able to accurately describe the physical properties . Compact model is a critical step in the design cycle of modern IC products . It refers to the development of models for integrated semiconductor devices for use in circuit simulations. Compact model is usually used to reproduce device terminal behaviors with accuracy, computational efficiency, ease of parameter extraction, and relative model simplicity for a circuit or system-level simulation, for future technology nodes .\nAccurate and physical compact models are essential for digital and analog circuits. Generally speaking, an excellent compact model should include the following requirements :(i) Representing consistently the behavior; (ii) Being symmetrical to reflect the symmetry of TFT\nstructure; (iii) Being analytical, without differentials or integrals; (iv) Being simple and easily derivable;\n(v) Parameters that can be characterized easily, or even guessed; (vi) Being upgradable and reducible;\n(vii) Relations can be physically justified; (viii) Being similar form and correspondence to compact models for other TFTs; (ix) Being tunable to inaccurate (or uncertain) experimental data.\nThe first compact model could date back to 1983, in which Kacprzak et al. proposed a compact DC\nmodel of GaAs FETs for large-signal computer calculation . In 1986, based on one-dimensional (1-D)\nsolution of Poisson's equation, Ahmed et al. reported a compact model for accumulation mode poly-Si devices . Later, plenty of methods, such charge sheet model, effective medium approach (EMA),\nsemi-empirical approach, generation-recombination model, and surface-potential based model, have been introduced for the compact models of the silicon-based TFTs [27–32]. Then, with the emergence of new TFTs, e.g., OTFT and IGZO TFTs, some excellent compact models based on interesting methods have been developed [33–37]. Strictly speaking, all of the proposed compact models can be divided into two categories. One is charge-based and another is surface-potential-based. As compared with the charge-based model, the surface-potential-based compact model is believed to have high accuracy and strong physical property, and be easily simplified into the charge-based and threshold-voltage-based model . It can also describe the operation of transistor more accurately without any smooth functions .\nOver the past two decades, although some excellent reviews have been published [39–42],\na completed review for the compact models of TFTs based on different active materials is still lacking. In this review, we will provide an updated review of surface-potential-based compact model of TFTs with different active materials, such as polysilicon, amorphous silicon, organic and IGZO semiconductors. In Section **2, the charge transport property of different active materials is**\ndiscussed. In Section **3, we discuss the surface-potential-based compact models for silicon-based TFTs** and presented our surface-potential-based compact models for organic and IGZO TFTs, respectively.\nIn Section **4, the comparison of various compact models will be summarized. Finally, the future outlook** for this field is briefly discussed in Section 5.\n2. Charge Transport Property\nIn order to achieve an accurate compact model for TFTs, the key is to correctly describe the charge transport characteristics. For TFTs with different active materials, the charge transport has displayed various properties. This section will, in detail, introduce the charge transport properties of TFTs for different active materials.\n2.1. Grain-Boundary Trapping Theory\nBased on its structure characteristics, the charge transport property of polysilicon has been described in terms of two distinct models: segregation theory and grain-boundary trapping theory .\nIn the segregation theory, impurity atoms tend to segregate at the grain boundary where they are electrically inactive. While the grain boundary trapping theory assumed that the presence of a large amount of trapping states at the grain boundary able to capture, and therefore immobilize, free carriers.\nThe basic limitation of segregation theory is that it does not explain the temperature dependence of the film resistivity which is thermally activated and exhibits a negative temperature coefficient.\nThe grain-boundary trapping theory can explain most of electrical properties in polysilicon.\nIn the grain-boundary trapping theory, a polysilicon is assumed to be composed of small crystallites joined together by the grain boundaries usually consisted of a few atomic layers of disordered atoms . Inside each crystallite the atoms are arranged in a periodic manner so that it can be considered as a small single crystal. Atoms in the grain boundary represent a transitional region between the different orientations of neighboring crystallites. Although polysilicon is a three-dimensional substance, it is sufficient to treat the problem in one dimension to calculate the transport properties. The traps are assumed to be initially neutral and become charged by trapping a carrier. Figure 2 **shows the schematic diagram of crystal structure, charge distribution and energy**\nband structure of polysilicon films.\nThe grain-boundary trapping theory considers just the resistance of the grain-boundary region, which includes two important contributions to the current: thermionic emission and tunneling (field emission) . Thermionic emission results from those carriers possessing high enough energy to surmount the potential barrier at the grain boundary. The tunneling current arises from carriers with energy less than the barrier height. When the barrier is narrow and high, the tunneling current can become comparable to or larger than the thermionic emission current. In the polysilicon the potential barrier is the highest when the barrier width is the widest. Because of this, tunneling current may be neglected. Then, for an applied voltage the thermionic emission current density across a grain boundary following Bethe is expressed as the following :\n$$J_{t h}=q p_{a}\\biggl(\\frac{k_{B}T}{2m^{*}\\pi}\\biggr)^{1/2}e x p\\biggl(-\\frac{q V_{B}}{k_{B}T}\\biggr)\\left[e x p\\biggl(-\\frac{q V_{a}}{k_{B}T}\\biggr)-1\\right]$$\nwhere q is the elemental charge, pa is the average carrier concentration, m∗**is the effective mass of**\nthe carrier, kB is the Boltzmann constant, VB is the potential barrier height, and Va **is the applied**\nvoltage. Equation (1) neglects collisions within the depletion region and the carrier concentration in the crystallite was assumed to be independent of the current flow, so that it is applicable only if the number of carriers taking part in the current transport is small compared to the total number of carriers in the crystallite. This condition restricts the barrier height to be larger than or comparable to kBT. If Va is small, qVa ≪ kBT**, Equation (1) can be expanded to give the following:**\n$$J_{t h}=q^{2}p_{a}\\biggl(\\frac{1}{2\\pi m^{*}k_{B}T}\\biggr)^{1/2}e x p\\biggl(-\\frac{q V_{B}}{k_{B}T}\\biggr)V_{a}$$\nwhich is a linear current–voltage relationship. Based on Equation (2), the conductivity of a polysilicon film with a grain size L **is written as:**\n$$\\sigma=L q^{2}p_{a}\\biggl(\\frac{1}{2\\pi m^{*}k_{B}T}\\biggr)^{1/2}e x p\\biggl(-\\frac{q V_{B}}{k_{B}T}\\biggr)$$\nThen, the effective mobility is expressed as:\n$$\\mu_{e f f}=L q\\biggl(\\frac{1}{2\\pi m^{*}k_{B}T}\\biggr)^{1/2}e x p\\biggl(-\\frac{E_{b}}{k_{B}T}\\biggr)$$\nhere Ebis the energy barrier.\n2.2. Hopping Transport\nDiffering from crystalline materials, such as polysilicon, the charge transport in amorphous materials exhibits very different properties. Amorphous semiconductor materials, including inorganic and organic, have in common, that their atomic or molecular structure is completely disordered.\nFor inorganic amorphous semiconductors, such as, pure and hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si, a-Si:H), a band structure similar to the one of crystalline materials still exists . The electronic states in the conduction and valence bands are therefore delocalized. Thus some of the concepts from crystalline semiconductor physics are still suitable for the inorganic amorphous materials. However, in the band gap between valence and conduction band, some localized states exist in which charge carriers can be trapped. For organic amorphous semiconductors, the intermolecular bonds are due to relatively weak van der Waals interactions, the electronic wave functions usually do not extend over the entire volume of the organic solid, but rather, are localized to a finite number of molecules, or even to individual molecules . Due to the spatial and energetic disorder, the charge transport in amorphous semiconductor materials is limited by trapping in the localized states. This means that the charge carrier mobility is expected to be thermally activated, that is, the charge transport always happens to jump from one localized site to another. This type of transport mechanism is called hopping transport. The transition of hopping between two sites depends on the overlap of the electronic wave functions of these two sites . Whenever a charge carrier hops to a site with a higher (lower) site energy than the site that it came from, the difference in energy is accommodated for by the absorption\n(emission) of a phonon. Figure 3 **is a schematic diagram of carrier hopping transport with the density**\nThe intrinsic transition rate for a carrier hopping from an initial site i to an empty site j **is expressed**\nby γij = γRij, Ei − Ej\n.

Multiple Trapping And Release Theory\nFor some special materials, such as the small-molecule organic semiconductor and the IGZO semiconductor, which have a strong tendency to form polycrystalline films .\nThese semiconductors display the regular arrangement, and the delocalized orbitals partially overlap, thereby facilitating more efficient charge transfer and carrier mobility that is much larger than in amorphous films. The charge transport properties of these materials cannot be explained by the grain-boundary trapping theory and hopping transport. In contrast to the grain-boundary trapping theory or hopping theory, the multiple trapping and release (MTR) theory is adapted for the materials . MTR theory assumes that the charge transport occurs in extended states, and that most of the charge carriers are trapped in localized states . Energy of localized state is separated from mobility edge energy. When the energy of localized state is slightly lower mobility edge, then the extended states acts as shallow trap, from which the charge carrier can be released (emitted) by the thermal excitations. But, if that energy is far below mobility edge energy, then charge carriers cannot be thermally excited (emitted). The number of carriers available for transport depends on the difference in energy between the trap level and the extended-state band. Figure 4 **is a transport diagram of**\nIn the MTR theory, total charge carriers' densities, n*total***, is equal to sum of density in extended**\nstates, ne**, and in localized states, as in Ref. :**\n$$n_{t o t a l}=n_{e}+\\int_{-\\infty}^{0}g(E){\\hat{f}}(E)d E$$\nwhere the upper limit of integral E = 0 corresponds to the mobility edge, g(E) **is the trap density**\n݂(ܧ = (ቆ1 + ݁ݔ ቀாିா(௫)\n(ݔ)ܧ of states (DOS) energy distribution. f(E) =\n−1**is the Fermi–Dirac distribution,**\nEf(x) **is the quasi-Fermi level. Two methods within the MTR theory usually describe the effect of**\ntrapping . One is that, all carrier fields induced can contribute to the current flow at any moment of time, but the effective mobility is reduced in comparison with its intrinsic, trap-free value:\n$$\\mu_{e f f}=\\mu_{0}(T)\\frac{\\tau(T)}{\\tau(T)+\\tau_{t r}(T)}$$\nhere, µ0 is the carrier mobility in extended state, τtr(T) **is the average trapping time on shallow traps,**\nand τ(T) is the average time that a polaron spends diffusively traveling between the consecutive\ntrapping events. Another is that only a fraction of the carrier field induced is moving at any given\n$$n_{e f f}=n_{t o t a l}{\\frac{\\tau(T)}{\\tau(T)+\\tau_{t r}(T)}}$$\nΤ(T) + Τtr(T)(9) 3. Surface-Potential-Based Compact Models\nIn spite of the fact that the transport characteristics in TFTs is very different for different active materials, the current–voltage characteristics can, to first order, be described with the same formalism as :\n$$I_{ds}=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll}\\frac{\\mu C_{l}W}{L}\\bigg{(}\\big{(}V_{g}-V_{th}\\big{)}V_{ds}-\\frac{V_{g}^{2}}{2}\\bigg{)}&\\mbox{for}|V_{g}-V_{th}|>|V_{ds}|\\mbox{(linear regime)}\\\\ \\frac{\\mu C_{l}W}{2L}\\big{(}V_{g}-V_{th}\\big{)}^{2}&\\mbox{for}|V_{ds}|>|V_{g}-V_{th}|>0\\mbox{(saturation regime)}\\end{array}\\right.\\tag{10}$$\n$$({\\mathfrak{g}})$$\nwhere Equation (10) describes the relationship between the drain current Ids**, the gate-source voltage**\nVg and the drain-source voltage Vds in linear and saturation regimes, respectively. Ci**is the gate**\ndielectric capacitance per unit area, µ **is the carrier mobility in the semiconductor, W and L is the**\nchannel width and length of the transistor, respectively. For silicon TFTs, the threshold voltage Vth is defined as the minimum gate-source voltage required to induce strong inversion . However OTFTs and IGZO TFTs usually operate in accumulation region, thus strictly speaking the threshold voltage cannot be defined for OTFTs and IGZO TFTs. Since the threshold voltage concept is nonetheless useful, the compact models will show very different for TFTs with different active materials. Otherwise, the central aim of compact models is to accurately and physically describe the current–voltage characteristics of TFTs in Equation (10). As mentioned above, the surface-potential-based compact model is believed to have high accuracy and strong physical properties. The following will review the surface-potential-based compact models for polysilicon and amorphous silicon TFTs, and then present our compact models for OTFTs and IGZO TFTs based on surface-potential-based.\n3.1. Polysilicon Tft Compact Models\nPolysilicon TFTs have gotten considerable applications, especially in active matrix liquid crystal displays (AMLCDs), printers, scanners, Static Random-Access Memories (SRAMs) and three-dimensional large scale integration (LSI) circuits . In early time, researchers usually built the polysilicon TFT models based on the one-dimensional solution of Poisson's equation and the effects of grain-boundary traps . However, these earlier models were unclear for inversion mode devices due to the \"reverse\" charge shielding concept defined in its derivation . Later, some authors adopted the EMA method to well address the question of non-uniform polysilicon sample with the grain boundaries . In 1999, Benjamí**n et al. also adopted EMA to develop a unified model**\nfor long and short-channel polysilicon TFTs . This method is attractive because it accounts for field effect mobility enhancement in the moderate inversion regime and for mobility degradation at high gate voltages, for drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL) effect, kink effect, off-state current and channel-length modulation. A few years later, Wu et al. proposed a compact model by approximating the generation rate for poly Si TFTs in the leakage region . Although several models for poly-Si TFTs have been proposed so far, based on different equations for the subthreshold, linear, and saturation regions , these methods always lead to a significant error in evaluating derivatives such as transconductance .\nTo capture more accurate features of poly-Si TFTs, Shimizu et al. developed a compact model based on a new surface-potential-based . Firstly, in the model the states are approximated by the sum of exponential distributions for the deep and tail states as:\n$$g(E)=g_{d e}e x p\\left({\\frac{E-E_{c}}{E_{d e}}}\\right)+g_{t a}e x p\\left({\\frac{E-E_{c}}{E_{t a}}}\\right)$$\nwhere Ede and Eta are the inverse slope of deep states and tail states, respectively, gde and gta **are the**\ndensity of deep state and tail state at bottom of conduction band Ec**, respectively.**\nBy integrating the 1-D Poisson equation, the surface potentials at the source side as a function of gate voltage can be calculated numerically as the following :\nβ[exp(−βϕs0) − exp(−βϕb0) + β(ϕs0 − ϕb0)\nNsub 2[exp(βϕs0) − exp(βϕb0)] +\nγNsub [exp(γϕs0) − exp(γϕb0)]\nఉ+ (߮ − ௦߮(ߚ + (߮ߚ−)ݔ݁ − (௦**߮ߚ−)ݔ݁ቈ**\nଶቀఉே + ሿ)߮ߚ)ݔ݁ − (௦߮ߚ)ݔ݁ሾఊேೞೠ್\nቁ ሾ݁ݔ)ߛ߮௦) − ݁ݔ)ߛ߮(ሿ + ቀேೌ\nNsub [exp(βϕs0) − exp(βϕb0)]i 12\nwhere γ = q/Ede, β is the inverse of thermal voltage, εs**is the dielectric constant,** Nsub **is the dopant**\nconcentration, niis the intrinsic carrier concentration, ϕs0 and ϕb0 **are the front and back surface**\npotentials at the source side, respectively, N*deep* and N*tail* **are the densities of trapped electrons in deep**\nstates and tail states under a flat band condition, respectively.\nThen, the inversion layer charge density at the source (x = 0) or drain (x = L**) side can be written**\nas  the following:\n௦௨ܰ ௦ߝ ߚ ௗ**ܧ/ݍ = ߛ**\n$$\\begin{array}{l}{{Q_{i}(x)=-C_{i}\\Big(V_{g}-V_{f b}-\\varphi_{g0}\\Big)+\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma_{i}N_{u a b}}{\\beta}}[e x p(-\\beta\\varphi_{x x})-e x p(-\\beta\\varphi_{x x})+\\beta(\\varphi_{x x}-\\varphi_{b x})]}}\\\\ {{\\qquad+\\Big(\\frac{\\beta N_{u a b}}{\\gamma N_{u a b}}\\Big)[e x p(\\gamma\\varphi_{x x})-e x p(\\gamma\\varphi_{b x})]+\\Big(\\frac{N_{u a b}}{N_{u a b}}\\Big)[e x p(\\beta\\varphi_{x x})-e x p(\\beta\\varphi_{b x})]\\Big]^{\\frac{1}{2}}}}}\\end{array}$$\nObviously, Equations (12) and (13) could be only solved by iteration. To determine the surface potentials at the source side or at the drain side, the authors used a method from the literature .\nIn Equation (13), the charge densities of inversion layer are derived based on the charge-sheet approximation. Figure 5 **shows a comparison of the front surface potentials obtained from Equation (12)** and the exact numerical calculations.\nAfter obtaining the surface potentials, based on the drift-diffusion approximation , the authors calculated the drain current as:\n$$I_{ds}=\\frac{W_{M}}{L^{\\beta}}\\left[C_{i}\\Big{(}\\beta\\Big{(}V_{g}-V_{fb}\\Big{)}+1\\Big{)}(\\varphi_{sL}-\\varphi_{s0})-\\frac{\\beta}{2}C_{i}\\big{(}\\varphi_{sL}^{2}-\\varphi_{s0}^{2}\\big{)}-\\frac{\\beta}{2}(q_{i}(0)+(L))\\right.\\tag{14}$$ $$\\left.(\\varphi_{sL}-\\varphi_{s0})-(q_{i}(0)-q_{i}(L))\\right]$$\nwhere ϕsL and ϕbL **are the front and back surface potentials at the drain side, respectively,**\nqi(x) = Qi(x) + Ci Vg − Vf b − ϕsx. Note, Equation (14) can describe the drain current in all\nݍܳ = (ݔ)௦௫൯߮ − ܸ − ܸ൫ܥ + (ݔ)\nthe regions of operation using the unified equation. At the same time, the model did not include the threshold voltage.\nFigure 6 shows a comparison of simulated and measured drain current characteristics as a function of gate voltage for an n-channel poly-Si TFT in the subthreshold and above-threshold regions. In the linear and saturation regions, a comparison of simulated and measured drain current characteristics is shown in Figure 7 .\nhave developed an analytical solution to the surface potential of poly-Si TFIs by using the Lambert W\nfunction [ 72 ]. In Chen et al.'s model, the surface potential of poly-Si TFTs can be expressed as,\n$$\\left(V_{g}-V_{fb}-\\varphi_{s}\\right)^{2}=\\gamma^{2}\\bigg{[}\\bigg{(}1+\\frac{N_{T}}{L_{g}NA_{A}}\\bigg{)}\\varphi_{s}+\\varphi_{t}exp\\bigg{(}\\frac{\\varphi_{s}-\\varphi_{n}-2\\varphi_{f}}{\\varphi_{t}}\\bigg{)}\\bigg{]}-\\frac{N_{T}}{L_{g}NA_{A}}\\varphi_{t}\\ln(1+K_{m})\\tag{15}$$\n$\\sqrt{1+x^2+4x^2}$ 4. \nwhere qs is the surface potential, γ denotes a body factor: γ = √ 2 εsqN λ /C i , L 8 is the grain size, N T and N A are located traps and acceptor density, respectively, φ t is the thermal voltage, φ f is the Fermi potential, φ n is the channel voltage, K m = 0.5exp ( E t t g P 1 ). To derive an analytical and non-iterative evaluation, the normalized form of Equation (15) can be written as the following:\n$$\\left(v_{g}-x_{W}\\right)^{2}=G_{T F T}^{2}[x_{W}+\\Delta_{T F T}\\exp(x_{W})+A A]$$\n$$(16)^{\\frac{1}{2}}$$\nwhere xW = ϕs/ϕt**is the normalized surface potential,** vg =\nVg − Vf b/ϕt **the normalized effective**\ngate voltage, GTFT = γ q1+NT/LgNA\nϕt, ∆TFT = exp −ϕt−2ϕf ϕt\nThen, with a simple mathematical procedure and using the principal branch of the Lambert W\nfunction , the authors obtained the physics-based analytical solution of the normalized surface potential as follows:\n$$x_{W}=-W_{0}[f\\!f\\!\\times\\Delta_{T F T}e x p(v_{G}-f\\times A)]+v_{G}-f\\!f\\times A A$$\nwhere $v_{G}=\\left(v_{g}+\\frac{G_{ET}^{2}}{2}\\right)-G_{FET}\\sqrt{v_{g}+G_{TT}^{2}/4}$ and $f=G_{FET}/2\\sqrt{v_{g}+G_{TT}^{2}/4}$.  In order to use the above we can use a constant to be unity at the other large scale.  \nIn order to improve the accuracy, some corrections by using the Schroder series in the surface potential expression have been provided for Equation (17). Finally, the complete solution to the physics-based surface potential of poly-Si TFTs with absolute error only in nanovolt range can be expressed as:\nϕs =-xW + ωyW, y′W, y\n$\\varphi_{s}=\\left[x\\right]$\n![10_image_0.png](10_image_0.png)\nᇱᇱ ) **+ ߝሿ߮**௧ Based on Equation (18), the surface potential derivative with respect to the gate voltage has been calculated , as shown in Figure 8. Figure 8 **shows that no splits and peaks exist near the flatband**\nregions, which suggests that the analytical solution to the surface potential is better than the algorithm in the Penn State Philips (PSP) model .\nBased on the formulas of surface potential from Chen et al., subsequently some researchers presented a complete modeling for surface potential in partially depleted poly-Si TFTs with undoped or lightly doped body by including both monoenergetic and exponential trap distributions .\nThe proposed closed-form algorithm is able to accurately calculate the surface potential and has the advantage of both accuracy and computational efficiency, which is useful for compact modeling and CAD applications.\n3.2. Amorphous Silicon Tfts\nAmorphous Silicon, especially hydrogenated amorphous-silicon (a-Si:H), has been considered as the most well-studied materials for TFTs. Generally speaking, the most important features of amorphous silicon TFT characteristics can be described by analyzing the device behavior in two regimes: below-threshold, when the electron quasi-Fermi level is in the deep states; and above-threshold, when the Fermi level enters the tail states . A current model for the below- and above-threshold regimes had been proposed by considering the sheet carrier density as a function of Fermi lever position by Shur et al. . In 1997, Shur et al. again developed a physically based analytical model for n-channel amorphous silicon thin film transistors and for nand p-channel polysilicon thin film transistors, which covered all regimes of transistor operation:\nleakage, subthreshold, above-threshold conduction, and the kink regime in polysilicon thin film transistors . Only in the last few years several models have been built, based on the description of below-threshold and above-threshold, respectively [77–79]. However, with gradual accumulation of the requirements imposed on the compact models and simultaneous realization of the limitations associated with the traditional modeling techniques, new physical phenomena become essential for the accurate reproduction of the device characteristics. On the other hand, due to these drawbacks in the regional approach, analytical models based on surface potential have been paid more attentions in the development of device models .\nIn terms of the consideration above, in 2008, Liu et al. presented an analytical a-Si:H TFTs model based on the surface potential . In the model, when TFT is biased, the majority of the induced charges in the channel are trapped in the acceptor-like states, which divided into two groups: deep states and tail states. The distribution of localized acceptor states can be expressed as Equation (11).\nThe localized trapped charge density is expressed as:\n$$n_{t r a p p e d}=\\int_{-\\infty}^{E_{c}}{\\frac{g(E)}{1+{\\frac{1}{g}}e x p{\\left({\\frac{E-E_{f}}{k_{B}T}}\\right)}}}$$\nhere g **is the degenerescence factor of localized states. When the density of trapped charges in the tail** states are considered, the integral (Equation (19)) can be rewritten as  the following:\n$$n_{t a i l}=g_{t}g^{T/T_{0}}\\frac{k_{B}T}{q}f(T,T_{t})e x p\\frac{q\\varphi-q V_{c h}(y)-E_{f0}}{k_{B}T_{0}}$$\nwhere gtis the tail states density at Ec, Ttis the tail state characteristic temperature, Vch **stands for the**\nchannel quasi-Fermi level which is the channel voltage equal to 0 at the source and Vds **at the drain.**\nTo obtain the potential, the authors then solved the Poisson's equation:\n $\\dfrac{\\partial^2\\varphi}{\\varphi x^2}=-\\dfrac{dF}{dx}=\\dfrac{q}{\\varepsilon_s}\\Big(n_{deep}+n_{tail}+n_{free}\\Big)$  are the densities for deep trap, free, tail, trap, charges, respect. \nwhere ndeep, n*tail* and n*f ree* **are the densities for deep trap, free, tail trap charges, respectively,**\nnf ree = Ncexpqϕs−qVch (y)−Ef 0 kBT\n**. According to Gauss' law, and introducing electrical field effect,**\nthe relationship between the gate-source voltage and the surface potential can be found as follows\nCi Vg − Vf b − ϕs = rtεsexpqϕs−qVch (y)−Ef 0 kBT0 + rdεsexpqϕs−qVch (y)−Ef 0 kBTd  +rfεsexpqϕs−qVch (y)−Ef 0 kBT  (22) here rt = r2kBT0 gtg T/T0 f(T,Tt)kBT qεs, rd = s2kBTd gd g T/TdπkBT qεssinπT Td  and rf = q2kBTNc εs. To derive analytical and noniterative evaluation from Equation (22), the normalized form of\nEquation (22) can be written as follows:\n(xg − x) = Gtexp(x − xn) + Gd[exp(x − xn)]T0/Td + Gf[exp(x − xn)]T0/T**(23)**\nwhere $xg=-\\frac{V_{2}-V_{D}}{2V_{D}}$, $x=\\frac{g_{0}}{2V_{D}}$, $xn=\\frac{\\frac{r_{D}}{r_{D}}+V_{A}\\ (s)}{2V_{D}}$, $G_{I}=\\frac{\\gamma_{0}g_{I}}{2V_{D}}$, $G_{d}=\\frac{r_{d}g_{r}}{2V_{D}}$, $G_{f}=\\frac{r_{f}\\nu_{r}}{2V_{D}}$, and $V_{D}=\\frac{L_{0}T_{0}}{q}$.  \nThen, by using the two-order Taylor expansion, the solution for the surface potential of amorphous silicon TFTs is expressed by:\nBased on the solution for the surface potential of amorphous silicon TFTs, the authors compared the analytical results with the numerical results, as shown in Figure 9a. And the absolute errors of the new analytical approximation were shown in Figure 9 b. The absolute errors introduced by analytical approximation are less than 0.02 V in all cases.\n![12_image_0.png](12_image_0.png)\nAfter the surface potential is solved precisely, the authors then discussed the drain current by dividing the new derivation of the DC model into the below threshold region and the above threshold region.\n$$\\begin{array}{l}{{I_{d s d}=\\mu_{n}\\frac{W}{L}N_{c}\\varepsilon_{s}\\frac{2k_{B}T_{d}k_{B}T}{k_{B}T_{d}-k_{B}T}\\left(\\frac{1}{r\\phi_{s s}}\\right)^{\\frac{2T_{d}}{T}}\\alpha_{c l}^{\\frac{2T_{d}}{T}-1}\\left[\\frac{T}{2T_{d}}\\left(\\Delta\\varphi_{s s}^{\\frac{2T_{d}}{T}}-\\Delta\\varphi_{s d}^{\\frac{2T_{d}}{T}}\\right)\\right.}}\\\\ {{\\left.+2V_{t d}\\frac{T}{2T_{d}-T}\\left(\\Delta\\varphi_{s s}^{\\frac{2T_{d}}{T}-1}-\\Delta\\varphi_{s d}^{\\frac{2T_{d}}{T}-1}\\right)\\right]}}\\end{array}$$\nBelow threshold region, the static current of amorphous TFTs is written as:\nAbove threshold region, similarly, the expression of drain current in the above threshold regime can be obtained as:\n$$\\begin{array}{l}{{I_{d s t}=\\mu_{n}\\frac{W}{L}N c_{s}e^{\\frac{2E_{0}T_{0}k_{B}T}{2E_{0}T_{0}-k_{B}T}}\\left(\\frac{1}{r e s}\\right)^{\\frac{2T_{0}}{L}}e^{\\frac{2T_{0}}{T_{0}}-1}\\left[\\frac{T}{2T_{0}}\\left(\\Delta\\varphi_{s s}^{\\frac{2T_{0}}{L}}-\\Delta\\varphi_{s d}^{\\frac{2T_{0}}{L}}\\right)\\right.}}\\\\ {{\\left.+2V_{t n}\\frac{T}{2T_{0}-T}\\left(\\Delta\\varphi_{s s}^{\\frac{2T_{0}}{L}-1}-\\Delta\\varphi_{s d}^{\\frac{2T_{0}}{L}-1}\\right)\\right]}}\\end{array}$$\nAccording to the expression of drain current, the calculated transfer characteristics for a-Si:H\nTFT is shown in Figure 10 a.  It is noted that a smooth transition is achieved in the below- and above-threshold regions without any use of smooth functions. Furthermore, the threshold voltage is not required in the whole calculations. Figure 10 b displays the measured characteristics and the calculated current–voltage characteristics of an a-Si:H TFT. It is demonstrated that the model exhibits a reasonable agreement in both the linear region and the saturation region.\n![12_image_1.png](12_image_1.png)\n![13_image_0.png](13_image_0.png)\nTo calculate the surface potential, other methods have been used. For example, very recently, Qin et al. developed a novel scheme for surface potential of amorphous silicon TFTs by taking deep Gaussian and tail exponential distribution of the density of states into account . In Qin et al.'s model, the authors adopted Taylor expansion below threshold regime, and the principle of Lamber W function and Schroder series above threshold regime, as well as Chen et al.'s model in Section **3.1.**\n3.3. OTFT Compact Models In OTFTs, the energy disorder is usually described by Gaussian DOS as :\n$$g(E)={\\frac{N_{t}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma}}e x p\\biggl(-{\\frac{E^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}}\\biggr)$$\nwhere Ntis the total localized states, and σ **indicates the width of the DOS. By connecting Gauss law**\n= εsF(0)**, one can obtain the following:**\n$$C_{i}\\left(V_{g}-V_{f b}-\\varphi_{s}\\right)={\\sqrt{\\frac{2q\\varepsilon_{s}N_{t}}{{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\sigma}\\int_{0}^{\\varphi_{s}}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}{\\frac{\\exp(-E^{2}/2\\sigma^{2})}{1+\\exp\\left({\\frac{E-E_{f b}-\\varphi_{s}(\\varphi-V)}{k_{B}T}}\\right)}}d E d\\varphi}$$\nwhere F(0) is the electric field perpendicular to the interface at the interface, V **is the channel voltage,**\nand Ef0 **is the Fermi level far from the semiconductor-insulator interface.**\nBy approximating the Fermi–Dirac distribution with the Boltzmann distribution, Equation (28)\ncan be rewritten as:\n$$C_{i}\\Big{(}V_{g}-V_{f b}-\\varphi_{s}\\Big{)}=\\sqrt{\\frac{2q\\varepsilon_{s}N_{t}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma}\\int_{0}^{\\varphi_{s}}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}x p\\Big{(}-\\frac{E^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}-\\frac{E-E_{f0}-q(\\varphi-V)}{k_{B}T}\\Big{)}d E d\\varphi_{s}$$\nSince the localized states mainly lie in the higher energy of Gaussian DOS, E − Ef 0 > 2kBT is usually achieved. As the carrier density varies over a narrow range, then the Fermi–Dirac distribution can be approximated by the Boltzmann distribution. According to Equation (29), the surface potential can be calculated as:\n$$\\left(V_{g}-V_{f b}-\\varphi_{s}\\right)^{2}=k e x p\\left(-{\\frac{V}{\\varphi_{t}}}\\right)\\left(e x p\\left({\\frac{\\varphi_{s}}{\\varphi_{t}}}\\right)-1\\right)$$\nwhere k = ερε k p N exp ( − 0.5 σ 2 ). The solution of Equation (30) actually is numerical. However, under low gate voltage OTFTs operate in weak accumulation mode, that is, φ s  ≪ \nthe surface potential φ sτν is small and can be obtained as\n$$\\phi_{s w}=V_{g}-V_{f b}+{\\frac{k e x p\\left(-{\\frac{V}{\\varphi_{t}}}\\right)}{2\\varphi_{t}}}-{\\sqrt{\\left(V_{g}-V_{f b}+{\\frac{k e x p(-v/\\varphi_{t})}{2\\varphi_{t}}}\\right)^{2}-\\left(V_{g}-V_{f b}\\right)^{2}}}$$\n$\\mathbf{\\hat{z}}_{\\geq0}$\nUnder high gate voltage, OTFTs operate in a strong accumulation mode, that is, V g\n$\\cdot$is $\\ V_2-V_{\\ell\\ell}\\gg$. \nφ f . In this case, the surface potential φ ss reads as\n$$\\phi_{s s}=2\\varphi_{t}l n\\left({\\frac{V_{g}-V_{f b}}{\\sqrt{k}}}\\right)+V$$\nConnecting Equations (31) and (32), the unified surface potential of OTFTs is expressed as\n$$\\varphi_{s}=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\varphi_{sw}\\gamma\\cdot\\varphi_{ss}\\gamma}{\\varphi_{sw}\\gamma+\\varphi_{ss}\\gamma}}\\tag{1}$$\nFigure 11 a shows the comparison between the surface potential calculated using the Boltzmann distribution and Fermi–Dirac distribution functions under different channel voltages, respectively [ 83 ].\nOne can see that a good agreement is observed. Figure 11 b shows the absolute and relative error of the Boltzmann function approximation from Figure 11a, revealing that the maximum of relative error is less than 0.6%, as shown by the maximum peak in Figure 11 b. This approximation displays good accuracy for weak, moderate and strong accumulation at various channel voltages. Otherwise, the absolute error of the surface potential introduced by the Boltzmann function approximation decreases with channel voltage and is always lower than 0.035 V.\n![14_image_0.png](14_image_0.png)\nFor OTFTs, the field-effect mobility can be written as [ 84 ]:\n$$\\mu=\\mu_{0}e x p\\left(C_{1}(2n/N_{t})^{C_{2}}\\right)$$\nhere C 1 and C 2 are given as C 1 = 0.5( S 2 − S ) and C 2 = 2 ln( s 2 − S ) − ln( ln( 4 )) , which only depend on the disorder, n is the carrier concentration, µ 0 = µ 00exp ( − aS − bS 2 ), ˇ S = σ/k B T, and µ 00 is the mobility in the limit n → 0.\nUsing the same method in the literature , the field-effect mobility µ*e f f* **is calculated with**\nµe f f = L CiWVds ∂Ids ∂Vg = √εsε0/2q Ci n(ϕs)µ(n(ϕs)) qR ϕ 0 R ∞ −∞ g(E)dEdϕ × 2Ci qR ϕs 0R ∞ −∞ g(E)dEdϕ √εsqn(ϕs) ≈ µ0expC1(2Ci) 2C2 (2εskBTNt) C2 Vg − Vf b − γVds2C2 (35)\n$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}g(E)\\Big(1+exp\\Big(\\frac{E-E_{f0}-q(\\varphi-V)}{k_BT}\\Big)\\Big)^{-1}dE,\\ \\gamma$ is a pdf duration. \n−1dE, γ **is a parameter that accounts for**\nchannel-length modulation.\nThen, according to Gauss's law, the sheet density of total induced charges in the channel is given\n$$Q_{i}=C_{i}{\\Big(}V_{g}-V_{f b}-\\phi_{s}{\\Big)}\\approx C_{i}{\\sqrt{K}}e x p{\\Big(}{\\frac{(\\varphi_{s}-V)}{2\\varphi_{t}}}-1{\\Big)}$$\nBy differentiating Equation (36) with respect to ϕs**, we then obtain:**\n$${\\frac{d V}{d\\varphi_{s}}}={\\frac{2\\varphi_{t}}{\\sqrt{K}}}e x p\\left(-{\\frac{\\varphi_{s}-V}{2\\varphi_{t}}}+1\\right)+1=2\\varphi_{t}{\\frac{C_{i}}{Q_{i}}}+1$$\nUsing the gradual channel approximation, Ids **is given by:**\n$$I_{d s}=-\\mu_{e f f}W Q_{i}{\\frac{d V}{d y}}=-\\mu_{e f f}W Q_{i}\\bigg(2\\varphi_{t}{\\frac{C_{i}}{Q_{i}}}+1\\bigg){\\frac{d\\varphi}{d y}}$$\nBy integrating Equation (38) from ϕs = ϕss to ϕs = ϕsd**, the static current of OTFTs becomes:**\n$$I_{d\\alpha0}=\\frac{\\mu_{eff}W}{L}\\bigg{(}2\\varphi_{t}C_{i}(\\varphi_{sd}-\\varphi_{ss})-\\frac{C_{i}}{2}\\bigg{(}\\left(V_{g}-V_{fb}-\\varphi_{sd}\\right)^{2}-\\left(V_{g}-V_{fb}-\\varphi_{ss}\\right)^{2}\\bigg{)}\\bigg{)}\\tag{39}$$\nwhere ϕss and ϕsd **are the surface potentials at the source and drain side, respectively. Both of them**\ncan be analytically calculated by Equation (33). When OTFTs are biased to the saturation region, channel-length modulation becomes significant in short channel devices. In this case, the expression of Ids **can be rewritten as:**\nIds = Ids0(1 + λVds) **(40)**\nBased on Equation (40), the OTFT characteristics can be described by a new formula that does not contain the threshold voltage.\ncurrent–voltage characteristics of OTFT. The model agrees well with the experimental results in both the linear and saturation regions .\n![16_image_0.png](16_image_0.png)\nWe also verified our proposed model by comparing it to measurements of OTFTs with channel lengths from 25 µ m to 5 µ m ( W = 1000 µ m), as shown in Figure 13 [ 83 ]. The extracted λ values are 0.55 and 0.27 for L = 5 µ m and L = 10 µ m, respectively.\n![16_image_1.png](16_image_1.png)\n3.4. A -Igzo Tfts\nAs mentioned in Section 2.3 , the MTR theory is responsible for the charge transport of a-IGZO TFTs.\nWe have combined the MTR theory with the surface potential to develop the compact model of IGZO\nTS [ 86 , 87 ]. Generally speaking, in TFTs, due to the accumulated carriers in semiconductor-insulator interface under the gate voltage, the gate-induced potential φ ( x ) shifts the difference between the mobility edge and the Fermi level. The quasi-Fermi level E f ( x ) is\n$$E_{f}(x)=E_{f0}+q\\varphi(x)$$\nThe variation of φ ( x ) with respect to the distance x is determined by the Poisson equation as [ 57 ]:\n$$F(x)^{2}=\\frac{2q}{\\varepsilon_{s}}n_{total}=\\frac{2q}{\\varepsilon_{s}}\\Bigg{[}N_{t}v_{0}v_{0}exp\\bigg{(}\\frac{E_{f}(x)}{k_{B}T}\\bigg{)}+\\int\\limits_{0}^{\\varphi(x)}\\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^{0}\\frac{g(E)}{1+exp\\bigg{(}\\frac{E-E_{f}(x)}{k_{B}T}\\bigg{)}}Ed\\varphi(x)\\Bigg{]}\\tag{42}$$\nwhere F(x) is the electric field perpendicular to the interface. At the interface, the electric field F**(0) can**\nbe expressed through Gauss's law as:\n$$\\varepsilon_{s}F(0)=C_{i}\\Big{(}V_{g}-V_{fb}-\\varphi_{s}\\Big{)}=\\sqrt{2qs_{s}\\Bigg{[}Ntv_{0}v_{0}exp\\Big{(}\\frac{F_{e}(x)}{k_{B}T}\\Big{)}+f_{0}^{\\varphi(x)}\\int_{-\\infty}^{0}\\frac{g(F)}{1+exp\\Big{(}\\frac{F-F(x)}{k_{B}T}\\Big{)}}\\,dEd\\varphi(x)\\Bigg{]}}\\tag{43}$$\nwhere TTA is the characteristic temperature of the exponential DOS, τ0 **is the lifetime of carriers, and** v0 is the attempt-to-escape frequency. Then, the field effect mobility could be written as :\n$$\\mu_{eff}=\\frac{\\mu_{e}}{1+\\left(\\frac{1}{v_{0}v_{0}}\\Gamma(1+T/T_{TA})\\Gamma(1-T/T_{TA})exp\\Big{(}\\frac{E_{fu}+q\\varphi_{s}}{k_{\\rm B}T_{TA}}\\Big{(}\\frac{T}{T_{TA}}-1\\Big{)}\\Big{)}\\right)^{-1}}\\tag{44}$$\nwhere µeis the band mobility and Γ(z) = πz/ sin πz**. Under the low gate voltage, Fermi level lies**\nin the deep states and hence free carriers above the mobility edge can be neglected, and carriers of localized states will dominate the transport of IGZO TFTs (corresponding to the sub-threshold regime of transistor). Thus, the total carrier concentration is reasonably written as\n$$n(x)\\approx\\int_{-\\infty}^{0}{\\frac{g(E,x)}{1+e x p\\left({\\frac{E-E_{f}(x)}{k_{B}T}}\\right)}}d E=N_{t}\\Gamma\\left(1+{\\frac{T}{T r_{A}}}\\right)\\Gamma\\left(1-{\\frac{T}{T r_{A}}}\\right)e x p\\left({\\frac{E_{f0}+q\\varphi_{s}}{k_{B}T r_{A}}}\\right)$$\nSubstituting Equations (45) into (43), one can get the following expression:\n$$F_{i}\\left(V_{g}-V_{f b}-\\varphi_{s}\\right)=\\sqrt{q\\varepsilon_{s}\\left[N_{t}v_{0}v_{0}e x p\\left({\\frac{E_{f}(x)}{k_{B}T}}\\right)+N_{t}\\Gamma\\left(1+{\\frac{T}{T_{T A}}}\\right)\\Gamma\\left(1-{\\frac{T}{T_{T A}}}\\right)e x p\\left({\\frac{E_{f}+q\\varphi_{s}}{k_{B}T_{T A}}}\\right)\\right]}$$\nTo achieve the analytic solution of the surface potential, we transformed Equation (46) as:\n$$V_{g}-V_{f b}-\\varphi_{s}=G_{T}e x p\\left(\\frac{q\\varphi_{s}-q V_{c h}}{2k_{B}T}\\right)+G_{T A}e x p\\left(\\frac{q\\varphi_{s}-q V_{c h}}{2k_{B}T_{T A}}\\right)$$\n2kBTTA **(47)**\nGT and GTA **can be expressed as:**\n$$\\begin{array}{l}{{G_{T}=\\frac{1}{C_{i}}\\sqrt{q\\varepsilon_{s}v_{0}\\tau_{0}N_{t}e x p\\left(\\frac{E_{f0}}{k_{B}T}\\right)}}}\\\\ {{G_{T A}=\\frac{1}{C_{i}}\\sqrt{q\\varepsilon_{s}N_{t}\\Gamma\\left(1+\\frac{T}{T_{T A}}\\right)\\Gamma\\left(1-\\frac{T}{T_{T A}}\\right)e x p\\left(\\frac{E_{f0}}{k_{B}T_{T A}}\\right)}}}\\end{array}$$\nThrough estimating the order of magnitudes, in Equation (47) the first term is much smaller than the second term. Thus, we only consider the second term and ignore the first term. By using two-order Taylor expansion, one can get:\n$$x_{i}=x g\\left\\{\\left[(x g+1)^{2}+2x n+2l o g\\left({\\frac{x g}{G_{T}}}\\right)\\right]^{1/2}-x g-1\\right\\}$$\nHowever, if one considers only the second term in Equation (47), some errors in the surface potential calculation maybe occur. In order to improve the accuracy, we add some corrections by using the Schroder series method to cover the influence of the first term in Equation (47). Finally, the analytical solution of the surface potential can be written as:\n$$\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{{\\varphi_{s}=2{\\frac{k_{B}T_{T A}}{q}}\\left[x_{i}-{\\frac{f}{g f}}\\left(1+{\\frac{\\partial^{2}f}{2\\partial f}}{\\frac{f}{\\partial f}}\\right)\\right]}}\\\\ {{f=(x g-x)-G_{T A}e x p(x-x n)-G_{T}(e x p(x-x n))^{\\frac{T_{T A}}{1}}}}\\end{array}\\right.$$\n$\\ensuremath{\\mathcal{C}}$\nFigure 14 shows a comparison of calculated surface potential between analytic solution and numerical result [ 86 , 87 ]. The percentage error between the numerical and analytical solutions is always below 0.2%. The parameters are T = 300 K, T TA = 405 K, voto = 1, V p = 0.5 V, C i = 8.85 × 10 − 8 F/cm²,\nand μ ε = 19.7 cm 2 /Vs.\n![18_image_0.png](18_image_0.png)\nUsing the gradual channel approximation, the current equation is given as:\n$$I_{d s}=-\\mu_{e f f}W Q_{i}{\\frac{d V}{d y}}=-\\mu_{e f f}W Q_{i}\\left(2\\varphi_{t}{\\frac{C_{i}}{Q_{i}}}+1\\right){\\frac{d\\varphi}{d y}}$$\nBy integrating Equation (51) from φ s = φ ss to φ s\n= φ sd , the static current of a-IGZO TFTs is expressed as:\n$$I_{ds0}=\\mu_{eff}\\frac{W}{L}\\bigg{[}2\\varphi_{l}C_{i}(\\varphi_{sd}-\\varphi_{ss})-\\frac{1}{2}\\bigg{(}\\left(V_{g}-V_{fb}-\\varphi_{sd}\\right)^{2}-\\left(V_{g}-V_{fb}-\\varphi_{ss}\\right)^{2}\\bigg{)}\\bigg{]}\\tag{52}$$\nwhere φ ss and φ sd are the surface potential at source and drain side, respectively. Both of them can be analytically calculated from Equation (50).\nFigure 15 shows the output and transfer characteristics curve. The good agreement between our modeling results and the experimental data has been observed [ 86 , 87 ]. Figure 16 shows the drain conductance and trans-conductance curves [ 86 , 87 ]. Our model well agrees with the measured results.\n![18_image_1.png](18_image_1.png)\n![19_image_0.png](19_image_0.png)\n4. Comparison Of Various Compact Models\nAs mentioned above, the most difference between silicon-based TFTs and TFTs with new active material (e.g., OTFTs and IGZO TFTs) derived from the fact that whether the threshold voltage can be defined in TFT device.  Since OTFTs and IGZO TFIs usually operate in accumulation region, the formulation of compact model should discard the influence of the threshold voltage. The following will give a comparison for different compact models.\n4.1. Comparison Of Model Accuracy\nFor the compact models, the central aim is to accurately and physically describe the current–voltage characteristics of TFTs.  Here, we will discuss various compact models and their accuracies verified for TFTs. For polysilicon TFTs, we firstly compare V ds − I ds characteristics based on the surface-potential-based by Chen et al. [ 72 ] and the EMA method by Iñiguez et al. [ 28 ], respectively, as shown in Figure 17 .  It is obvious that the surface-potential-based model agrees well with experimental data. However, the simulated results from Iñiguez et al. show a well consistent between model and experiment under low drain voltage, with increasing the drain voltage, the model seriously deviated from the experiment. Similar errors of model accuracy have also been found in the OTFT compact models. Figure 18 shows a comparison of V ds − I ds characteristics based on the surface potential and the generic model, respectively [ 24 , 83 ]. For the surface-potential-based model in Figure 18 a, the accuracy is good in all regions, but for the generic model in Figure 18 b the errors increase with the gate voltage increasing.\n![19_image_1.png](19_image_1.png)\n![20_image_0.png](20_image_0.png)\nStrictly speaking, the errors derive from the transformation from the numerical equation to the analytical solution. To obtain analytical solution, the authors usually transferred the numerical model to analytical expression by using some reasonable assumption. Intuitively, various assumptions will generate different error values, which finally affect the model accuracy. Thus, the analysis of the error is essential to transfer the numerical equation to the analytical expression. For the surface-potential-based compact models, reducing the errors of the calculated surface potential has become an important criterion. However, as compared with surface-potential-based models, the errors for the charge-based models are always ignored, which thus results in the lower accuracy.\n4.2. Parameter Comparison And Extraction\nApart from the accuracy and comprehensive nature, an excellent compact model should include as few parameters as possible fitting the TFT characteristics. Tables 1 and 2 **give a summary of the**\nparameter comparison for the surface-potential-based compact models and OTFT compact models based on different approaches, respectively. It is found that the researchers always aspired for as few parameter numbers as possible during developing compact models. Actually, for the compact model, the fewer the non-physical parameters (fitting parameters), the better the model is considered. From Tables 1 and **2, one can see that the parameter numbers in our model is just 12, which is superior,** compared with other models.\n| Types            | Parameter Numbers   | Authors                   | Years   |\n|------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|---------|\n| 15           | Y.

Generally speaking, parameter extraction aims at being physical. To achieve higher level, the parameter sequence should introduce physical effect .\nHowever, considering the continuity and accuracy of compact model, the fitting parameters will be used for smoothing the output curves and reducing the error. It is anticipated that the compact models of TFTs with the parameter setting will be suitable to circuit design and can provide accurate insight into the performance. The main criterion for a good set of parameters is the balance of error, efficiency and continuity. For IGZO TFTs, we have developed an extraction flow of the key physical parameters of the surface-potential-based compact model, as shown in Figure 19 **. Based on the corresponding**\nequations shown in Figure **19, four key parameters can be extracted, that is, the maximum mobility** µ0, the characteristic temperature TTA, the product of the escape frequency v0 **and carrier lifetime** τ0.\nA compact model must satisfy several rather restrictive requirements imposed by their use in advanced circuit simulators. From the mathematical point of view, the equations of the models should meet three classes at least , that is, \"class 1\" in order to be compatible with Newton–Raphson-based circuit simulators, with \"class 2\" or better preferred in order to achieve faster convergence, and\n\"class 3\" required for circuit simulation of active-matrix organic light-emitting diode (AMOLED)\ndisplays or distortion modeling in RF circuits. Currently, the most compact models are satisfied to the\n\"class 1\". A small numbers of compact models can meet the requirements of \"class 2\" and \"class 3\" together. For the \"class 3\" requirement, the application is completely based on the active layers of TFTs.\nFor example, silicon-based TFTs (poly-Si and a-Si:H) are mainly used in AMOLED displays. OTFTs can\n![22_image_0.png](22_image_0.png)\nbe applied to logic circuit design and flat-panel display. IGZO TFTs can be used in constructing RFID tags or inverter. Thus, the compact model of TFTs should be established according to their application.\nIn addition, it would be specially mentioned that, in order to meet the requirement of \"class 2\", the compact model must fulfill one of the benchmark tests, i.e., Gummel symmetry test (GST) . Based on our surface-potential-based compact model for IGZO TFTs, the GST has been provided ,\nas shown in Figure 20. Figure **20a shows a GST circuit for IGZO TFTs. Generally, the higher-order**\nderivatives in TFT compact models are obtained as a function of Vx**, which is symmetry for** Vx = 0.\nThis symmetry roots in the symmetry device structure and channel. Figure **20b shows the GST for**\nthe 1, 2, 3-order derivative of the drain current of IGZO TFTs, which display a good continuity and symmetry. Thus, our compact model in IGZO TFTs can pass the GST.\n5. Conclusions And Outlook\nCompact models form a critical link between the manufacturing teams and the chip design teams by mathematically capturing the properties of devices. We have reviewed the concept, development and application of compact model of TFTs. Based on different active materials in TFTs, the charge transport characteristics has also been discussed in detail. Based on the different approaches, especially the surface-potential-based, the merits and shortcomings for current compact models have discussed.\nWe also proposed our surface-potential-based compact models for organic and IGZO TFTs and parameter extraction technology. The comparison of various compact models has been summarized.\nCurrently, the compact model is still open and evolving. To achieve the excellent compact model, the following should be considered: accurate in all regions of operation and types, suitable for all simulation modes, excellent convergence, and intuitive and easy to extract parameters. In addition, to keep pace with the increase of circuit operating frequencies and device tolerances scale down, the compact model of TFTs should account for the bias dependent contact resistances, gate tunneling, interface effect and scaling effect. The dynamic behavior, aging and hysteresis of TFTs also should be considered in developing the compact model to pursue the future circuit design.\nAuthor Contributions: **N.L. and L.L. conceived the idea and designed this work; N.L. drafted the paper; N.L.,**\nand L.L. discussed the results and commented on the manuscript; all authors have given approval to the final version of the manuscript.\nAcknowledgments: **This work was supported in part by National key research and development program**\nConflicts of Interest: The authors declare no conflict of interest."

        "text": "High-Performance Vacuum-Processed Metal Oxide Thin-Film Transistors: A Review Of Recent Developments\nSince 2010, vacuum-processed oxide semiconductors have greatly improved with the publication of more than 1,300 related papers. Although the number of researches on oxide semiconductors has continued to increase year by year, the average field-effect mobility of oxide semiconductor thin-film transistors (TFTs) has not shown significant improvement; from 2010 to 2018; the average field-effect mobility of vacuum-processed n-type oxide TFTs is around 20 cm2/\nVs. To investigate the obstacles for performance improvements, the latest progress and researches on vacuum-processed oxide semiconductor TFTs for high performance over the past decade are highlighted, along with the pros and cons of each technology. Finally, complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) logic circuits composed of both n- and p-type oxide semiconductor TFTs are introduced, and future prospects for this state-of-the-art research on the oxide semiconductors are presented.\nKEYWORDS oxide thin-film transistors, vacuum process\nSince thin-film transistors (TFTs) based on amorphous indium gallium zinc oxide (a-IGZO) were announced by Hosono et al.1 amorphous oxide semiconductor TFTs have attracted a lot of interest due to their exceptional properties such as relatively high field-effect mobility\n(~10 cm2/Vs), low off-state current (~pA), high uniformity over a large area (up to Gen. 10.5), and high transmittance (~90%) for visible light.2,3 These advantages have led to a quantum leap in the technology, and their commercialization in 2012 as a driving circuit unit for liquid crystal displays (LCDs) used for monitors, tablets, and mobile phones. Since 2013, they have also been used in high-resolution organic light-emitting diode (OLED)\npanels, making them successful in the display market.4,5 However, as the resolution and frame-rate of display devices have gradually increased, further improvement in the field-effect mobility has recently been required. For instance, for Super Hi-Vision (8 × 4 K) and high framerate (>240 Hz) displays, the field-effect mobility of oxide TFTs should be improved much higher (>30 cm2/Vs).6 For this reason, the recent progress toward highperformance vacuum-processed oxide TFTs is summarized here, focusing on innovative and original studies on each technology. First, in Section 2, the recent achievements in the field-effect mobility of n-type oxide TFTs will be examined in detail considering the aspects of material, process, and structural engineering, and discussing the most promising and competitive technologies.\nHee Jun Kim and Kyungho Park contributed equally. In Section 3, recent researches on p-type oxide TFTs are J Soc Inf Display. 2020;28:591–622. wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/jsid © 2020 Society for Information Display. 591 introduced, focusing on three of the most promising candidates (tin oxide, copper oxide, and nickel oxide). The last topic of this review is dedicated to complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) devices, consisting of n- and p-type oxide TFTs. This review ends with a description of the outlook and prospects for future research directions on oxide technologies.\n2 | N-Type Oxide Semiconductor-Based Tfts\nFigure 1 shows the number of vacuum-processed n-type oxide TFT papers published from 2010 to 2018 based on Web of Science searches. Since 2011, the number of published papers has increased rapidly, and more than 100 papers have been published every year, showing continuing interest. We examined the field-effect mobilities reported by papers on vacuum-processed n-type oxide TFT published in journals within the top 25% (Q1) in Journal Citation Reports (JCR). Among these papers, while the number of studies has increased, there was not a significant change in the average field-effect mobility over the last decade with an average value of ~20 cm2/Vs\n(to calculate the average mobility as objectively as possible, the field-effect mobilities were extracted from the papers only published from the journals within the top 25% (Q1) in JCR rather than including a large number of papers having ultra-high mobility over 100 cm2/Vs). In the following sections, to identify what we need to\ndevelop the field-effect mobility of n-type oxide TFTs, the latest researches on high-performance vacuum-processed n-type oxide TFTs, that correspond to the journals within the top 25% (Q1) in JCR and show the field-effect mobility over 20 cm2/Vs, are examined with three different engineering approaches: material, process, and structure.\n2.1 | Material Engineering 2.1.1 | Oxygen Vacancy Modulation\n592 KIM ET AL.\nIn general, oxygen vacancies (VO) in the metal-oxide matrix are considered donors generating carriers in ntype oxide semiconductors. Thus, by controlling VO in the metal-oxide bulk, the electrical performances of oxide TFTs could be enhanced.303 Various studies, which control the VO and carrier concentration in the metal oxide channel layer through sputter parameters such as working pressure, reactive gas, and gas flow ratio, have been reported to improve the field-effect mobility of n-type oxide TFTs.\nRecently, Han et al. reported on tin-doped zinc oxide\n(TZO) TFTs sputter-deposited with various O2 flow ratios.235 During TZO channel deposition through radiofrequency magnetron sputtering, the oxygen partial pressure (OPP) was modulated from 0 to 30% to investigate the effects of OPP on the electrical characteristics of TZO TFTs. Figure 2A shows the transfer characteristics of TZO TFTs with various values of OPP. At an OPP of 0%,\nthe TZO TFTs included many VO, which result in weakened gate control and poor transfer characteristics. With increasing OPP, the electrical characteristics of devices improve as VO decreases, allowing for stable gate control.\nParticularly, TZO TFTs with an OPP of 10% have the best electrical performance, with a low off-current of 3 pA, a high current on/off ratio of 2 × 107, a low subthreshold swing (S.S) of 333 mV/dec, and a high field-effect mobility of 66.7 cm2/Vs, respectively. Besides the electrical characteristics of devices according to OPP, the atomic force microscopy (AFM) surface morphology of TZO was also examined as shown in Figure 2B. The root-meansquare (RMS) values of roughness were 1.1 nm\n(OPP = 0%), 0.52 nm (OPP = 10%), 0.45 nm (OPP = 20%), and 0.56 nm (OPP = 30%), respectively, which mean that TZO films with OPP of 10% or more have more compact and smoother surfaces than those without OPP. These results confirm that the role of O2 during the deposition process is the key parameter for high mobility TZO TFTs.\nIn addition to modulation of O2 concentration in a single metal-oxide layer, gradual modulation of O2 concentration in the vertical direction has been implemented in vacuum-processed n-type oxide TFTs.

First, 30-nm-thick IZO bottom layers were deposited in an ambient mix of Ar and O 2 , with various O 2 flow ratios. Next, when upper IZO layers were deposited, O 2 gas injection was stopped, and thus 30-nm-thick IZO top layers had gradually reduced O 2 concentration in the vertical direction. The fabricated IZO layers deposited in gradient O 2 ambient were used as the channel and source/drain (S/D) electrodes without further S/D electrodes. Figure 2D shows the transfer characteristics of junctionless IZO TFTs with different O 2 flow ratios during bottom IZO deposition (device A: 30 nm IZO deposited at 0% O 2 /30 nm IZO deposited at 4% O 2 , device B:\n(seath) online and but sumar, our and \"[1702 10/21] no varadill online volitis , dilent view 30 nm IZO deposited at 0% O2/30 nm IZO deposited at 7% O2, and device C: 30 nm IZO deposited at 0% O2). As O2 flow ratio increased during the deposition of bottom IZO layers from 0 to 7%, threshold voltage (Vth) also increased from −0.78 to 0.30 V, as a result of changes in electron concentration within the IZO channel layer.\nWith 4% O2 flow (device A), IZO TFTs show superior electrical characteristics with a low S. S of 0.13 V/dec, high current on/off ratio >106, and high field-effect mobility of 65.8 cm2/Vs, respectively. These results indicate that when O concentration in IZO film was modulated vertically, the carrier concentration in IZO film could be effectively controlled, which enabled highperformance oxide TFTs as well as a simple device structure through junctionless TFTs without S/D electrodes.\nBesides modulation of O2 concentration during the depositioon of oxide channel layer, the post-annealing in O2 ambient is also effective way to control the VO concentration of oxide channel layer. Zhang et al. investigated the effects of post-annealing in O2 ambient on the electrical characteristics of ZnO films.163 Figure 2E shows the transfer characteristics of ZnO TFTs with various post-annealing temperatures in O2 ambient. ZnO TFTs wthout post-annealing showed high conductivity without distinct on/off switching. However, the proper switching characteristics began to appear from the annealing temperature of 300C in O2 ambient as the VO decreased.\nUnder 400C annealing treatment in O2 ambient, ZnO\nTFTs showed the best peroformances, such as a fieldeffect mobility of 21.3 cm2/Vs, a current on/off ratio of 107, and S. S of 0.39 V/dec. However, when annealing temperature increased from 400C to 500C, the fieldeffect mobility decreased due to the diffusion of Zn ions to Al2O3 layer. Figure 2F shows Zn and Al distribution of ZnO/Al2O3 stack measured by glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy (GDOES). As annealing temperature increased, the amount of diffused Zn ions increased, then ZnAlOx structure formed by extra thermal energy at 500C. The ZnAlOx could introduce interface traps and leakage paths in Al2O3 gate insulator. As a result, with 500C annealing treatment, the off-current increased from ~10−12 to 10−8 A, and field-effect mobility decreased from 21.3 to 13.4 cm2/Vs.\nOne of the most investigated metal oxide materials as both conductor or semiconductor is indium oxide (In2O3)\nbecause extensive overlap between 5 s orbitals leads to high electron mobility. To achieve optimized conductive or semiconductive transport characteristics in In2O3, doping the In2O3 with at least one secondary ion is the 594 KIM ET AL.\nrepresentative method. For instance, Sn doped In2O3\n(ITO) are widely used as a transparent conductor by high carrier concentration as a result of difference in oxidation state between In3+ and Sn4+.\n304 When Ga and/or Zn are doped into In2O3 (indium gallium oxide [IGO], IZO, and IGZO), doped metals make In2O3 have appropriate semiconductor properties while pure In2O3 TFTs are usually difficult to control off-current and Vth due to high carrier concentration of In2O3. In IGZO, Ga serves as a carrier suppressor because Ga strongly bonds with O, and Zn stabilize the amorphous state.305,306 Besides above materials, doping other materials has widely been attempted to contol the electrical characteristics of oxide semiconductor. In metal oxide semiconductors, it is well known that energy bandgap, standard electrode potential (SEP),\nand electronegativity are key parameters for selecting dopants.307 In terms of the energy bandgap of metal oxide semiconductors, larger bandgap materials act as carrier suppressors because it can move the donor-related states toward the deep level states. In the case of the SEP, it indicates the degree of metal oxidation, so atoms with lower SEP act as effective carrier suppressors in a metal oxide matrix. In addition to SEP and bandgap, electronegativity is also an important factor for the degree of carrier suppressors. As the difference in electronegativity between the metal and O atoms increase, the number of VO decreases. Therefore, metal atoms with larger bandgap, lower SEP, and lower electronegativity than the host materials in the metal-oxide matrix can be appropriate candidates as carrier suppressors. Examples include magnesium (Mg), strontium (Sr), yttrium (Y), zirconium\n(Zr), barium (Ba), and hafnium (Hf ).308–312 Recently, Peng et al. demonstrated neodymiumsubstituted indium oxide (InNdO) TFTs to improve electrical characteristics. In2O3 is one of promising high mobility metal oxide semiconductors because the carrier mobility of a single crystal of indium oxide can be up to 160 cm2/Vs.313 However, In2O3 TFTs usually have excessive carrier concentrations with negative Vth, which means it is not appropriate for practical applications. Thus, in this study, neodymium (Nd) is adopted as a dopant to control carrier concentration and VO,\nbecasue Nd has a high bonding strength with O\n(703 kJ/mol) and low electronegativity (Nd = 1.1).314 As shown in Figure 3A and B, the line scan profile and element distribution map of Nd extracted from energy-dispersion X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) show that no Nd2O3 clusters are formed in the InNdO films, which means that the Nd atoms have a relatively good solid solubility in In2O3.\n197 Figure 3C shows the transfer characteristics of InNdO\nTFTs annealing at 300C and 450C. InNdO TFTs annealed at either temperature showed proper n-type vxl ' 2 ' 0 00 ' 1918 w 2019/11/11/11/11/11/11/11/11/11/11/11/111/11 anO backmay, on ang \"[1702 10/61] no caradic] onlinO coliW stimuli vis\nswitching characteristics with a large current on/off ratio.\nParticularly, when annealed at 450°C, the field-effect mobility increased from 7.7 to 20.4 cm 2 /Vs due to better crystallinity and larger grain size. Furthermore, they showed improved electrical stability under positive gate bias stress (PBS). When a drain-bias (V DS ) of 5 V and a gate-bias ( V GS ) of 10 V are applied for 150 min, the turnon voltages of InNdO TFTs annealed at 300°C and 450°C\nshifted by 4.4 V and 0.5 V, respectively.\nBesides parameters for dopants such as SEP, energy bandgap, and electronegativity, indicating bonding strength and dissociation energy between the dopant and O, Lewis acid strength is also a key factor. According to Wen et al., dopants with high Lewis acid strength polarize electronic charge strongly from the O 2p valence band, thus screening the electronic charge and weakening its activity as a scattering center. 315 As the carbon\n(C) atoms have a high Lewis acid strength as well as high bonding strength between C and O, Kwon et al. demonstrated oxide TFTs using carbon indium zinc oxide\n(CIZO) as a channel layer to improve field-effect mobility. 169 Figure 3D shows the transfer curves of IZO TFTs annealed at 250°C with and without incorporated carbon.\nIZO TFTs without carbon have deteriorated The switching characteristics and their S/D contacts breakdown when a high gate bias is applied. However, CIZO\nTFTs exhibited superior electrical characteristics, such as a field-effect mobility of 32.3 cm2/Vs, S. S of 0.55 V/dec, and current on/off ratio of 6.2 × 107. CIZO TFTs have good stability also as shown in Figure 3E. After PBS test under a VGS of 20 V for 12,600 s, the turn-on voltage of CIZO TFT shifted slightly to 2.7 V.\nFurthermore, in 2017, a new doping approach was developed that simultaneously improves the electrical characteristics and stability of IGZO TFTs via diffusion of passivation layer (PVL) material. Kim et al. proposed nitrocellulose (NC) as a new PVL material257; it was previously used for billiard balls and dynamite and has recently been used as a substrate for protein chips.316 In that study, NC was deposited on IGZO film as a PVL\nlayer using a solution process at a low annealing temperature of 120C. Figure 3F shows the transfer characteristics of IGZO TFTs without and with NC PVLs. IGZO\nTFTs with NC PVLs have improved electrical characteristics, such as field-effect mobility from 11.72 to 20.68 cm2/\nVs and current on/off ratio from 5.31 × 107 to 4.79 × 108.\nPBS stability is also improved with NC PVLs. IGZO TFTs were tested without any PVLs, with poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) PVLs, and with NC PVLs; under PBS\ntests (VGS = 20 V, VDS = 10.1 V, time = 10,000 s), the Vth shifts were 5.08, 3.94, and 2.35 V, respectively. The improvements in electrical characteristics and stability are due to the nitrogen (N) diffusion and barrier effects of NC PVLs, as shown in Figure 3G. In the case of the N diffusion effect, N atoms from NC PVLs can reduce weak M–O bonds and O-related defects near the back of the channel layer. In addition, the diffused N increases the concentration of VO in the front region of the channel layer by attracting O atoms that were weakly bonded to metal atoms. As a result, the decreased O-related defects in the back region of the channel layer reduce off-current, and the increased VO in the front region of the channel layer induced higher field-effect mobility compared to IGZO TFTs without PVLs. For the barrier effect, NC PVLs effectively prevent adsorption of O2 and moisture from air, improving stability.\n2.2 | Process Engineering 2.2.1 | Plasma Treatment\nPreviously, a number of studies have attempted to improve the electrical performance of zinc oxide (ZnO) TFTs by fluorination such as thermal oxidation of zinc fluoride (ZnF2),317 the reactive sputter deposition of Zn in a tetrafluoromethane (CF4) plasma,318 and sputter deposition of ZnF2.\n319 Compared with the aforementioned processes and materials, because ion implantation 596 KIM ET AL.\ncan precisely control the amount of F in metal-oxide films, it was introduced to ZnO films to improve their electrical characteristics (the field-effect mobility of fluorinated ZnO TFT is ~60 cm2/Vs).96 Recently, Lai et al.\nwere the first to investigate the effects of fluorination via plasma treatment on the electrical characteristics of IGZO TFTs.173 CHF3/O2 plasma treatment was conducted on the sample after deposition of IGZO channel layer. The transfer characteristics of TFTs with and without CHF3/O2 plasma treatment are shown in Figure 4A.\nCompared with those without (field-effect mobility = 29.6 cm2/Vs), the plasma-treated devices exhibited a higher field-effect mobility of 39.8 cm2/Vs. In general, F\nand O have similar ionic radii, and Zn bonds more stably with F than with O. Thus, the substitution of O atoms by F within IGZO films easily occurs during plasma treatment. Furthermore, when F atoms substitute for O, a free electron can be generated as a result of the difference in electrovalency between fluorine ions (F−) and oxygen ions (O2−), and these free electrons could improve the mobility of fluorinated IGZO TFTs. In addition to improvements in field-effect mobility, CHF3/O2 plasma treatment could reduce the donor-like states at the channel/gate insulator interfaces by the passivation effect. Consequently, the hysteresis-voltage shift of plasma-treated IGZO TFTs decreased from −1.3 to\n−0.5 V as shown in Figure 4B.\nIn addition to F plasma treatment, there have been numerous attempts to improve the electrical characteristics of IGZO TFTs by introducing hydrogen (H) plasma treatment, as H can act as a shallow donor in oxide semiconductor films.320,321 However, as H doping can lead to a large negative shift of Vth and undesirable photo-instability, Liao et al. recently investigated the effects of H and N co-plasma treatment on IGZO TFTs to simultaneously improve their electrical properties and stability.264 Figure 4C shows the transfer characteristics of TFTs with different H plasma treatment times. As H plasma time increased, off-current significantly increased and the TFTs became conductive due to increased carrier concentration. However, when N was incorporated with H, the TFTs exhibited the typical n-type enhancement mode, as shown in Figure 4D. Because N in the oxide semiconductor can act as an acceptor as well as a defect binder, thus the electrical characteristics of N/H plasma-treated IGZO\nTFTs improved while maintaining low off-current. Particularly, with N/H plasma treatment for 200 s, the fieldeffect mobility is increased from 15.5 to 45.3 cm2/Vs compared to without treatment (when N/H plasma treatment time was over 200 s, device performance is degraded due to carrier scattering from heavy N/H doping). Furthermore, stability is also improved by N/H plasma treatment for 200 s, as shown in Figure 4E. PBS and negative bias\nstress (NBS) tests were conducted under a V GS of ±20 V\nfor 3,600 s. After PBS test, pristine IGZO TFTs showed a large positive V th shift of 9.7 V and IGZO TFT with N/H\nplasma treatment showed a smaller V th shift of 1.8 V.\nWith NBS test for TFTs, without plasma treatment exhibited a large negative V th shift of −9.2 V, and those with N/H plasma treatment showed a smaller negative V th shift of −1.6 V. These results indicate that when oxide semiconductor devices are exposed to N and H plasmas with appropriate treatment times, both the electrical performance and stability can be improved simultaneously by the passivation of many defects, such as V O , in the oxide semiconductor films.\n2.2.2 Laser Annealing -\nConventionally, when IGZO films are deposited by sputtering, the high energy of the target ions and incorporation of Ar ions during deposition can induce ionized Vo, scattering centers, and weakly bonded M–O, thus an activation process with a relatively high temperature of about 300°C is required to fabricate operative IGZO\nTFTs. 322 To solve this limitation, various methods have been investigated to lower the annealing temperature using other energy sources such as ultraviolet light, 323,324 or high-pressure annealing. 213 microwave, 325 While these studies have shown the possibility of lowtemperature activation of IGZO films, the reported field-effect mobilities were less than 16  cm 2 /Vs. As an excimer laser annealing (ELA) process has been widely used to fabricate polycrystalline Si at low temperature, Nakata et al. (2009) and Uraoka et al. (2013) reported the fabrication of IGZO TFTs using XeCl ELA (wavelength = 308 nm), but the reported field-effect mobilstill need further improvement (14.0 ities and 21.7 cm 2 /Vs, respectively). 326,327 Recently, it has been demonstrated that the fieldeffect mobility of IGZO TFTs can dramatically be improved using KrF ELA (wavelength = 248 nm). 263 Figure 5A shows fabricated IGZO TFTs passivated with polysilsesquioxane (PSQ). After irradiation with a single shot of KrF ELA, IGZO TFTs with platinum (Pt)/\nmolybdenum (Mo) and gold (Au)/Mo electrodes exhibited field-effect mobilities of 18.0 and 43.5 cm 2 / Vs, respectively. To investigate the reason that perforimproved, passivation/channel mance the and J 2018bd 44988PP%C001.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.\nsuno ], or .

Comparing the passivated samples subjected to furnace annealing or krypton fluoride (KrF) laser (wavelength = 248 nm) (KrF\nELA), and an unpassivated device via secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS), passivated devices have higher H\nintensity in the IGZO channel region than unpassivated devices as shown in Figure 5B. As described in Section 2.2.1, H can act as a donor in the oxide semiconductor, thus H diffused from the PSQ PVL during the ELA process could increase the field-effect mobility of IGZO TFTs. In the case of electrode/channel interface, it was confirmed by EDS profiles, as shown in Figure 5C.\nFrom these results, it was found that a considerable amount of Au was diffused into the Mo and IGZO layers.\nIt has been reported that diffused Au atoms in the IGZO\nchannel layer reduce the bandgap, thus the conduction band minimum moves to closer to the Fermi level. Consequently, the field-effect mobility of IGZO TFTs with Au/Mo electrodes increased because the carrier concentration in the channel layer was increased by diffused Au atoms.\nMicrowave Annealing 2.2.3\nPreviously, Shieh et al. (2013) and Cho et al. (2014) reported the fabrication of IGZO TFTs by microwave annealing (MWA) as an alternative to thermal annealing (TA). 325,328 Based on these papers, microwave annealed TFTs showed improved performances at low process temperatures, compared with films annealed by a conventional thermal process, because of its advantages such as low thermal budget, rapid heating, thermal uniformity, and suppression of unexpected diffusion. However, the field-effect mobilities reported were less than 10 cm 2 /Vs. Recently, there was an attempt to apply MWA to the fabrication of tin dioxide (SnO 2 ) TFTs, considering that SnO 2 is expected to have a high field-effect mobility due to its high carrier density. 203 As shown in Figure 5D\ncompared to TA, MWA-processed SnO 2 And TFTs showed improved electrical performance resulting from an increase in crystallinity and decrease in defects.\n2.3 Structure Engineering Heterojunction Structure 2.3.1 L\nIn this section, we discuss heterojunction-based oxide TFTs for enhancing mobility characteristics. The use of such TFTs stacked with two or more oxide semiconductor layers takes advantage of the different electrical characteristics of each layer in the stack. As the front channel is the major carrier transport path during operation, the presence of a conductive oxide channel layer in the front channel region results in high field-effect mobility for This idea has recently these devices. 329,330 ben investigated by several research groups to improve the field-effect mobility of oxide TFTs.\nCho et al. reported high mobility oxide TFTs by controlling the thickness of the front IZO channel of aluminum-doped tin zinc indium oxide (ATZIO)/IZO\nbilayer TFTs (Figure 6A). 233 Figure 6B shows the transfer characteristics of such TFTs for different IZO\nthicknesses (e.g., 0, 4, and 8 nm). As the thickness of the conductive front IZO increased, the on-current increased and the turn-on voltage shifted negatively, as a result of enhanced carrier transport in the front channel region. With optimal IZO thickness (8 nm)\nand post-annealing temperature\nJ 2018bd 44.988 PP%2001.01.01.199 m ), odi 208. [1:202 10/21] no varadid online coliW shipsH v 600 KIM ET AL.\nATZIO/IZO TFTs showed their electrical performance, such as a field-effect mobility of 60.4 cm2/Vs and a current on/off ratio of 5 × 109. When investigating the chemical composition of the front IZO channel by EDS depth profiles, it was confirmed that Sn in the back ATZIO channel diffused into the front IZO channel during the post-annealing process, as shown in Figure 6C. It has previously been reported that Sn can act as a mobility enhancer in indium zinc tin oxide\n(IZTO) TFTs.331 Consequently, the electrical characteristics of ATZIO/IZO TFTs could be improved by using a conductive front IZO channel as well as diffused Sn from the back channel.\nRecently, Huang et al. improved the electrical characteristics of oxide TFTs using titanium-doped IGZO\n(IGZO:Ti)/IGZO heterojunction TFTs (Figure 6D).175 Ti atoms tend to getter O atoms due to the high bond enthalpy of Ti-O (672 kJ/mol).332,333 For this reason, the use of IGZO:Ti layer as the back channel layer induces two advantages in IGZO:Ti/IGZO heterojunction TFTs: i) high field-effect mobility by inducing VO in the front channel region, ii) low leakage current through the role of passivation. As shown in Figure 6E and F, TFT performance was optimized by modulating the thickness (e.g., 10, 15, 20 nm) of the front channel. With optimal thickness of the front IGZO channel (10 nm), IGZO:Ti/IGZO heterojunction TFTs showed electrical characteristics with a fieldeffect mobility of 63 cm2/Vs, as a result of Ti incorporation.\nFurther improvement of field-effect mobility in heterojunction-based oxide TFTs was reported by Hwang et al.176 In that research, indium tin oxide\n(ITO), commonly used as a transparent conducting oxide (TCO), was inserted between the oxide channel and the gate insulator, as shown in Figure 6G. When investigating the effects of ITO thickness, 2-nm-thick ITO-inserted TFTs showed decreased electrical properties because of a degraded channel/gate insulator interface and insufficient conductivity for transferring electrons. On the other hand, in the case of the 9- and 15-nm-thick ITO layers, the off-current of the IGZO/ITO TFT devices dramatically increased due to the excessive conductivity of thick ITO layers, as shown in Figure 6H. For the optimal thickness of ITO layer (5 nm), the saturation mobility was increased from ~10 to ~80 cm2/Vs compared to conventional IGZO TFTs. As described above, the use of heterojunction-structured oxide TFTs with two different oxide materials improves the field-effect mobility of devices. However, there is still an obstacle that heterojunctions have the poor interface characteristics which may degrade the stability of devices.\n2.3.2 | Homojunction Structure\nCompared to those with heterojunctions, homojunctionbased oxide TFTs have better interface properties due to the bonding between homogeneous materials. Thus, these TFTs have better stability due to their lower interface trap density.260 Generally, homojunction-based oxide TFTs are fabricated by controlling the amount of VO or the composition of channel materials in each layer. There are two representative studies on vacuum-processed oxide TFTs using a homojunction structure.\nWeng et al. reported homojunction-based IGO bilayer TFTs with improved electrical properties by varying the In and Ga composition of each IGO film (Figure 7A).265 The front channel layers were deposited under radio frequency (RF) powers of Ga2O3:In2O3 = 90 W:60 W for high conductivity, and the back channel layers were deposited under various RF powers for In2O3, while fixing the RF power on the Ga2O3 target to 100 W.\nFigure 7B shows the energy band diagram according to In and Ga composition, controlled by the sputtering power of the Ga2O3 and In2O3 targets. As the content of In2O3 versus Ga2O3 decreased, the bandgap and the difference between the conduction band and Fermi level\n(ΔEc) increased because the Ga2O3 films have a relatively large bandgap of about 4.9 eV. Under the optimal deposition condition of the back IGO channel (RF power of Ga2O3:In2O3 = 100 W:60 W), IGO bilayer TFTs showed their best electrical characteristics with a field-effect mobility of 45.9 cm2/Vs and a current on/off ratio of 1.7 × 106. When investigating the energy band diagram of oxide semiconductor–insulator-gate under the off-state\n(VGS < 0) and on-state (VGS > 0), it was confirmed that on-current was increased by lowering barrier height between the front channel and back channel under the on-state, and the leakage current decreased with ΔEc ≥ 1.0 eV, as shown in Figure 7C. This reduced carrier transport from the front channel to the back channel under the off-state.\nUnlike the studies above, Ast et al. recently fabricated homojunction-based IGZO TFTs using c-axis aligned crystalline (CAAC) IGZO layers.198 Figure 7D shows Xray diffraction (XRD) data of IGZO films deposited at room temperature (RT), 260C, and 310C. While the IGZO films deposited at RT and 260C showed weak scattering near 31, corresponding to a-IGZO, the IGZO films deposited at 310C have a sharp peak at 30, which implies a CAAC structure. Based on these XRD results, TFTs with the following structures were fabricated to investigate the effects of a-IGZO/CAAC IGZO bilayer structure: a-IGZO (deposited at 260C), CAAC IGZO (deposited at 310C), and a-IGZO (deposited at 260C)/ CAAC IGZO (deposited at 310C). It has been reported\n![10_image_0.png](10_image_0.png)\nthat the CAAC IGZO TFTs exhibit extraordinarily low leakage current (<1 pA) and superior photo-bias stability, but its field-effect mobility is comparable to that of conventional a-IGZO TFTs (~10 cm 2 /Vs). 334 Similar to the report above, the field-effect mobility of CAAC IGZO and a-IGZO TFTs were 12.8 and 15.3 cm 2 /Vs, respectively, as shown in Figure 7E. However, when TFT devices were composed of a bilayer structure, based on a CAAC IGZO\nI SHINGLESS PHS COOL OL TRANS\nm 1, or 108. [1,200 10/21] no carade] online coliW shimni col front channel and an a-IGZO back channel, the fieldeffect mobility significantly increased to 20.6 cm2/Vs.\nThis improvement in field-effect mobility was caused by the upper a-IGZO layer which acted as an impurity getter in the CAAC IGZO layers. Consequently, a-IGZO/CAAC\nIGZO bilayer TFTs showed better electrical characteristics than CAAC IGZO and a-IGZO TFTs.\n2.3.3 | Self-Aligned Structure\n602 KIM ET AL.\nFor next-generation display backplanes with increasing resolution and frame rate, the low parasitic capacitance and high mobility of pixel TFTs are required, to charge the pixel in a shorter period. As parasitic capacitance from the overlap between gate and S/D can cause higher noise and lag in pixel TFTs, a self-aligned structure has been widely researched to minimize this overlap between gate and S/D.\nChoi et al. investigated top-gate self-aligned IGZO\nTFTs using deep-ultraviolet (DUV) irradiation to reduce the overlap between gate and S/D electrodes, and contact resistance.204 As shown in Figure 7F, IGZO TFTs with a top-gate self-aligned structure were fabricated using DUV\nirradiation on contact region. In the contact region irradiated with DUV, VO were generated by the strong energy of DUV. Thus, the on-current level of the device increased as the energy of the DUV increased by lowering the contact resistance with the metal of the S/D, then field-effect mobility was also improved, as shown in Figure 7G and 7H. Consequently, this approach not only provides a simple and cost-effective process by reducing the photomask for device fabrication but also provides improved electrical characteristics with a field-effect mobility of 22.00 cm2/Vs and S. S of 0.24 V/dec.\n2.3.4 | High-Κ Dielectric\nHigh-κ dielectric materials are promising materials for gate insulators in TFT devices because of their excellent electrical properties such as high dielectric constant, high breakdown field intensity, and large bandgap. As a result of these advantages, many high-κ rare-earth dielectrics have been suggested to replace SiO2 as a gate insulator for oxide semiconductor TFTs. However, these high-κ rare-earth materials can easily absorb water molecules to form hydroxides.335 Chen et al. explored the electrical characteristics of Ti-doped high-κ rare-earth dielectrics\n(CeTixOy, ErTixOy, and YbTixOy) in IZTO TFTs because Ti can hinder the reaction between oxide films and water molecules.258 Figure 7I shows the capacitance-voltage curve of metal–insulator–metal (MIM) devices with CeTixOy, ErTixOy, and YbTixOy. The MIM device with CeTixOy exhibited the highest capacitance among these high-κ rare-earth dielectrics (dielectric constant values of CeTixOy, ErTixOy, and YbTixOy films are determined to be ~29.8, 22.8, and 26.1, respectively). However, the MIM\ndevice with CeTixOy has higher leakage current than those of other dielectric film due to rougher surface at the dielectric/electrode interface while YbTixOy has the lowest leakage current with smoother surface. Consequently, IZTO TFTs with YbTixOy gate insulator showed the best electrical characteristics with a field-effect mobility of 20.8 cm2/Vs, a S. S of 0.108 V/dec, and a current on/off ratio of 3.0 × 108, compared with those of other dielectrics (Figure 7J). In addition to the studies mentioned above in Section 2, reports on high-performance vacuum-processed n-type oxide TFTs through material, process, and structural engineering, are categorized and summarized in Table 1.\n3 | P-Type Oxide Semiconductor-Based Tfts\nThe significant achievements in n-type oxide TFTs have led to interest in the development of p-type oxide TFTs. These are of critical importance for the development of displays and integrated circuits because p-n junctions and CMOS logic circuits enable fast response time, low heat generation, high circuit density, and low power consumption compared to the unipolar-type devices.336 However, as shown in Figure 8, vacuum-processed ptype oxide TFTs have not been investigated much compared with their n-type oxide TFTs (since 2010, the proportion of papers on these are less than 10% of those on n-type). This lack of research is due to the following reasons: (i) the hole conduction path in a valance band maximum (VBM) consists of localized O 2p orbitals, which leads to a high hole effective mass,337 and (ii) it is difficult to achieve high hole concentration because the acceptor formation energy is higher than that of the donor.338 Therefore, while the average field-effect mobility of ntype oxide TFTs is about 20.51 cm2/Vs from 2010 to 2018, the average of p-types is quite lower (about 1.83 cm2/Vs),\nas shown in Figure 9. From the above results, it can be inferred that research of p-type oxide TFTs is still in an early stage of development; thus, most of the studies have been focused on materials and structural aspects. In the following section, the latest studies on high-performance vacuum-processed p-type oxide TFTs published in journals within the top 25% (Q1) of JCR since 2010 are discussed, in terms of material and structural engineering approaches.\nTABLE 1 Summarized experimental details and electrical characteristics of high-performance vacuum-processed n-type oxide thin-film transistors (TFTs) in terms of material, process,and structural engineering methodsApproach\n| In2O3/Ga O2 3 Sputter 51.3 0.38 1.0 × 108 Si N3 4 −3.0 ~ 2.0, 0.1 Wang et al.95   | Sputter 63 0.073 1.0 × 106 HfO2 - Hsu et al.175 2014 IGZO: Ti/IGZO   | IGZO/ITO Sputter 80 - 1.0 × 108 SiO2 −20.0 ~ 20.0, 30.0 Chung et al.176   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Structure: Heterojunction structure                                               |                                                                      |                                                                           |\nChanneldeposition method Field-effect mobility[cm2/Vs]\nChannelmaterial Material: Oxygen vacancymodulation ZnO ALD 21.3 0.39 ~107 Al2O3 −2.0 ~ 10.0, 0.1 Genget al.163 2014 2014\nZnO/SnO2 PLD 37.0 0.19 1.0 × 1010 Al2O3 −20.0 ~ 30.0, 15.0 Lee et al.171 2014IZTO Sputter 31.75 - 1.0 × 108 SiO2 −20.0 ~ 25.0, 10.0 Li et al.226 2016\n| ITZO Sputter 30.8 1.0 - SiO2 - Jia et al.201 2015   | TZO Sputter 66.7 0.333 2.0 × 107 SiO2 - Han et al.235 2016   | Material: Doping IZO:C Sputter 32.3 0.55 6.2 × 107 Al2O3 −30.0 ~ 30.0, 20.0 Parthiban et al.169   | InO:Nd Sputter 20.4 0.17 ~106 AlOx:Nd −10.0 ~ 10.0, 10.0 Lin et al.197 2015   | ZnMgO:H Sputter 32.2 0.31 ~107 SiO2 −50.0 ~ 50.0, 1.0 Xu et al.227 2016   | IGZO:N Sputter 20.68 0.38 4.79 × 108 SiO2 −30.0 ~ 30.0, 10.1 Shin et al.257 2017   | ZnO Sputter 60.0 0.16 5 × 106 SiO2 −5.0 ~ 10.0, 5.0 Ye and Wong96   | ZnO Sputter 71 0.18 1 × 107 SiO2 −5.0 ~ 5.0, 5.0 Ye and Wong97   | IGZO Sputter 39.8 0.21 ~106 HfLaO −5.0 ~ 10.0, 5.0 Qian and Lai173   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Process: Plasma                                     | treatment                                                    |                                                                                                   |                                                                               |                                                                           |                                                                                    |                                                                     |                                                                  |                                                                      |\nIZO Sputter 65.8 0.13 1.5 × 106 SiO2 solidelectrolyte\n−2.0 ~ 1.0, 1.2 Yin et al.130 2013 Biased VG,VDa[V] **Ref.**\nS.S[V/dec] On/off ratio Gateinsulator\n| IGZO:N-H Sputter 45.3 0.21 3 × 108 SiO2 −40.0 ~ 40.0, 1.0 Abliz et al264 2017   | Process: Laser annealing IZO Sputter 37.7 0.18 ~107 SiO2 −20.0 ~ 30.0, 0.1 Fujiii et al.128   | IGZO Sputter 43.5 - - SiO2 −20.0 ~ 20.0, 5.0 Bermundo et al.263   | Sputter 35.4 0.623 4.5 × 107 SiO2 - Jo et al.203 2015 SnO2 Process: Microwave annealing   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n![13_image_1.png](13_image_1.png)\n604 KIM ET AL.\n![13_image_0.png](13_image_0.png)\nAverage field-effect mobility trend of vacuumprocessed n- and p-type oxide TFTs is based on the papers published from journals within the top 25% (Q1) in JCR.\n3.1| Material Engineering\nIt is well known that cuprous oxide (Cu2O), tin monoxide\n(SnO), and nickel oxide (NiO) are materials with p-type conduction; thus, studies on p-type oxide TFTs have mainly focused on these materials. In particular, Cu2O\nhas attracted much attention as a p-type oxide material and for its applications, such as TFTs, solar cells, and gas sensors. Unlike most oxide semiconductors, which have a localized valance band formed by anisotropic O 2p orbitals, Cu2O has better carrier transport properties due to forming a hybridized orbital between the Cu 3d and O\n2p orbitals.361 As a result, single crystalline Cu2O has a high Hall mobility, of more than 100 cm 2/Vs.344 Flewitt et al. investigated the effects of post-annealing temperature on electrical characteristics of Cu2O TFTs fabricated by reactive sputtering.353 When the post-annealing temperature increased, the crystallinity of Cu2O films improved without any phase transition, and Urbach tail of those films, which shows the degree of disorder of a thin film, reduced, as shown in Figure 10A. Because these improvements in crystallinity of Cu2O films reduce hole trapping on defects, such as grain boundaries, the hole transport properties can improve. As a result, the field-effect mobility increased from 0.03 to 0.90 cm 2/Vs when the post-annealing temperature increased from 500C to 700C, as shown in Figure 10B.\nIn addition to sputter deposition, Park et al. recently reported the fabrication of Cu2O TFTs using atomic layer deposition (ALD), based on Cu and ozone (O3) gas precursors.356 In Figure 10C, the schematic energy level of CuOx films according to annealing temperature are shown. It was confirmed that cupric oxide (CuO) films, which have a smaller bandgap and higher hole concentration than Cu2O, were formed at a high annealing temperature, of over 300C. Thus, fabricated CuOx TFTs with a high annealing temperature over 300C showed deteriorated electrical characteristics due to the formation of a conductive CuO phase rather than Cu2O, as shown in Figure 10D.362,363 At the optimized annealing temperature of 300C, CuOx TFTs showed the best electrical characteristics, such as field-effect mobility of 5.64 cm2/Vs, current on/off ratio of 1.79× 10 5 with moderate carrier concentration, compared with other conditions (200\n500C).\nIn the case of SnO, it exhibits p-type characteristics TABLE 1and tends to be easily oxidized to SnO2, which shows n-\n![14_image_0.png](14_image_0.png)\n![14_image_1.png](14_image_1.png)\ntype properties.341,364 Despite the chemical instability of SnO, it has attracted as much interest as Cu2O because of its superior p-type conduction properties, as well as a relatively large bandgap of 2.7–3.4 eV, which is suitable for transparent devices.365 Steudel et al. reported the yttrium (Y) doped SnO\nTFTs to improve the electrical characteristics of p-type oxide TFTs (Figure 10E and F). Typically, when SnO film is deposited with substrate annealing, it starts to form phases of Sn + Sn3O4 and Sn + SnO2 at temperatures above 270 ± 20C and 450C, respectively. In that study, by controlling Y concentration, the Sn4+/Sn2+ ratio and amount of metallic Sn, which induce middle-gap trap states, could be reduced, as shown in Figure 10F.359 The best electrical characteristics were found for 1% Y-doped SnO TFTs, with a field-effect mobility of 1.4 cm2/Vs and a current on/off ratio of 5 × 104.\nAlthough NiO shows excellent chemical stability, compared with Cu2O and SnO,366 which can be easily oxidized into the CuO and SnO2, the hole conduction properties of NiO is quite low because the energy level of Ni vacancy, which can act as an acceptor, is not close to the valence band. Thus, research on p-type oxide TFTs using NiO as a channel layer has proceeded relatively more slowly than those using Cu2O and SnO. Zhang et al. fabricated NiO TFTs using thermally oxidized Ni thin films.347 Under annealing conditions of 400C for 1 h in air, some Ni metal phase remains at the interface between the channel and gate insulator due to the annealing being insufficient to fully oxidize the Ni. However, the remaining Ni in the under oxidized film improves the hole conduction in the p-type oxide TFTs. As a result, NiO TFTs annealed at 400C for 1 h showed superior electrical characteristics, with a field-effect wxl ' V ' U N E ' 1 1 1 1 1 A Support A4988 PPS COOL 01/01 sumor, org cog .[1707/10/1] no carade] online] voliW .shkoH vis\n![15_image_0.png](15_image_0.png)\non/off ratio of 2.2 × 10 3 .\nProcess Engineering 3.2 L\nAs studies on p-type oxide TFTs are still in the early stage, they are mainly focused on the aspect of material engineering. Thus, there is still a lack of studies in terms of process engineering compared with n-type oxide TFTs.\nCheng et al. recently investigated the effects of F plasma treatment on the electrical characteristics of SnO TFTs. 358 Figure 11A and B show the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of Sn 3d and O 1 s peaks of SnO films treated by F plasma. After treatment, the Sn 3d peaks shifted to higher binding energies from 486.3 to 487.0 eV\nfor 3d 5/2 and from 494.7 to 495.3 eV for 3d 3/2. The O\n1 s peak also shifted toward higher binding energy, from 530.3 to 531.1 eV. These results imply that F atoms are incorporated into the SnO film and form either Sn–F or\n![16_image_0.png](16_image_0.png)\nSn–O–F bonds, reducing the number of VO by the substitution of O by F.\nAs a result, F plasma-treated SnO TFTs at a sputter power of 60 W showed relatively high electrical performance, with field-effect mobility of 2.13 cm2/Vs and current on/off ratio of 9.6 × 106, as shown in Figure 11C.\n3.3 | Structure Engineering\nBecause the p-type oxide semiconductor materials have inherently low mobility compared with n-type materials, and because of the localized VBM, several research groups have attempted to improve the electrical characteristics of p-type oxide TFTs by structural engineering techniques (e.g., bilayer, double gate, and high-κ insulator, and so forth).\nAmong p-type oxide semiconductors, SnO is a metastable material and it can easily be oxidized during annealing treatment in air.345 Thus, during lowtemperature annealing at 140–200C, adsorbed oxygen atoms on the surface cause oxidation by a chemical reaction in that region.367 This reaction can increase electrical conductivity because O interstitials in p-type oxides contribute hole carriers. At higher annealing temperatures (200–300C), however, oxidation occurs mainly in the bulk film. Therefore, SnO can be transformed into metallic Sn, Sn3O4, or SnO2, which worsen the p-type electrical characteristics. Based on these principles, Alshareef et al. researched Cu2O/SnO\nbilayer channel TFTs by controlling the thickness of each layer, as shown in Figure 12A and B. Cu2O plays a role as a capping layer for controlling the oxygen stoichiometry of SnO as well as improving the device performance. As a result, these TFTs showed a fieldeffect mobility of 0.66 cm2/Vs.\nHuang et al. reported SnO TFTs using a double-gate structure for improving the electrical performance of devices, as shown in Figure 12C and D.350 It is possible to control the accumulation region at the middle of the channel via this double-gate structure. Carrier transport through middle region of the channel can boost the electrical properties because it is not affected by surface scattering.123 Thus, the field-effect mobility, S. S, and current on/off ratio of double-gate structured SnO TFTs were improved, compared with a bottom-gate structure, from 3.28 to 6.54 cm2/Vs, from 0.547 to 0.143 V/dec, and from 104 to 105, respectively.\nInspired by the use of high-κ dielectrics in n-type oxide TFTs, there have been many attempts to introduce high-κ dielectrics in p-type oxide TFTs as a high-κ gate insulator can easily control the capability of the gate voltage over channel conduction and improves the electrical characteristics of TFTs. Zhao et al. reported the use of a hafnium oxynitride (HfON) high-κ gate insulator for topgated CuxO TFTs. CuxO channel films were deposited with different substrate temperatures from 400C to 700C (Figure 12E and F). Based on the XRD data shown in Figure 12E, the grain sizes of CuxO films were calculated via the Scherrer formula to be 42, 27, and 22 nm for films deposited at 500C, 600C, and 700C, respectively.368 Mobility can decrease with higher substrate temperature because of the increased grain boundary scattering. Consequently, the field-effect mobility of Cu2O TFTs deposited at a substrate temperature of 500C\nwith HfON gate insulator was 4.3 cm2/Vs, more than five times higher than that of TFTs deposited at 700C.343 In addition to the studies mentioned above in Section 3, the reports on high-performance vacuumprocessed p-type oxide TFTs through material and structural engineering are categorized and summarized in Table 2.\n.ing soiled 44988888881/job/uco.colw.cardionitro.bie/vc onoЭ bassumoд on 208 [1:202 10/61] no varadil onlin0 voliW stilesH plies\n![17_image_0.png](17_image_0.png)\n- 4 Oxide Based Cmos Circuits\nCMOS circuits with the complementary characteristics of n- and p-type oxide TFTs can play an important role for inverting of the inputs. These circuits have many advantages such as low power consumption, and high integration density, as mentioned in Section 3; thus, attempts have been made to fabricate the CMOS circuits consisting of both n- and p-type oxide channel materials. In this section, we introduce recent studies on the fabrication of these.\nSong et al. investigated complementary integrated circuits, composed of the p-type SnO and the n-type IGZO TFTs, suitable for large-scale fabrication at RT. 360 To optimizing the threshold voltage, the CMOS\ngeometric aspect ratio, defined as the width (W) to length (L) ratio of p-type oxide TFTs divided by the W to L ratio of n-type oxide TFTs, was set to 5, as shown in Figure 13A.

Thus, increasing the field-effect mobility of oxide TFTs has become a major research subject. In this review, we focused on the approaches applied to increase the fieldeffect mobility of both n- and p-type oxide TFTs. As shown in Figure 14, the techniques used to increase the field-effect mobility are summarized in terms of material, process, and structural aspects. As IGZO TFTs used for commercialization typically exhibit field-effect mobility of about 10 cm2/Vs, many attempts have been made to increase their mobility by material, process, and structural engineering for oxide TFTs. As a result of the latest advances and rapid developments summarized in this review, the field-effect mobility of oxide TFTs has improved considerably. Contrary to the rapid developments in n-type oxide TFTs, p-type oxide TFTs are still in an early stage of development, as the number of published papers and the electrical parameters of p-type TFTs are much lower. As shown in this summary, researchers continue to develop further technologies of key materials, innovative processes, and novel structures that can increase the field-effect mobility of both n- and p-type oxide TFTs. The improved field-effect mobility of n-type oxide TFTs will enable them to be used in various applications including memory devices and sensors, as well as driving circuits for high-end displays. In addition, the development of p-type oxide TFTs with electrical performances comparable with those of n-type oxide TFTs would have a great potential in the display industry because CMOS logic circuits based on both n- and ptype oxide TFTs enable bezel-less and low power consumption display. We believe that by addressing the problems presented, vacuum-processed oxide TFTs will become the pivotal technology for the next-generation Internet of Things (IoT) in the Fourth Industrial Revolution.\nKIM ET AL. 611 1.

The experimental results show that the sheet resistance of the Hf-treated a-IGZO\nlayer can be as low as 408 Ω/□. The a-IGZO TFT fabricated in the proposed processes shows excellent electrical performances, such as a field effect mobility of 16.6 cm2\n/V·s, a subthreshold swing of 0.20 V/dec, an on/off current ratio over 109\n, and high stability against electrical stress.\nAuthor Keywords Amorphous indium-gallium-zinc oxide (a-IGZO), self-aligned, Hafnium (Hf), thin-film transistor (TFT), stability.\n Introduction Thin-film transistors (TFTs) based on amorphous oxide semiconductor (AOS) materials have attracted considerable attention in recent years for their excellent performance and reliability, which makes them competitive in flat-panel display and transparent electronics areas. Among these AOSs, amorphous-Indium-Gallium-Zinc-Oxide\n (a-IGZO) is very promising because of its high carrier mobility (>10 cm2\nsteep subthreshold swing, excellent on/off current ratio, low processing temperature and good uniformity .\nAmong various structures of AOS TFT, the bottom-gate\n(BG) structure with the back-channel etching (BCE) process is mainly used for the fabrication of a-IGZO TFTs at present .\nHowever, the BG structure is less suitable for the application of high-resolution displays and high-speed circuits due to the high parasitic capacitance caused by the overlap between the source\n/drain (S/D) and the gate electrode. By comparison, the top gate\n(TG) structure is free of the large parasitic capacitance if a selfaligned (SA) fabrication process is established , .\nFor the SATG AOS TFTs, one major technical issue is the formation of the self-aligned source/drain (S/D) regions, which must be highly conductive and thermally stable . Various methods for enhancing the conductivity of the S/D regions have been proposed, such as ion implantations , , hydrogen doping , and Ar, SiH4, or NH3 plasma treatments . Nevertheless, those methods have some shortcomings that cannot be ignored, such as the high annealing temperature for the ion implantations, the undesirable lateral diffusion for the hydrogen doping, and the poor thermal stability for the plasma treatments . Furthermore, SATG a-IGZO TFTs where the S/D regions were reduced by metallic aluminum (Al) have been proposed , . As reported, the sheet resistance of the S/D regions with this method is low and remains stable, even after subsequent thermal processes. In addition, magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca) have also been used to enhance the conductivity of the S/D regions , . Therefore, the use of metal reaction is a promising method to form the self-aligned S/D regions of SATG AOS TFTs.\nIn this work, hafnium (Hf) has been shown to be an effective reaction metal element for the first time. We have also used Hf to implement SATG a-IGZO TFTs with the metal reaction method. The proposed process in this work features a sputtered deposition of Hf film onto S/D regions for a short time and the following thermal treatment at 250℃ in the presence of an oxygen atmosphere. The fabricated SATG a-IGZO TFTs show high electrical performances and strong scalability, as well as excellent stability under electrical stress.\n Experimental Details Fig. 1 shows a cross-sectional view of the fabrication processes for the SATG a-IGZO TFTs. Firstly, a 40-nm-thick aIGZO layer was deposited on the glass substrate by DC\nmagnetron sputtering at room temperature (RT). After the aIGZO layer was patterned to form the active islands with wet etching, a nitrous oxide (N2O) plasma treatment was performed for 120 seconds at 300 °C. Subsequently, a 200-nm-thick silicon dioxide (SiO2) was deposited at 300 °C as the gate insulator (GI) using plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). Following a 300 °C annealing in O2 ambient for 1.5 hours, a 150-nm-thick molybdenum (Mo) layer as the gate electrode was deposited by DC magnetron sputtering. After the gate stack (Mo and SiO2) was patterned with dry etching, the wafer was annealed in O2 ambient at 300 °C for 0.5 hours to eliminate the possible defects induced by the gate stack dry etching.\na-IGZO TFT with hafnium-induced S/D.\nFollowing is a 3-nm-thick Hf film that was sputtered onto the exposed a-IGZO layer as the S/D regions before thermal annealing in the presence of an oxygen atmosphere for 30 minutes. The thermal treatment temperatures varied from 100℃\nto 350 °C. Afterward, a 200-nm-thick layer of SiO2 was deposited at 150 ℃ by PECVD to form a passivation layer (PL)\nISSN 0097-996X/23/5401-0580-$1.00 © 2023 \nand then patterned to open contact holes for S/D metal electrodes by dry etching. Finally, the S/D electrodes of 80-nmthick Mo were formed with a lift-off process. The electrical properties of the fabricated SATG a-IGZO TFTs were characterized using an Agilent B1500 semiconductor parameter analyzer under an ambient atmosphere at room temperature in the dark.\nResults And Discussion 3.\nFig. 2 shows the sheet resistances and carrier concentration of the Hf-reacted a-IGZO films versus the thermal treatment temperatures. They were directly exported from the Ecopia HMS-3000 Hall Effect Measurement System. Before the Hf deposition and thermal treatment, the sheet resistance of the a- IGZO film is over 10 9 Ω/ 1 and the carrier concentration is about 10 13 cm -3 . As shown, the carrier concentration of the a-IGZO\nfilm increases up to the order of 10 20 cm -3 after the Hf treatment.\nObviously, with the sharp increase in carrier concentration, the sheet resistance of the a-IGZO film was significantly reduced to 408 Ω/ □ at 250 °C. And the increase of the sheet resistivity after 250 °C may be attributed to the oxidation of the a-IGZO layer.\nFig. 3 (a) and (b) show the transfer and output characteristics of a SATG TFT, respectively, with hafniuminduced S/D regions fabricated using the proposed process at 250 °C. The a-IGZO TFT with a channel length of 13 µ m shows a subthreshold swing (SS) of 0.20 V/decade, field-effect mobility ( µ fe ) of 16.6 cm 2 /V s, and an on/off current ratio\n( Ion /Iott ) exceeding 1×10 9 at V Ds = 10.1 V. In terms of the output characteristics, no current crowding phenomenon is observed in the linear region, indicating that the source/drain parasitic resistance ( Rsd ) is very low.\nAs shown in Fig. 4 (a), almost no threshold voltage ( V th )\nshift or no SS degradation was observed, indicating the excellent scalability of Hf-induced SATG TFTs. Fig. 4 (b) shows the width normalized total resistance ( RTOTW ) versus channel length different V GS . R TOT is calculated from the transfer to at characteristics at Vps = 0.1 V with various channel lengths. The width normalized RsD ( RsDW ) can be extracted from the intercept of the fitting lines by the transfer length method\n(TLM), and is evaluated to be 19 Ω cm. It is worth mentioning that the R SD in this work was surely overestimated due to the non-optimized layout design. Because the distance from the metal contact to the a-IGZO channel is approximately 75 µ m, which is much longer than what is necessary. With an optimal layout, the R SD could be definitely further reduced. In addition, the shrinkage of the channel length AL is evaluated to be approximately 0.11 µ m, much smaller than that for S/D regions formed by Ar plasma and H doping .\nMoreover, the electrical stability of AOS TFTs is also of vital importance. The fabricated TFTs were then investigated by subjecting the transistors to negative gate stress (NBS) and positive bias stress (PBS) with V Gs respectively of − 20 V and 20 V. Fig. 5(b) shows the evolution of transfer characteristics of fabricated TFTs under PBS, where the drain current ( IDS ) versus gate voltage ( V G S ) was measured at the drain voltage ( V D S ) of 10.1 V. Under PBS, the transfer curves of fabricated transistors slightly shifted towards positive by 0.8 V, related to the charge injection into GI or charge trapping at AOS/GI interfaces . By contrast, the transfer curves remain unchanged after 3600 seconds of NBS, as shown in Fig. 5(a). These results suggest that the SATG a-IGZO TFTs with Hf-reaction S/D do not suffer additional instability issues and maintain good stability under electrical stress.\nonline) follow, valen to but survit out sog (trent)\nA thin film sputtering of Hf and then performing thermal annealing in oxygen can turn the a-IGZO film from a highresistive state into a high-conductive state. The Hf-induced method has been well demonstrated for forming high-conductive SA S/D regions of TG a-IGZO TFTs. The a-IGZO TFT\nfabricated in the proposed processes shows excellent electrical performances, such as a field effect mobility of 16.6 cm2\n/V·s, a subthreshold swing of 0.20 V/dec, an on/off current ratio over 109\n, and high stability against electrical stress.\n5. **Acknowledgements**"

We have fabricated an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display with more than 5000 ppi, which is required in virtual reality (VR) displays, by using CAAC-OS FETs as the backplane.\nIGZO; VR; OLED; High resolution**; Micro display**\n1. Introduction\nVirtual reality (VR) technologies have recently been attracting a lot of attention [1–3]. One of the requirements for the development of more realistic VR worlds is the fabrication of displays with higher resolutions [4–6]. For example, head-mounted displays (HMD) used for VR require displays with more than 5000 pixels per inch (ppi) \nto prevent users from noticing the pixels when looking at them from a short distance. Recently developed small, medium, and large displays utilize field-effect transistors \n(FET) the size of a few micrometers, but the fabrication of a high-resolution display with more than 5000 ppi would require the use of FETs smaller than a micrometer within the pixels. However, scaled down FETs may negatively affect the display performance due to phenomena such as the short channel effect. \nOxide semiconductors (OS) have the advantage of not requiring a laser crystallization process, which has recently made them widely used as an alternative to lowtemperature polycrystalline silicon (LTPS) and hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) backplanes. A \nnotable example of OS is the indium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO), first synthesized by Kimizuka et al. in 1985 and widely researched since [7–10]. Table 1 shows a classification of crystallinity of IGZO material. Yamazaki et al. proposed a crystalline-oxide semiconductor named c-axis aligned crystalline IGZO (CAAC-IGZO). For CAAC-IGZO, Kimizuka has concluded that it is neither crystal nor amorphous but \"an intermediate state\" between crystal and amorphous states . Here, a crystallinity in the intermediate state is defined as crystalline where nano crystal (nc) IGZO and others are also classified. FETs that employ the crystalline IGZO in their active layer exhibit favorable characteristics . \nFor example, in contrast to Si-FETs, FETs with a CAACIGZO active layer have an extremely low off-state current and a high on–off ratio, and they are less likely to suffer from a short channel effect. Thus, CAAC-IGZO also exhibits an advantage in terms of scaling . In this paper we propose a high-resolution organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display with more than 5000 ppi that utilizes a CAAC-OS FET backplane. \n2. Motivation For Displays With A Pixel Density Of 5000 Ppi\nIn one type of VR applications, users wear an HMD \nand images are projected through a display mounted in the headset. Hence, wearable displays in the form of goggles and glasses are being developed as HMDs. If lenses are not being used, the distance between the HMD display and the eyes of the person wearing the headset is between 12 mm and 40 mm. According to the calculation completed by R. N. Clark, the visual acuity of human eye is 0.59 arcminutes per line pair . Based on this visual acuity and assuming that the distance between the eyes and the display is 30 mm, headset wearers would not be able to notice each pixel in front of their eyes if the pixel pitch is approximately equal to 5.15 μm. This pixel pitch corresponds to approximately 5000 ppi. Therefore, the projection of realistic VR images in an HMD would be enabled by incorporating a high-resolution display with more than 5000 ppi. \n3. Properties Of Caac-Os Fet\nThe resolution of displays used in smartphones is between 400 ppi and 500 ppi, whereas VR requires displays with more than 5000 ppi. In other words, the size of each sub-pixel of a realistic VR display would be approximately 3 μm, meaning the transistors used in \ndevices similar to smartphones are too large and unsuitable for the purpose. Moreover, the amount of electric current that flows in each pixel of OLED displays is proportional to the pixel size, hence the amount of electric current that flows through the device would be smaller. Consequently, backplanes for displays with more than 5000 ppi would require the following properties: \ni) Transistors with a short length. \nii) Current capability suitable to control an OLED \nFor this reason, we adopted CAAC-OS FETs for the backplane. As shown in Figure 1 (a), a CAAC-OS FET exhibits favorable Id-Vg characteristics even though its width (W) and length (L**) are equal to 60 nm (**W/L  **60** \nnm/60 nm). Figure 1 (b) **shows the FET's gate breakdown** \nvoltage. The gate leakage is virtually negligible up to 10 V.\nwidth and length equal to 60 nm. The sample size is 6 and Vds **is set to 0.1 V (black line) or 1.2 V (red line). (b) Gate** \nAs Si and LTPS FETs have a large current capability, when they are used as OLED driving transistors, their length and saturation are increased and their current capability is limited. Furthermore, when their length is increased, their layout area also increases, meaning they cannot be arranged to fit the current values of high pixel density suitable for OLED displays, and this affects what is shown. In contrast, CAAC-OS FETs exhibit good saturation characteristics even when their length is short and a suitable amount of current flows to control OLED \ndevices. Hence, CAAC-OS FETs could be used for backplanes of high-resolution OLED displays. \nAn additional feature of a CAAC-OS FET is its extremely low off-state current. As shown in Figure 1, the off-state current is smaller than 1  10−12 **A, which is** \nbelow the measurement limit. Therefore, when the display shows black, the amount of electric current that flows would be extremely small, leading to a low power consumption. \n4. Circuit Configuration And Operation\nFigure 2 shows a block diagram of a scan driver, and Figure 3 shows one of the shift registers (SRs) composing the scan driver. The proposed scan driver is configured with shift registers connected in series. A gate start pulse (GSP) is input into the first-stage shift register, and with four-layer GCLK and GPWC, the first-stage shift register generates a shift pulse at GSROUT and a gate signal at GOUT for the next-stage shift register. \nThe shift pulse and the gate signal are generated and output by GOUT and GSROUT (Figure. 3) respectively in the following manner. \nFirst, an RES signal initializes the voltage of node 01 to GVSS and that of node 02 to GVDD-Vth (Vth **corresponds** \nto the threshold voltage of the OS FET). At this point, GOUT and GSROUT are both fixed at GVSS. \nThen the shift pulse of GSROUT in the previous stage is input to LIN, changing the voltage of node 01 to GVDD-Vth **and that of node 02 to GVSS. The voltage of** node 01, GVDD-Vth**, is input to node 0A via M6, and to** \nnode OB via M9. Thus, M7 and M10 are turned on. Node 02 is connected to the gates of M8 and M11 and turns them off. \nWith M7 and M10 turned on as described above, the voltages of GOUT and GSROUT increase when CLK1 and PWC1 are changed from LOW to HIGH. With this, bootstrap capacitors C2 and C3 increase the gate voltages of M7 and M10 from GVDD-Vth**. Thus GOUT and** \nGSROUT output the shift pulse and the gate signal, respectively, without a drop in the Vth**. In this case M6 and** \nM9 contribute to efficiently increasing the gate voltages of M7 and M10. \n![3_image_0.png](3_image_0.png) \n5. Pixel Structure\nFigure 4(a) shows a sub-pixel circuit diagram of our display prototype using an OLED device. The configuration of each pixel is 2Tr1C. In all the sub-pixels, the selection FET, M1, is an OS-FET with W/L  **60** \nnm/60 nm, and the driving FET, M2, is an OS-FET with W/L  **200 nm/60 nm. The symbol C1 represents a storage** \nAs the display prototype is of a high pixel density, the pixels are arranged in a zigzag pattern similar to that in , as shown in Figure 4(b). The sub-pixel pitch is equal to 2.4 μm horizontally and 3.2 μm vertically, and all pixels that emit light from the red, green, and blue (R, G, \nand B) of the display prototype are configured to have the same pixel pitch. \nThe limit of human vision is reported to be 60 cycles per degree. Thus, if more than 60 light–dark cycles occur at a viewing angle of 1**, humans would not be able to** \ndistinguish light and dark and would perceive an intermediate color instead. \nFor best quality, smartphones should be viewed from a distance of approximately 30 cm. The estimated distinguishable resolution is then approximately equal to 500 ppi and the visual acuity is 60 cycles per degree. \nA person would not be able to distinguish between a zigzag arrangement and a stripe arrangement in such a display since it is not possible for the human eye to distinguish each pixel at a pixel density surpassing 5000 ppi. \nMoreover, a zigzag arrangement allows for the pixels to form a square at 2  **2 pixels (approximately 2500 ppi).** \nThus, the zigzag arrangement will show virtually no effect on visibility. \n6. Panel Structure\nThe scan drivers and protection circuits (PC) surrounding the pixels consist of n-type OS-FETs, formed in the same layer and same process as the pixels' selection and driving FETs. Thus, the formation of all these components does not result in an increased number of process steps. \n7. Specifications And Display Image\nTable 2 reveals the specifications of the display prototype, which achieved a pixel density of 5291 ppi by using CAAC-OS FETs that are between 60 nm and 200 nm in size and by scaling down the sub-pixel pitch to 2.4 μm  **3.2 μm. The constructed display prototype is** \ndesigned with a frame frequency of 120 Hz for VR use. \n| Table 2.

Conclusion\nWe fabricated a high-resolution OLED display prototype with 5291 ppi by using CAAC-OS FETs as the backplane. CAAC-OS FETs can be scaled down and have exhibited their capability to control the electric current necessary for the small pixels in a display with a pixel density of more than 5000 ppi. There is a demand for 3-inch displays in VR applications, and the next challenge in our work would be to enlarge the screen size. "

        "text": "5291-Ppi Microdisplay Using Caac-Igzo Fet With Channel Length Of 60 Nm\nHideaki Shishido, Shuichi Katsui, Hidetomo Kobayashi, Takashi Nakagawa, Yuki Tamatsukuri, Shogo Uesaka, Takaaki Nagata, Tomoya Aoyama, Yutaka Okazaki, Takayuki Ikeda, and Shunpei Yamazaki Semiconductor Energy Laboratory Co. Ltd., Kanagawa Japan \nFor high-definition microdisplays with more than several thousands of pixels per inch (ppi), c-axis-aligned crystal indium-gallium-zinc oxide (CAAC-IGZO) field-effect transistors (FETs) are effective devices. Based on such a viewpoint, we have fabricated a 5291-ppi organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display using CAAC-IGZO FETs with a channel length of 60 nm. \nCAAC-IGZO; Microdisplay; OLED; High-definition \n1. Background\nWith a recent surge of interest in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies, the development of microdisplays used for AR/VR devices has been advanced. For higher display quality, particularly, in VR devices, highresolution and high-definition displays are required. \nFor example, head-mounted displays used as VR devices have an issue called screen-door effect such that border lines between pixels become visible when a user is looking at a display screen at a close distance between the user's eye and the display screen. To avoid the screen-door effect, high-definition displays with more than several thousands ppi are required in view of human visual mechanism . Against such a background, the development targeting at high-definition displays for VR devices has progressed, and many reports have been made in a variety of display conferences and academic societies . \nUse of submicron-sized transistors are necessary to achieve a high-definition display with more than several thousands ppi. As such a high-definition display, products using single crystal silicon (Si) have been developed. However, the existing displays have the following issues. When transistors using single crystal Si are scaled down, they suffer non-negligible short-channel effects, which may lead to significant display performance degradation. The available voltage range is narrowed with scaling; meanwhile, backplanes for the OLED display need to have sufficiently high breakdown voltage so that the display expresses adequate grayscale. Moreover, in OLED displays, the pixel size becomes small as the resolution is increased, which causes a reduction in the amount of current flowing per pixel needed for emitting light from the OLED. Thus, the backplanes also need to have an appropriate current driving capability to control the OLED. \nWith respect to the above issues of high-definition display, our idea is to adopt oxide semiconductor (OS), which is under development as a new material replacing low-temperature polycrystalline silicon (LTPS) or hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H), for backplanes. The research on OS, particularly, indium-gallium-zinc oxide (IGZO), has been conducted widely since Kimizuka et al synthesized IGZO in 1985 . Through the research on IGZO, we discovered CAAC-IGZO  and have fabricated displays using CAAC-IGZO. As one of features of CAAC-IGZO, it has a structure belonging to an \"intermediate state\" between an amorphous structure and a crystalline structure . Due to extremely low carrier density in CAAC-IGZO, FETs using CAAC-IGZO for an active layer exhibit an extremely low off-state current on the order of yAPm (10-24 APm) . In addition, CAAC-IGZO is less likely to be affected by shortchannel effects, which makes CAAC-IGZO effective in scaling of FETs . Thus, application of CAAC-IGZO to LSI such as memory, as well as to displays, has been proposed . \nWe have worked on the development of high-definition displays using CAAC-IGZO FETs, for example, displays with 600 to 1000 ppi including CAAC-IGZO FETs with a channel length of 1.5 Pm fabricated over a glass substrate . \nBesides, aiming at expanding the CAAC-IGZO technology to LSI \nprocess over a Si substrate, we have worked on scaling CAACIGZO FETs and succeed in fabrication of transistors with a channel length on the order of hundreds to several tens nanometers. With use of the scaled CAAC-IGZO FETs, we developed high-definition displays with 2000 ppi and 5000 ppi and reported them at SID Display Week in 2019 . \nConsidering the above, CAAC-IGZO FETs are effective in high-definition microdisplays with more than several thousands ppi. This reports shows features of scaled CAAC-IGZO FET and a high-definition (over 5000 ppi) OLED display using the CAACIGZO FETs. \n2. Characteristics Of Caac-Igzo Fet\nFigure 1 shows a structure of a scaled CAAC-IGZO FET and its cross-sectional images. Figure 1(a) is a perspective view of the CAAC-IGZO FET, Fig. 1(b) is the cross-sectional image in the channel length direction (AA' direction in Fig. 1(a)), and Fig. \n1(c) is the cross-sectional image in the channel width direction \n(BB' direction in Fig. 1(a)). The CAAC-IGZO FET has a tri-gate structure improving the electric field control by the gate, where the gate electrode covers a channel. \nFigure 2 shows *Vg-I*d characteristics of CAAC-IGZO FET with a channel width (W) and channel length (L) of 60 nm. The characteristics are favorable, despite the small FET size (L 60 nm). The off-state current is below the measurement limit (1u1012 A), which means that the CAAC-IGZO FET has an extremely low off-state current. Such a low off-state current enables the amount of current flowing through OLED in a black display to be significantly small. Thus, clearer black display becomes possible, and power consumption is reduced. \nFigure 4 shows Vd-Id characteristics of CAAC-IGZO FET with WL 60 nm200 nm. The favorable saturation is observed even with the FET with L 200 nm. In the case of drive FETs using \n21-1 / H. Shishido Invited Paper\nsingle crystal or LTPS with high current driving capability, their channel lengths are made large so that saturation is enhanced, and their current capabilities are reduced. However, an increase in a channel length causes an increase in layout area, which is disadvantageous for high-definition display with over 5000 ppi. In contrast, the CAAC-IGZO FET has favorable saturation even when the channel length is short, and makes the sufficient amount of current flow to control OLEDs. This suggests that CAACIGZO is suitable material for backplanes for high-definition OLED panels.\n3. 5291-ppi OLED display with CAAC-IGZO FET \nWe made a prototype of 5291-ppi OLED display using the \nabove CAAC-IGZO FETs . Specifications of the prototyped panel are summarized in Table 1. The screen diagonal is 0.28 \ninch, and the resolution is 1280 u 720 (HD). With use of scaled \nCAAC-IGZO FETs with channel lengths of 60 nm and 200 nm, display with high definition such as 5291 ppi was achieved.

The pixel circuits and the scan drivers are formed using CAAC-IGZO FETs. The scan drivers are located on the right and left sides of the pixel region. The gate lines in the odd-numbered rows are driven by the left scan driver, and the gate lines in the even-numbered rows are driven by the right scan driver. The source driver is implemented in an IC using Si FETs. \nFigure 6 shows the pixel circuit of the prototyped panel. The pixel circuit is composed of two transistors and one capacitor, including a selection FET M1, a drive FET M2, and a storage capacitor Cs. Both the selection FET M1 (WL 60 nm60 nm) and the drive FET M2 (WL 60 nm200 nm) are CAAC-IGZO \nFETs which ensures sufficient breakdown voltage and saturation even with the small FET size.

The scan driver includes a shift register, a clock signal line (CLK), a pulsed width control signal line (PWC), a start pulse (SP), back-gate control signals (BG1 and BG2), and a reset signal (RES).

Figure 8(b) is a timing chart of the shift register that cuts out and outputs the waveforms of the clock signal lines or the pulse-width control signal lines at a predetermined time by using a bootstrap operation.

Future Work\nWe have succeeded in fabrication of memory using CAACIGZO FETs monolithically stacked on a circuit fabricated with Si FETs, aiming at application of scaled CAAC-IGZO FETs to memory . As an application example of this technology to displays, we are currently working on the development of OLED display where Si FETs and CAAC-IGZO FETs are monolithically stacked. Our concept of such an OLED display structure is that a pixel circuit including CAAC-IGZO FETs is combined with a source driver formed with Si FETs. \nFurthermore, there is demand for higher definition than 5000 ppi.

        "title": "A Cost-Effective Fluorination Method for Enhancing the Performance ofMetal Oxide Thin-Film Transistors Using a Fluorinated Planarization Layer.txt",
        "text": "Paper 8-1 has been designated as a Distinguished Paper at Display Week 2021. The full-length version of this paper appears in a Special Section of the Journal of the Society for Information *Display (JSID)* devoted to Display Week 2021 Distinguished Papers. This Special Section will be freely accessible until December 31, 2021 via: \n4College of physics and Optoelectronic Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China 5**Institute of Microscale Optoelectronics, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China** \nThis work reports a fluorination method for metal oxide thin-film transistors through a planarization process using fluorinated polyimides. The fluorine diffusion from the planarization layer to the channels enhances device performance and reduces process thermal budget. This method is useful for the cost-effective production of active-matrix flat-panel display panels.\nAuthor Keywords Metal oxide; thin-film transistor; planarization; fluorination.\n1. Introduction\nMetal oxide (MO) thin-film transistors (TFTs) have become one of the mainstream backplane technologies in active-matrix flatpanel displays (AM-FPDs). However, their instabilities against electrical, thermal, and illumination stresses remain a critical issue. These instabilities are associated with various factors, one of which is oxygen-related deficiencies in MO channels , such as oxygen vacancies and weakly bonded oxygens. To passivate these deficiencies, thermal annealing in oxygen (O)- containing atmospheres (i.e., oxidation) is a common practice in the fabrication of MO TFTs. However, these oxidation processes are usually performed at 300 °C or higher for hours, leading to a high thermal budget. This is undesirable in the pursuit of costeffective manufacturing. Although annealing in O-rich gases, such as wet O2  and O3 , or using alternative annealing techniques, such as high pressure , microwaves , and irradiation , can reduce the thermal budget to a limited extent, the requirement of additional facility and material costs makes these solutions economically unattractive. Compared to oxidation, fluorination is a more efficient method to passivate oxygen-related deficiencies because fluorine has the largest electronegativity among all elements. In practice, fluorination is usually realized by a fluorine (F)-containing plasma treatment on MO channels . It requires extra processing steps that have to be inserted in the process flow of MO TFTs, increasing manufacturing costs and prolonging production cycles. Additionally, ion bombardments during the plasma treatment often bring about undesirable device deterioration. In this work, we develop a method to achieve fluorination of MO TFTs under mild conditions. By adopting a fluorinated polyimide (F-PI) in the planarization (PLN) process, a must-have step in the fabrication of AM-FPD panels, MO TFTs show improved electrical characteristics and stability, even when all thermal annealing steps before the PLN process were eliminated. This method is useful for the cost-effective production of AM-FPD panels and the implementation of MO TFTs on flexible substrates. \n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png) TFT with an ES layer and a PLN layer in this work. (b) Process flow of the MO TFTs in (a). The abbreviations of \"dep.\", \"pat.\", and \"sub.\" are short for deposition, patterning, and substrate, respectively. The star (*) symbol indicates an optional step in the process flow. \n2. Fabrication Processes\nAs shown in Fig. 1, the MO TFTs in this study adopt a bottomgated architecture with an etch-stop (ES) layer and a PLN layer. \nThe process flow started from 4-inch glass wafer. After wafer cleaning and SiO2 buffer layer (BL) deposition, an Al/Mo bilayer was sputtered and patterned as gate electrodes (GEs). Then, a Si3N4 (50 nm) plus SiO2 (75 nm) stack were deposited as gate insulator (GI) using plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). The equivalent oxide thickness (EOT) was 100 nm. Atop the GI stack, a layer of hybrid-phase indium tin oxide (ITO)- stabilized ZnO (50 nm) was sputtered and etched to form active channel (AC) islands. The detailed sputtering and wet etching processes are available in . After the first thermal annealing at 300 °C in air for 2 hours, the ACs were capped by a 300-nm-thick PECVD SiO2 ESL. Next, contact holes (CTs) were opened using reactive ion etching (RIE) in CHF3 plasma and covered by 150nm-thick Al pads, which served as source/drain (S/D) and gate testing pads. The devices were subjected to a second thermal annealing under the same condition as the first annealing. Lastly, a photosensitive F-PI was spin-coated on the devices, patterned by photolithography to expose the testing pads, and cured at 300 °C in air for 2 hours to form the PLN layer. For reference, we also prepared a control device with a non-fluorinated polyimide (NF-PI) PLN layer by following the above process flow. However, with no special statement, the PLN process in this paper generally refers to those steps using the F-PI. We denote the MO TFTs with the F-PI and the NF-PI PLN layer as Devices F1 and NF1, respectively. If the two annealing steps before the PLN process are removed, Devices F1 and NF1 will be further labeled as Devices F0 and NF0, respectively. The electrical characteristics of these devices were measured in a dark probe station using a semiconductor parameter analyzer (B1500, Keysight). The device surface was profiled by atomic force microscopy (AFM, Park XE150S). A time-of-flight \n8-1 / S. Deng Distinguished Paper\nsecondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS, Physical \nElectronics PHI 7200) was employed to analyze the depth profiles of elements in different devices. \n3. Results And Discussion\nFig. 2(a)-(c) show the AFM images and cross-sectional profiles of the MO TFT before and after the PLN process. The S/D-tosubstrate height difference, which is the maximum across the device, can dramatically reduce from 423 nm to 158 nm by capping the ~2-µm-thick F-PI layer. The electrical strength of the F-PI PLN layer was then examined. To avoid high-voltage measurement, the PLN layer was thinned to a half of the normal thickness (~1 µm) and sandwiched between a heavily n-type doped (N++) Si wafer and an Al pad (800 µm×400 µm). At an applied bias of 100 V, the F-PI film show a leakage current density of ~10-7 A/cm2. These results indicate that F-PI has good planarization and insulation properties and are suitable for display applications. Figure 2.

(d) I-V characteristics of the F-PI PLN layer which is sandwiched by a N++ Si wafer and an Al pad. In addition to satisfactory planarization and insulation efficacy, the PLN process also brings about performance enhancement to the MO TFTs. Fig. 3(a) shows the influence of the PLN process on the transfer curves of Device F1. With the cured F-PI layer, the device exhibits improved electrical characteristics with a positive shift of threshold voltage (Vth) from -3.3 V to -0.7 V, a decrease of subthreshold swing (SS) from 130.2 mV/decade to 80.8 mV/decade, and a rise of on-off ratio from 1.2×108 to 4.1×109. The clockwise hysteresis phenomenon observed before the PLN process almost disappears. In comparison, such a phenomenon continues with a hysteresis voltage of ~0.1 V in the control device if only the thermal curing step of the PLN process is performed. It indicates the deficiencies in the MO channel and at the GI/AC interface have not been sufficiently passivated. In other words, the PLN process is more effective in passivating deficiencies and improving device performance than conventional thermal annealing procedures. Aided by the high-efficiency PLN process, we further fabricated Device F0 with a lower thermal budget. Its process flow followed that of Device F1 but with the first and second annealing steps skipped. The transfer curve of Device F0 is plotted in Fig. 3(b). Compared to Device F1, Device F0 shows no hysteresis and has a comparable Vth and SS of -0.8 V and 81.6 mV/decade, \nrespectively. Probably due to the elimination of the additional annealing processes , the device owns relatively better S/D contacts with no current crowding effect in its output curves (Fig. \n3(c)), leading to a higher on-off ratio of 1.5×1010 and a boosted saturation mobility (µsat) of 22.3 cm2/Vs. The significant thermal budget reduction does not degrade the device uniformity in electrical performance across a large area. Fig. 3(d) plots the transfer curves of ten samples selected from the top, bottom, left, right, and center of a 4-inch glass wafer. All curves overlap well. Their µsat, Vth, and SS fluctuate in narrow ranges between 16 cm2/Vs and 23 cm2/Vs, -0.7 V and -0.9 V, and 75 mV/dec and 90 mV/dec, respectively, with relative standard deviations (RSDs) of 15.9%, 8.0%, and 5.2%, respectively.

(d) Transfer curves of ten samples of Device F0 selected from the top, bottom, left, right, and center of a 4-inch glass wafer. The inset illustrates the selected positions, and there are two samples chosen for measurement at each position. To elucidate the performance enhancement obtained by the PLN process, we analyzed the chemical composition of Devices F0 and NF0 before and after the PLN process by TOF-SIMS. The detection path starts from the PLN (if any), through the ESL and the AC, to the GI stack. All the signals are calibrated by employing the relatively stable O- signal as a reference. The depth profiles of F-, C-, Si- and ZnO- along the path are shown in Fig. \n4(a)-(d). In all devices, the distribution and concentration of most species inside the AC are similar, except for F- and C-. As a result of the PLN process using the F-PI, the signal intensity of F- and C- near the GI/AC interface of Device F0 is significantly increased by about one and two orders of magnitude, respectively. Notably, the profile of F- closely tracks that of C- across all the layers of Device F0 after the PLN process, as shown in Fig. 5(c). This strongly indicates that the increased fluorine and carbon in the AC originated from the fluorinated PLN. During the thermal curing step, fragments such as CFx radicals may be generated in the PLN \nunder heat and then diffuse through the ES, which consists of lowdensity PECVD SiO2, and eventually incorporated into the AC \n8-1 / S.

The added fluorine contents may function as efficient agents \nto passivate oxygen-related deficiencies in MO channels considering that fluorine has the largest electronegativity (3.98) among elements . The incorporated carbon has little positive impact on device performance, as evidenced in Fig. 4(d)-(f). There is also a diffusion of carbon from the non-fluorinated PLN to the AC bulk in Device NF0, but the device behaves much worse than Device F0 and Device N (i.e., the control device that only underwent the thermal curing in the PLN process). \nDevice M (i.e., Device F0 or NF0 before the PLN process), (b) Device N (i.e., Device F0 or NF0 without the covering of the PLN layer but with the thermal curing step), (c) Device F0 after the PLN process, and (d) Device NF0 after the PLN\nprocess. (e) Expanded depth profiles of F- and C- in the AC\nlayer of Devices M, N, F0, and NF0. (f) Transfer curves of Devices M, N, F0, and NF0. By virtue of the fluorination treatment on the MO channels, not only the electrical performance but also the device stability against electrical, thermal, and illumination stresses is remarkably enhanced. Fig. 5 plots the threshold voltage shifts (ΔVth) of Devices F1 and F0 as a function of stress time. Since Device F0 before the PLN process (i.e., Device M) is always short-circuited, its ΔVth result is presented together. No matter whether a positive gate bias (thermal) stress (PB(T)S, Vstress=Vth+20 V, at a temperature of 85 ℃) or a negative gate bias (illumination) stress (NB(I)S, Vstress=Vth-20 V, under white light exposure with a density of 3.6 mW/cm2) is applied to these devices, the ones after the PLN process always show a smaller ΔVth than their counterparts before the PLN process. The negative ΔVth after PB(T)S is presumably attributed to the electric-field-indued donation of extra electrons by H2O molecules and OH groups \nfrom the ESL to the AC layer . Such a degradation may fade away by further improving the quality of the ESL. Device NF0 has a smaller NBIS-induced ΔVth than Device F0 though the annealing steps before the PLN process has been deleted in its process flow for a reduced thermal budget. This is plausibly because the elimination of thermal annealing may allow more oxygen-related deficiency (such as oxygen vacancy) sites to be passivated by fluorine rather than oxygen. Since the formed metal-fluorine bonds (e.g, 516 kJ/mol or 5.327 eV for In-F) have much higher bond-dissociation energies than metal-oxygen bonds (e.g, 346 kJ/mol or 3.586 eV for In-O) , the fluorinated MO TFTs are more immune to the applied stress. These results reflect that the PLN process can be used as an efficient fluorination method to enhance device performance and stability. Different from other fluorination methods, such as F-containing plasma treatment , our method is carried out under mild conditions, so it protects the devices from processing damage, leading to a substantially steep SS. Meanwhile, there is also no need to spare extra processes for the execution of our method, simplifying the fabrication of AM-FPD panels for a shorter production cycle and a lower process thermal budget. Figure 5. Plot of PB(T)S- and NB(I)S-induced ΔVth as a function of stress time. The result of Device F0 before the PLN process is not shown here due to short circuit. \n4. Conclusion\nIn this work, we utilized a fluorinated polyimide in the final PLN process as a fluorine source for enhancing the electrical performance of bottom-gated MO TFTs without the need for additional facility costs or increased thermal budget. The underlying mechanism is attributed to the diffusion of fluorine species from the PLN layer to the AC layer and the following passivation of oxygen-related deficiencies during the thermal curing of the F-PI. By adopting the fluorinated PLN layer, bottom-gated devices exhibited significantly enhanced electrical characteristics and stability. This study provides a useful method for the cost-effective production of AM-FPD panels and the implementation of MO TFTs on flexible substrates. \n8-1 / S. Deng Distinguished Paper\n5.

        "text": "A Low-Temperature Elevated-Metal Metal-Oxide Thin-Film Transistor Technology For Flexible Electronics\nRunxiao Shi, Tengteng Lei, Sisi Wang, Zhihe Xia **And Man Wong** Department Of Electronic And Computer Engineering, **The Hong Kong University Of Science And Technology,** Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China Abstract\nA low-temperature technology based on the elevated-metal metaloxide thin-film transistor (TFT) architecture was developed for realizing electronic systems on flexible polyimide (PI) substrates. An excimer laser was used to lift-off the PI from a glass carrier substrate. The performance of the TFTs before and after the laser-lift-off exhibits insignificant difference.

As versatile active devices, transistors are popularly demanded in these systems, such as switches in a display or active circuits in a radio-frequency identification tag (1). Monolithic integration of all passive and active devices, including sensors and transistors, etc, on a flexible substrate often reduces the cost and improves the performance of the system. Due to the relatively higher field-effect mobility, lower leakage current and better reliability, metal-oxide (MO) thin-film transistors (TFTs) such as those based on indium-gallium-zinc oxide (IGZO) are promising candidates for implementing transistors in flexible electronic systems. Absent practical p-type transistors, n-type MO TFTs are predominantly deployed. Two kinds of configurations are often used to implement the pull-up device in a basic inverter circuit: a TFT (typically enhancement-mode) with connected gate and drain terminals or one (preferably depletion-mode) with connected gate and source terminals. The resulting circuits often exhibit narrow noise margins and cannot deliver full output swing from rail-to-rail. An alternative Pseudo-CMOS design methodology has been proposed (2) to address these limitations, including respectively the Pseudo-E and Pseudo-D varieties based on the diode and zerogs configurations. The need for proper sizing of the pull-up and pull-down TFTs for the first stage of a Pseudo-CMOS design limits the ability to reduce the footprint of the resulting circuit. Since most IGZO TFTs operate in the enhancement mode, the Pseudo-E variety (3) has been more popularly deployed. Implementing the elevated-metal metal-oxide (EMMO) TFT architecture (4), a low-temperature technology for realizing a flexible electronic system is presently described. Compatibility of the technology with the construction of flexible electronics is demonstrated by simulating, fabricating and characterizing a variety of digital and analog circuit building blocks. A Hybrid TFTs design methodology incorporating both depletion- and enhancement-mode TFTs enables the implementation of ratioless logic circuits. \n2. **Experimental**\nShown in Figure 1 is the schematic cross-section of an EMMO IGZO TFT implemented on a flexible polyimide (PI) substrate. \nThe construction of a TFT started with the coating of a 10-μmthick PI on a 0.5-mm-thick glass carrier substrate. A buffer layer, consisting of 200-nm-thick silicon nitride (SiNx) under 300-nmthick silicon oxide (SiOy) was deposited at 300℃ in a plasmaenhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) system. 150-nmthick molybdenum (Mo) was sputtered on the buffer layer and patterned as the bottom gate electrode. The gate dielectric consisted of a 50-nm-thick SiNx under a 75-nm-thick SiOy, both formed at 300 °C via PECVD. A 20-nm-thick IGZO active layer was then sputtered at room temperature in an atmosphere of 10% oxygen (O2) and 90% argon using an In2O3:Ga2O3:ZnO=1:1:1 target. The active island was patterned by etching in 1/2000 aqueous hydrofluoric acid solution, before a 300-nm-thick PECVD SiOy etch-stop (ES) layer was deposited.\nTFT implemented on a flexible PI substrate. The contact areas were opened in an inductively coupled plasma etcher running a sulfur hexafluoride chemistry. The source/drain (S/D) electrodes were made of sputtered and patterned stacks of 300-nm-thick aluminum (Al) on 50-nm thick Mo. The TFT was subsequently annealed at 300°C in O2 for 4 hrs. During the annealing process, the parts of the active island covered by the gas-impermeable Al-on-Mo electrodes would form the conductive S/D regions, while the part covered by the gaspermeable SiOy would become the TFT channel region. \nConsequently in an EMMO structure, the channel length was determined by the distance separating the S/D electrodes, rather than the length of the ES layer (4). Finally, a 308 nm XeCl excimer laser, with a pulse frequency of 50 Hz, an overlap of 50%\nand an energy density of 250 mJ/cm2, was irradiated through the glass substrate to lift off the TFT-carrying PI from the glass carrier. Shown in Figure 2 are photographs of the released PI substrates showing severe curling (Fig. 2a) induced by an intrinsic stress gradient. Such curling has been eliminated using a thicker but still flexible backing substrate (Fig. 2b). \nFigure 2. Photographs of (a) a PI with TFTs and circuit blocks after being lifted off from the glass carrier and (b) a PI with TFTs and circuit blocks attached to a flexible PEN film. A variety of circuits were also constructed, using the 100-nm Mo gate electrode and the 300-nm Al on 50-nm Mo S/D electrodes as the respective first and second layer of interconnects. The TFTs and the circuits were electrically characterized using an Agilent 4156C Semiconductor Parameter Analyzer, Tektronix TDS 2012C Oscilloscope and Standard Research System DS335 function generator. Circuit simulations were carried out using the EsimFPD developed by Empyrean. \n3. **Results And Discussion** (A) Emmo Igzo Tft **On Flexible Substrate**\nShown in Figure 3 are the drain current (d ) vs. gs transfer characteristics of an IGZO TFT before and after laser lift-off (LLO), exhibiting insignificant difference.\nEMMO TFT before and after the LLO. Shown in Figure 4 are the transfer characteristics of EMMO TFTs with a constant channel width  = 10 μm and channel length varying from 50 to 2 μm. A th of 0.12 V, a subthreshold swing\n() of 294 mV/dec and a field-effect mobility (FE ) of 5.8 \ncm2/Vs were extracted. With consistent th for all values of , the set of TFTs exhibits negligible effective short-channel effects. \nTFTs with W = 10 μm and L varying from 50 to 2 μm.\n(B) Basic Circuit Blocks **On Flexible Substrate**\nInverter is a basic building block for the construction of both digital and analog circuits. Starting with the basic inverter (Fig. 5a), the Pseudo-E design methodology style is adopted. With the pull-down TFTs connected respectively in parallel and in series, the basic logic functions of NOR (Fig. 5b) and NAND (Fig. 5c) were implemented. More complex combinational logic was designed and constructed, including a 2-4 decoder (Fig. 5d) and an SR latch (Fig. 5e). Basic analog circuit blocks were also implemented, including a ring oscillator (Fig. 5f), a current mirror (Fig. 5g) and a differential amplifier circuit (Fig. 5h). \n(C) Hybrid-Tfts Design Methodology\nThe diode and the zero-gs configurations for n-type MO TFTs are shown respectively in Figures 6a and 6b. It can be seen from the comparison shown in Figure 6c that the zero-gs connection can provide a higher gain due to a larger equivalent output resistance associated with the pull-up TFT T1 (5). Increasing the swing of the output (preferably rail-to-rail from DD to ) \nrequires the TFTs T1 and T2 be properly sized. Defining  ≡\n(/)T1 /(/)T2 in terms of the respective / ratios of T1 and T2,  should be smaller than 1 to pull down the low level closer to  for the diode-connected T1 and T2, while  should be greater than 1 to pull up the high level closer to DD for the zero-gs connected T1 and T2. The diode connection fundamentally suffers a th loss when the output OUT is pulled high, and the zero-gs connection would benefit from a depletion-mode pull-up TFT T1 with a sufficiently negative th to provide the required drive current. \nTwo voltage supplies are required in a Pseudo-CMOS design methodology, offering widened output swing and noise margins. \nA Pseudo-CMOS inverter consists of two stages for both PseudoE (Fig. 6d) and Pseudo-D (Fig. 6e) designs, with the first stage inheriting the ratioed design requirement of  < 1 for the former and  > 1 for the latter. For compensating the th loss of the basic inverter design, the supply voltage SS for the first stage is made larger than the DD for the second stage.\nanal, 24 , 258 [1000/90/91] no variable animO voliW ,\nThe high-level noise margin can be defined as the increase in IN needed to induce a decrease in OUT from DD to 0.9DD. When IN applied to a Pseudo-CMOS inverter is increased from , SS enables the gate of T3 to maintain a voltage much higher than IN over a wider range of increasing IN. Consequently, OUT can be maintained at a high level over the same range, thereby widening the noise margin.\nTo overcome the limitations of the area-consuming ratioed design methodology, both depletion- and enhancement-mode TFTs are used in a Hybrid-TFTs design methodology. This alternative methodology uses the zero-gs connection to obtain a higher gain. \nInstead of the  > 1 required by an enhancement-mode pull-up T1, a depletion-mode T1 with a properly adjusted negative th allows the deployment of T1 and T2 with similar dimensions. In principle, the needed th adjustment can be realized by selective fluorination (6), a different choice of semiconducting MO (7), or a dual-gate architecture (8). The design philosophies of Hybrid-E and Hybrid-D are similar, except that Hybrid-E turns the enhancement-mode T1 into a depletion-mode TFT whereas Hybrid-D turns the depletion-mode T2 into an enhancement-mode TFT. Since the source voltage of T2 is constant in Hybrid-D, a dual-gate device can be used to adjust the th. The same approach cannot be applied to T1 of Hybrid-E. The advantages this design methodology can be seen in Figure 6i, offering higher gain, wider noise margin, fuller swing and ratio-less design. Illustrating the Hybrid-E design methodology, NOR (Fig. 7a) and NAND (Fig. 7b) gates have been designed. \n4. **Conclusion**\nPresently demonstrated is a low-temperature technology based on the EMMO TFT architecture for flexible electronic systems. Insignificant change in the performance of TFTs was observed before and after their laser lift-off from the glass carrier substrate. The TFTs of different channel lengths did not exhibit obvious effective short-channel effects. A variety of digital and analog circuit building blocks were simulated, fabricated and characterized. Finally, a Hybrid-TFTs design style has been studied, employing both depletion- and enhancement-mode TFTs in one circuit. This alternative design methodology enjoys the advantages of ratio-less, high gain, wide noise margins and full logic swing. \nAdvanced Displays and Optoelectronics Technologies under \n![3_image_0.png](3_image_0.png) Grant ITC-PSKL12EG02 and Grant SGDX2019081623360954 from Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Committee.

This attribute is meaningful to those devices with battery powered. Such as sports watch, electronic tag and so on. To achieve the low power consumption target, many methods can be used. On one side, use low resistivity metal materials or increase the metal thickness. On the other side, use low dielectric coefficient insulation layers or thick organic coating to decrease the parasitic capacity. Also we can use special thin film transistor to reduce the TFT's parasitic capacity or use high mobility semiconductor materials to resize the TFT dimension. Reduce the driving frequency is also a good method to lower the power consumption. Driving LCD with low frequency has many difficulties. The one is human eyes may be more sensitivities to brightness variations in low frequency which can cause flicker problems. The other is imaging sticking may deterioration. Also TFT reliability can be worsen lead to reliability problems. IGZO for its insensitivity to temperature, adequate mobility and low leakage current is suitable for low frequency driving devices. We fabricate a transflective TFT-LCD device based on IGZO TFT. It can driving in 1Hz to 60Hz alternatively and has 256 gray scale image.\n2. Basic Information Of The **Lcd Device**\nFigure 1 shows a schematic of the device. With a round active area(AA). GIP circuit is designed on the left and right of AA. The demux circuit is placed on the bottom of AA. The resolution is 240RGB*240 and the AA size is 1.2 inch. The demux is 1:6 designed which is 1 IC output pad corresponding with 6 sources in AA. Using GIP and demux we can reduce the border of LCD and driving in low frequency can reduce the power consumption, so its meaningful to verify whether the GIP and demux circuit performance well in low frequency, high temperature and high humidity condition. \nWe use bottom gate IGZO TFT to make the transflective TFTLCD. In order to enlarge the reflective area, com electrode or \npixel electrode was placed right above the IGZO TFT. This can deteriorate the TFT performance especially the reliability performance. So the film forming process is improved to minimize the impact imposed by the electrode above the TFT. We use some methods to improve the GIP performance especially the reliability performance. The source loading was well designed to suitable for the demux driving condition. Also the materials used in LCD cell is carefully choosed.\ntransmissive mode Figure 2 shows 8 samples was tested to see the flicker performance. The flicker is tested in flicker image. We use DMS to check the flicker in reflective mode and use CA310 to test the flicker in transmissive mode. The driving frequency is 1Hz in reflective mode while 60Hz in transmissive mode. In reflective mode the backlight is power off and the backlight is power on in transmissive mode. The flicker is smaller than -60dB in reflective mode and smaller than -50dB in transmissve. According to the tested value of flicker we can see the transflective TFT-LCD performance well both in 1Hz mode and in 60Hz mode. \n| flicker after RA test(dB)                                                                                              |               |                  |       |       |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|------------------|-------|-------|\n| RA test conditon                                                                                                       | 70°C,240H,    | 60°C /90RH,240H, |       |       |\n| operation,1Hz                                                                                                          | operation,1Hz |                  |       |       |\n| sample 1&2                                                                                                             | -59.27        | -47.65           |       |       |\n| sample 3&4                                                                                                             | -47.8         | -55.15           |       |       |\n| sample 5&6                                                                                                             | -51.2         | -53.14           |       |       |\n| sample 7&8                                                                                                             | -61.89        | -52.18           |       |       |\n| sample 9&10                                                                                                            | -58.74        | -53.41           |       |       |\n| sample 11&12                                                                                                           | -47.09        | -56.55           |       |       |\n| Sample1 13&14                                                                                                          | -51.42        | -51.09           |       |       |\n| sample 15&16                                                                                                           | -62.34        | -49.79           |       |       |\n| Table 3.

The reflective mode and the transmissive mode were tested respectively. The total tested time is 240 hours for each RA test condition. In reflective mode the driving frequency is 1Hz and the backlight is power off. In transmissive mode the driving frequency is 60Hz and the backlight is power on. In storage RA test condition and the thermal shock RA test condition, the LCD is power off. The RA test results show that after 240H RA test, the LCD remains performance well.\nhours RA test in 1Hz driving frequency\nflicker after RA test(dB)\nvoltage bias applied on the TFT in 1Hz driving mode. So we tested the 1Hz reflective mode samples after RA test to see if it is deteriation. Table 2 shows the flicker after RA condition \"70°C, 240H, operation, 1Hz\" and \"60°C/90RH, 240H, operation, 1Hz\". We tested 8 samples separately for each condition. We can see that the LCD performance well even after 240 hours RA test for the flicker is below than -47dB after 70°C RA condition and 60°C/90RH RA condition. The flicker is almost the same as the LCD without RA test. This indicates the transflective LCD device we fabricated based on IGZO is reliable enough to long term use. Table 3 shows the contrast ratio value of the device in reflective mode and the transmissive mode. The value is acquired by DMS in reflective mode and SR-3A in transmissive mode. The contrast ratio is beyond 23 in reflective mode while 29 in transmissive mode. The contrast ratio is enough for human read information on the LCD under sunshine or in the dark environment. \nTable 4 shows the imaging sticking performance in reflective mode. We tested 2 samples and check the imaging sticking performance immediately after 1, 2, 4, 8, 24 hours. Release 30min in the table 4 means we closed the LCD power 30 minutes. The imaging sticking pattern is chess pattern.

Level 1 means no image sticking under vertical viewing angle. Level 2 means slightly image sticking under vertical viewing angle. Level 3 means LCD has image sticking problem and the image sticking boundary is unsharpness. Level 2.5 means the imaging sticking performance is between level 2 and level 3. We checked the imaging sticking after 1 hour, 2 hour, 4 hour, 8 hour and 24 hour. Although in the worst case is the imaging sticking level can reaches level 2.5, but after release 30min the imaging sticking can't be seen by human eyes in any viewing angle. Figure 3 shows the screen refresh problem which often occurs in low frequency driving condition such as driving frequency is 1Hz, because the brightness of the positive frame is different from the negative frame for the cause of charge ratio, the hold ratio or the voltage is different form positive frame to negative frame. And in 1Hz frame rate the human is more sensitivity to brightness, so the screen refresh problem occurs. Figure 3(a) shows the positive frame. Figure 3(b) shows the negative frame is refreshed 1/3 image. Figure 3(c) shows the negative frame is refreshed 2/3 image. Figure 3(d) shows the negative frame image. If there are screen refresh problem or not is one of the key factor to evaluate the LCD device while driving in low frequency. By means of improve the film process, enlarge the capacity and choose the right cell materials, we finally fabricated the transflective TFT-LCD device with no screen refresh problem in all grey images from 0 grey to 255 grey even after RA test. \n| Frequency                                                | Black   | White   | R/G/B   | Grey   | Flicker   | Crosstalk   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|--------|-----------|-------------|\n| \\Image                                                   | (mW)    | (mW)    | (mW)    | (mW)   | (mW)      | (mW)        |\n| 1Hz                                                      | 34.28   | 33.66   | 34.64   | 33.86  | 34.19     | 33.85       |\n| 5Hz                                                      | 35.51   | 35.24   | 36.17   | 35.73  | 35.69     | 35.55       |\n| 60Hz                                                     | 54.34   | 56.18   | 56.16   | 60.17  | 57.37     | 58.91       |\n| Table 5 shows the power consumption of the demo with GIP |         |         |         |        |           |             |\nTable 5 shows the power consumption of the demo with GIP and demux circuit. The power consumption in 1Hz driving frequency is reduced by 36.9%~42.5% in contrast to 60Hz. The power consumption in 5Hz driving frequency is reduced by 34.7%~39.7% in contrast to 60Hz. Although the absolute power consumption is high, we due this to the IC is not well designed for our panel. Such as the IC's minimum supported resolution is 720P, but our LCD's resolution is 240P. We insert dummy black image to let the LCD shows 240P image. Meanwhile the IC is not well designed for low frequency driving condition, we assume that if IC is well designed for low frequency, the power consumption in 1Hz can be reduced 80% in contrast to 60Hz. In order to confirm our guess, we fabricated a pin to pin designed transflective LCD based on IGZO TFT that is without GIP and demux. Pin to pin design means the gates and sources in LCD were directly connected one by one to the IC. The IC is well designed for low frequency driving. We tested the average power consumption reduced by 87% in 1Hz in contrast to 51Hz. The absolute power consumption in white image is 2mW in 51Hz mode while 0.26mW in 1Hz mode. Figure 4 shows the Demo that is pin to pin designed based on IGZO TFT. Figure 5 shows the image of the Transflective TFT-LCD with GIP and demux circuit.

So you can see yellow border on the left and right side of \n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png) the LCD where there is no BM(black matric) and PS(photo spacer). But it has no influence with the conclusion of the evaluation of our transflective TFT-LCD. \n4. **Conclusion**\nWe fabricated a transflective TFT-LCD based on IGZO TFT. GIP and Demux were integrated in the LCD. The device can operate in 1Hz or 60Hz alternatively. The tested results prohibit that the device can provide a good quality both in low frequency and in high frequency."

The backplane has excellent electrical performance and reliability, which can meet the requirements of flexible display devices.\nTop gate IGZO; AMOLED display; Flexible display; Reliability 1. **Introduction**\nThe way we use electronic devices has been changed by flexible electronics. In futuristic applications such as mobile health, wearable applications and smart home, manufacturing portable devices with flexible display that can be bent and rolled has become a trend . Active matrix organic light-emitting diode (AMOLED) displays have attracted the attention of display industry due to their advantages of light weight, fast response time, high contrast and low power consumption , and for large OLEDs the amorphous InGaZnO (a-IGZO) thin film transistor is considered as the next generation of flexible backplane technology due to its high mobility, good uniformity, low offstate current and low process temperature . However, the reliability of a-IGZO TFT with OLED flexible encapsulation material is inferior at high temperature, which is speculated that the downward diffusion of H in flexible encapsulation materials leads to the threshold voltage drifting to negative. Solving this problem is imminent, which is one of the keys to the application of a-IGZO thin-film transistors for flexible OLED products. In this paper, we successfully prepared a self-aligned top-gate IGZO thin film transistor backplane for flexible AMOLED display with a layer of metal oxide (MOX) that can effectively block H. The backplane has excellent electrical performance and reliability, which can meet the requirements of flexible display devices.\n2. Experimental Process\nFirst of all, different materials which can block H were evaluated to identify certain materials that can be applied to the TFT device structure, and the MOX material was finally selected from the aspects of process, structure, preparation method and cost. After preparing the MOX film, the MOX material was tested for H shielding performance, we deposited SIN films on the G4.5 substrate, then the MOX film layer was deposited on one of the two SIN films, the TDS tests of the two SIN films were carried out, and the amount of H desorption was observed at different temperatures, the results indicated the structure with MOX film layer showed less amount of H desorption, and the amount of H desorption without MOX film was more, also it was found through calculation that H shielding ratio of the MOX layer can be more than 90% at 300℃. Based on this result, an a-IGZO TFT \nbackplane with a self-aligned top gate structure was fabricated on Gen.4.5 substrate. The cross-sectional diagram is demonstrated in Fig.1. A light-shielding Cu layer (LS) was first deposited on the substrate to protect the IGZO active layer from external illumination. To prevent the influence of oxygen and water vapor, buffer layer was deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). Then a-IGZO active layer was sputtered with inline sputter equipment, and patterned by mask exposure and wet etching process. Next, a gate insulating (GI) layer and a gate electrode layer (M1) were deposited and patterned through mask exposure and wet etching to form a self-aligned structure. Plasma treatment was applied for n+ IGZO S/D ohmic contact. After that, the interlayer dielectric (ILD) layer with MOX and source/drain layer (M2) were deposited and patterned to form a top gate structure. Then, a passivation (PV) layer was deposited and patterned by via hole etching. Finally, we used the IJP process to complete the IGZO top gate AMOLD product. The dimension of TFTs studied in this work are all the same size of W/L=10μm/8μm.\n3. Experimental Results 3.1. The H Desorption Performance Of The Sin With Mox (Tds Test)\nSIN was deposited on two G4.5 substrates, followed by the MOX film layer deposition on one of the SIN films, and then the TDS test was carried out to observe the amount of H desorption at different temperatures. As indicated in Figure 2(a), the structure with the MOX film layer had less H desorption, while the structure without MOX showed an opposite result. It was found that H shielding ratio of the MOX layer can be more than 90% at 300℃ through calculation, as shown in Figure 2(b);\nFig. 2. (a) H desorption vs. temperature, the structure had less H desorption with the MOX film layer.(b) H shielding ratio, the ratio can be more than 90% at 300℃ through calculation with the MOX layer.\n3.2. The Electrical Performance Of The Top Gate Igzo Tft With Mox Layer\nThe top gate self-alignment TFT was fabricated on the G4.5 substrate, the MOX film layer was added before the ILD layer deposition in the TFT, and the electrical test was carried out after the completion of the array backplane. The transfer characteristics of top-gate self-aligned a-IGZO TFTs which prepared with or without MOX layer are shown in Fig.3 (a) and (b), the devices with MOX layer exhibit good performance, for example, the field-effect mobility was 15.00cm2/Vs, threshold voltage (Vth) \nwas 0.59V, subthreshold swing (SS) was 0.14V/dec, indicating that the introduction of MOX layer has negligible impact on the electrical properties of a-IGZO TFT.\n3.3. Reliability Of Top Gate Igzo Tfts With Mox\nReliability of the TFT is an important parameter for display because it directly affects the reliability of the panel. In order to study the reliability of TFTs with MOX, we measured long-term positive bias temperature stress (PBTS) and negative bias temperature illumination stress (NBTiS). The PBTS test was measured under dark environment at Vg = 30V, 60 ˚С for 1 hour, while the NBTiS test was measured under 4500 nits white light intensity at Vg = -30 V, 60 ˚С for 1 hour. Fig. 4(a) and (b) show the PBTS and NBTiS results, respectively. The PBTS shift and NBTiS shift under 1 hour stress are only 0.51 V and -0.32 V, respectively.\n![1_image_1.png](1_image_1.png) \nInitial 3600s VD=10V\nFlexible TFE was fabricated on IGZO top gate TFT TEG device \n![1_image_2.png](1_image_2.png) with and without MOX layer, the H content of this TFE is higher, the finished TEGs were then verified at high temperature storage (80 °C). With the increase of storage time, the Vths of TFT devices without MOX film had a large negative shift, while the Vths of TFT devices with MOX film had a small negative shift, as shown in Fig.5.\n3.4. A 31-Inch Oled Display Driven By The Backplane With Mox\nWe successfully demonstrated a 31-inch OLED display driven by \n![1_image_4.png](1_image_4.png) the backplane with MOX produced in the G4.5 facilities. As shown in Fig. 6, the panel had no obvious point and line defects for module-lighting after bonding process, the display quality is excellent with no obvious picture defect.\n3.5. The Reliability Of A-Igzo Top Gate Amoled Panel With Mox\nIn order to further verify its reliability, the operated panel was placed in a high temperature environment (60℃) and its electrical properties were monitored, the results in Fig.7 (a) and (b) show the Vth shifts of the panel without MOX layer and with MOX \nlayer after 1500 hours. The △Vth of the a-IGZO Top Gate AMOLED panel without MOX shifted to the negative direction\n(-2.5V) and the △Vth of the a-IGZO Top Gate AMOLED panel with MOX shifted to the positive direction(+0.67V) after 1500 ![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)\ntemperature reliability of 31-inch panel of a-IGZO TFT backplane with MOX layer (The Vth compensation range: -\n1.15~3.25V)\n4. Conclusion\nIn this paper, we demonstrated that MOX has good H shielding ratio which can improve the stability of a-IGZO top gate AMOLED flexible panel. First, the H shielding ratio of MOX was studied by TDS test, and the H shielding ratio was calculated to be more than 90% at 300 °C. Then we applied the MOX to aIGZO top gate TFT, the electrical performance change was small, The PBTS and NBTiS shift under 1 hour stress were only 0.51 V and -0.32 V, respectively. Next the TFT fabricated with MOX film was combined with flexible TFE for high-temperature storage verification, and the Vth shifts were within specifications, while the Vth of TFT without MOX shifted to a more negative direction . Finally, a flexible panel with MOX was produced, and after the high-temperature operational reliability verification for 1500hrs, the Vth shift was small and the reliability of a-IGZO top gate AMOLED panel with MOX was greatly improved compared with panel without the MOX layer."

Top-gate a-IGZO has the following advantages over staggered bottom gate a-IGZO. By reducing the parasitic capacitance and the resulting S/D overlap, the resistance-capacitance (RC) can be reduced. Inhibiting the RC delay can reduce the thickness of the gate insulator (GI); therefore, the gate will offer better control. The S/D contact in IGZO can reduce the a-IGZO bulk series resistance of the bottom gate , . However, the gate driver on array (GOA) circuit on the display's narrow border and the transistor that drives the OLED must have high current operation –. To further raise the on current, the channel width/length ratio should be increased . As the channel width increases, heat dissipation in TFTs becomes more difficult. In addition, because the thermal conductivity of a-IGZO is much lower than that of Si, heat dissipation of a-IGZO to the Si base material is relatively difficult . High-voltage self-heating stress (SHS) operation will produce Joule heating and degradation.\nIn this study, an abnormal threshold voltage shift toward the negative direction and a hump effect are observed, unlike that found in conventional SHS conditions . Because the top-gate a-IGZO uses hydrogen doping to define the S/D in the device, the Joule heat in the channel under a high current causes hydrogen diffusion of n+ IGZO in the S/D. Hydrogen diffusion will cause a rise in the Fermi-level, which leads to barrier lowering in the main channel and a resultant VTH shift to the left –. However, although the role of hydrogen is generally understood as that of a shallow donor, generating free carriers in IGZO, Nomura *et al.* showed that hydrogen does not increase IGZO conductivity because the free electrons caused by hydrogen diffusion are compensated for by the excess oxygen, which tends to capture electrons to form O−/O2− ions .\nCOMSOL heat simulation is also performed in this study, and a physical model mechanism proposed to clarify the generation of the hump effect. Further, to counter the thermal effect in a channel of large width, a partitioning method is used to divide the channel into smaller sections. Clarifying this degradation phenomenon will aid the design of better high current dual-gate a-IGZO structures.\nThe n-type a-IGZO TFTs used in the experiment were prepared with top-gate structure which were fabricated on a glass substrate. First, a 50-nm-thick a-IGZO active layer was deposited by a DC-type sputtering system with an atomic molar ratio target of In2O3:Ga2O3:ZnO = 1:1:1 at room 0741-3106 © 2019 IEEE.

Next, a SiOX film with thickness of 140-nm was deposited on the a-IGZO using plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) to act as the gate insulator. Then Ti/Al/Mo (30/200/50 nm) film was deposited by sputtering an argon ion bombardment, and the Mo and Al layers were wetetched. Then, inductively-coupled plasma (ICP) dry-etched Ti was used to form the gate electrode, and a gate insulator layer was patterned using ICP, which was followed by a 400nm-thick SiOx interlayer dielectric layer (ILD) deposited by PECVD. An additional benefit of using silane hydrogen doping during the ILD process is that it can also define the n+ IGZO source/drain in the top gate a-IGZO . Next, ILD was wet etched to form the via. The via-contact-type n+ IGZO source and drain (S/D) electrodes of Ti/Al/Ti (30/200/50 nm) were formed by sequential sputtering deposition and were then wet-etch patterned. Finally, the device 300-nm thick SiOx passivation layer (PV) was deposited by PECVD. The potential operations under top-gate a-IGZO SHS (VG = 30 V, VD =\n15 V, VS = 0 V) are shown in Fig. 1(a). The electrical properties of the top-gate a-IGZO TFTs were analyzed using an Agilent B1500A semiconductor parameter analyzer and a Cascade M150 microprobe station. In this work, the main and sub channel threshold voltages (VTH) were defined as the gate voltage (VG) when NID reached 1 nA and 500 nA in the linear region, respectively.\nIii. Results And Discussion\nIn previous studies, the degradation of the self-heating effect resulted in the threshold voltage shift. The shift toward the positive direction occurs because the electrons are trapped in the insulating layer owing to the operation in the vertical electric field . However, from PBS measurements, an insignificant degradation is apparent. In general, after PBS, the threshold voltages of TFTs are accompanied by a positive shift caused by electron trapping at the channel/dielectric interface. The experimental results in Fig. 1(b), which show only a negligible shift in threshold voltage, indicate a superior quality gate insulating layer, which avoids the degradation. The channel width and length are 30 µm and 4 µm, respectively; the ID − VG curves are relative to the applied stress versus time for the a-IGZO TFT before and after gate bias stress, with bias stress conditions of VG = 30 V and VDS = 0 V for 2000 s. There is no threshold voltage shift after the stress, which suggests that the insulation layer does not have any electron trapping, for VG up to 30 V. This also reveals the good quality of the insulation layer, as shown in Fig. 1(b). However, in top-gate a-IGZO SHS, the ID − VG curves are relative to the applied stress versus time for the a-IGZO TFT before and after gate bias stress, with bias stress conditions of VG = 30 V\nand VDS = 15 V for 2000 s. VTH shifts toward the left, and an abnormal hump in electrical characteristics is observed. Next, after being subjected to stress for 1000 s, the TFT exhibits a normally-on electrical characteristic, which is different from the conventional SHS electronic trapping. Even after a static 24 hour recovery, the electrical characteristics cannot recover after the 1000 s stress, as shown in Fig. 1(c).\nTo further investigate the hump degradation behavior under SHS, several analyses were conducted. The hump effect is caused by dual-channel elements, possibly due to the side channel and punch-through (back-channel) mechanism –. Therefore, in the experimental design, the hump effect generated by the double gate after the SHS\nis used; negative bias is applied to the bottom gate to forcibly close the back channel to eliminate the punch-through effect, as shown in Fig. 2(a). Fig. 2 (b) shows the dual-gate hump effect ID − VG characteristic transfer curves with gate voltage sweeping for VD = 0.1 V at bottom gate voltages of −15, 0, and 15 V. When negative bias is applied to the bottom gate, a hump effect still occurs. Hence, the punch-through effect between the dual-channel can be eliminated as a factor. Next, in the COMSOL Joule heat simulation, SHS is applied to the top-gate a-IGZO. Because the S/D is n+ IGZO, the channel is IGZO, and it is more difficult for IGZO to dissipate heat than it is for metal, hydrogen diffusion occurs by Joule heating under high current operation. Otherwise, hydrogen diffusion will cause a rise in the Fermi-level, which leads to barrier lowering in the main channel and a consequent VTH shift to the left. Next, the unequal channel thermal effect causes hydrogen in S/D to diffuse into the channel, resulting in the hump effect and VTH shift toward the negative direction, as shown in Fig. 2(c). The accumulated Joule heat at the center channel is the most apparent, and the hydrogen diffusion is more prominent at the center of the channel. Therefore, the main-channel conduction occurs at low voltage in the central channel, and the increased heat dissipation in both side channels leads to less hydrogen diffusion; therefore, the subchannel conducts later than does the main channel, as shown in Fig. 2(d).\nIn addition, it can be observed that as the SHS time evolves, the current of the main channel will increase over time (which means that both the ratio of hydrogen diffusion and Joule heat accumulation to the occupied channel width will increase), and the Joule heat will accumulate at the inside of the channel during the SHS operation. The central part accumulates heat slowly (the side will preferentially dissipate heat). With the evolution of the SHS operation time, the Fermi-level rises in the channel due to hydrogen diffusion, and the threshold voltage shifts with the fixed gate voltage (30 V). The difference between the threshold voltage and gate voltage becomes larger, and the current increases. In the SHS, the Joule heat of the channel gradually increases along the width of the channel as the operating time increases, which results in the ratio of the main channel increasing. The main channel and sub-channel\nconstitute the overall current. After the hydrogen diffuses into the channel, the overall current is observed to rise.\nFigure 2(e) shows the central source-IGZO-drain lateral energy band. The central channel increases the Fermi energy owing to the Joule heat; therefore, the main channel produces a smaller barrier and leads to earlier conduction. While the side channel source-IGZO-drain lateral energy band exhibits a smaller Joule heating effect, hydrogen diffusion is less significant; therefore, the barrier is higher. Hence, the VTH\nof the sub-channel is larger than that of the main channel, and the main channel conducts at a lower voltage. As the gate voltage gradually increases, the sub-channel begins to conduct, as shown in Fig. 2(f).\nIn previous studies, the self-heating effect strongly depends on the channel width, because Joule heating is more difficult to dissipate over a larger channel width. Fig. 3(a) shows a fixed channel length of 4 µm, and a small channel width of 10 µm.\nThe left shift of the SHS threshold voltage is less than those found at larger widths. Next, as the channel width becomes larger (20 µm and 30 µm), the Joule heat effect becomes more significant, and hydrogen in the n+IGZO diffuses more into the channel, thus causing the hump effect in Fig. 3(b) and Fig. 1(c). It becomes more difficult for the heat to dissipate to the sides of the channel as the width becomes larger, because the S/D is composed of n+ IGZO. The heat depends solely on the heat dissipation from both sides of the width edge of the channel as the width increases, as shown in the heat dissipation diagram of Fig. 3(c), (d), (e).\nHowever, the design of the device can accommodate drive circuits of higher current. The channel width can induce the ID to exhibit better output characteristics, and the Joule thermal stacking effect that occurs at increased widths, can be avoided. This can be accomplished by partitioning the channel width in the structure. In the COMSOL simulation, Joule heat accumulation in the channel can be effectively controlled when the channel is split into two and three parts of equal widths,\nFig. 4.

Fig. 4(b) illustrates the device with a total channel width of 30 µm, length of 4 µm, and the width of each channel partition of 10 µm. Fig. 4(c) shows the ID −VG\ncharacteristic transfer curves at the initial state and after stress with VG = 30 V, VD = 15 V, and a grounded source/drain for 2000 s. The result indicates that no hydrogen diffusion is caused by Joule heating after application of stress.\nThe degradation behavior induced by the self-heating effect in top-gate a-IGZO TFTs has been investigated in this work.\nThe instability of VTH is clearly caused by the self-heating effect. Hydrogen diffusion in the source/drain n+ IGZO\nleads to a VTH shift and causes an unrecoverable permanent degradation in the electrical characteristics. In the COMSOL\nsimulation, the Joule heating effect causes more hydrogen diffusion in the central channel than in the side channel. Owing to this hydrogen diffusion, different Fermi levels in the main and side channels cause the hump effect. With wider main and side channels, the self-heating effect becomes more evident and is not beneficial for a practical drive circuit.\nThese results indicate that when the VTH shifts to the left, the voltage across the drive device increases, causing reliability issues. To address this issue, the structure is partitioned into equal width sections for heat dissipation under high current operation. This work will contribute to realizing future topgate and dual-gate a-IGZOs in drive circuit design."

        "text": "A Review On The Recent Advancements In Tin Oxide-Based Thin-Film Transistors For Large-Area Electronics\nK. JENIFER,1 S. ARULKUMAR,1 S. PARTHIBAN ,\nKey words: Metal oxide semiconductors, thin-film transistors, amorphous oxide semiconductor, tin oxide, sputtering\nThe advances in conventional thin-film transistors (TFT) have played a major role in the development of the electronics industry. However, the growing demand for electronics and optoelectronics with updated features, such as high carrier mobility, ultrahigh resolution, fast response, transparency, and flexibility, requires the enhancement of existing materials and the development of new ones to be used as active channel layer for TFTs.\nDespite the high carrier mobility (> 80 cm2/V s) of conventional crystalline and polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si)-based TFTs, their several limitations, such as high processing temperature, need for laser processing and low band gap (1.1 eV), restrict their use in large-area applications.1–3 In addition, their high processing temperature (> 450C) and rigidity limits their application in flexible substrates, whereas the grain boundaries in poly-Si TFTs create non-uniformities that lead to carrier mobility variation and change in the response time, resulting in significant changes in image visualization, which is undesirable in display devices since each pixel is controlled by an individual TFT.2 Investigations of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) and organic TFTs helped in overcoming these drawbacks. The a-Si:H TFTs provide a high level of device uniformity; however, their carrier mobility\n(- 0.5–1 cm2/V s) is three orders of magnitude lower than that of crystalline silicon TFTs\n(- 100 cm2/V s) owing to the deterioration in the carrier transport path. Moreover, the switching\n(Received August 1, 2020; accepted September 26, 2020) speed of a-Si:H TFTs is relatively very low, and the deteriorations in the electrical properties of aSi:H TFTs caused by the photo-illumination sensitivity affect device stability.4 Organic TFTs are inexpensive compared to a-Si:H TFTs and can be fabricated at low temperature. However, they suffer from low carrier mobility and inferior potential bias stability, which limits their application in display devices.1 TFTs based on metal oxide semiconductors have gained considerable attention in the past few decades. They offer a promising solution for nextgeneration flat-panel displays (FPD) due to several advantages, such as high carrier mobility, low process temperature, wide variety of chemical composition, control of carrier density, compatibility with a wide range of substrates, and high transparency.5–10 Compared with crystalline metal oxide semiconductors, the structure of amorphous oxide semiconductors (AOS) is extremely sensitive to deposition conditions, stoichiometry, and composition. This results in high uniformity, as well as tuneable optical and electrical properties, which are the key factors for display applications.8–10 In particular, transparent amorphous oxide semiconductors (TAOS) offer impressive features comparable to crystalline semiconductors (c-SC), such as very high carrier mobility (> 10–50 cm2/V s).11 Other advantages of TAOS include low-temperature fabrication, ionic bonding, and wide-range tunability of electrical and optical properties.5 The display market forecast conducted by MarketsandMarkets in 2017 indicated that the transparent display market would grow from USD 408 million (in 2018) to USD 2591 million (in 2023), reaching the highest compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 44.7%,12 which confirms the promising future of TAOS in next-generation transparent display devices.\nThe introduction of Hosono's hypothesis in 1996 resulted in considerable research activity in AOS\nTFTs with multiple post-transition metal cations, such as indium, zinc, tin, and gallium. According to this hypothesis, metal oxides composed of heavy metal cations with an electronic configuration of\n(n  1) d10ns0 (n ‡ 4) have remarkable transparency and carrier mobility in the amorphous state due to the overlapping of the ns orbitals\n(where n is the principal quantum number).13 Nomura et al. explained this by the carrier transport path of covalent semiconductors, which is composed of strong directional sp3 orbitals.14 Therefore, any structural disorder can introduce variations in the electronic levels, resulting in low mobility. However, in AOS, the contribution of oxygen 2p orbitals in bonding is small, and hence there is a high possibility for direct overlapping of neighbouring metal ns orbitals, even in the amorphous phase, which results in high mobility.14 The majority of AOS TFTs reported to date have employed zinc oxide (ZnO)- and indium oxide\n(In2O3)-based materials as active channel materials.\nIn particular, indium-gallium-zinc oxide (IGZO)\nTFTs have been widely used due to their high carrier mobilities (- 10 cm2/V s) and high current ON/OFF ratios (approximately ION/IOFF > 107).5,6 Since the introduction of IGZO by Nomura et al. in 2004, research on IGZO has increased significantly. Since 2012, IGZO has been commercially used by leading FPD companies such as Sharp, LG, Razer, and Samsung.8 However, indium is a scarce element, and its presence in the earth's crust is only 0.25 ppm. Thus, the expected depletion of indium represents a threat to FPD devices based on IGZO. A recent survey forecasted that the indium market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 9.5% between 2017 and 2024, which can cause tremendous rise in its price.15 Moreover, a-IGZO TFTs have been reported to show instability under photo-illumination conditions, which remarkably shifts the threshold voltage and leads to negative bias stress instability.9 Gallium in a-IGZO is acid-soluble and sensitive to wet etching, which leads to damage of the back-channel surface during photolithography processes.16 Likewise, Zn is assumed to cause instability of the device performance since it forms weak bonds with the oxygen ions in ternary structure.17,18 Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of In- and Zn-free TAOS\nmaterial to address the above-mentioned issues, meanwhile offering better electrical and optical properties.\nTin (Sn) is an abundant metal in the earth's crust, resulting in its being less expensive ($15.203/kg)\ncompared to indium (In) (- $750/kg).19 The dual valency of tin (group 14) with +2 and +4 oxidation states causes tin oxide to exist in two stable states, i.e., tin monoxide (SnO) and tin dioxide (SnO2),\nrespectively. This enhances the wide-range tunability of electrical properties of the device. The electronic configuration of Sn4+ (4d105s2) is similar to that of In3+ (4d105s 0).20 The band structure of tin oxide (SnOx) is similar to indium oxide, and the high bonding dissociation energy of Sn4+ is higher (SnO - 531.8 kJ/mol) than that of In3+ (In-O - 320.1 kJ/mol), Ga3+ (Ga-O - 353.5 kJ/mol), and Zn2+(ZnO - 284.1 kJ/mol).21 Tin oxide is an intensively studied oxide material because it offers both high transparency and conductivity, which makes it unique among the elements of group 14. Moreover, SnOx can provide both n-type and p-type conductivities by tuning the deposition conditions. Hence, SnOx could be an alternative to IGZO to replace In and Zn in TFTs. This review tackles the development and characteristics of indium and zinc-free tin oxide (SnOx)-based TAOS thin films as active channel materials in TFTs for FPD and complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) device applications.\nJenifer, Arulkumar, Parthiban, and Kwon A Review on the Recent Advancements in Tin Oxide-Based Thin-Film Transistors for LargeArea Electronics\nHistorical Perspective Of Tin Oxide Tfts\nThe concept of metal oxide semiconductor transistors emerged in the early 1930s. However, due to the lack of progress in vacuum technologies, it was not until the mid-1960s that a practical demonstration was achieved. In 1964, Klasens and Koelmans reported a tin dioxide-based TFT, as the first transparent oxide TFT.22 In 1970, Aoki et al.\nreported a SnO2 TFT, which exhibited poor electrical performance, including the negligible transfer curve and inability to turn off the device.23 Both these TFTs showed transconductance of 0.3 m mho.\nUntil 1996, no major works on tin oxide TFTs were published, which may be attributed to the emergence of a-Si-, poly-Si-, and organic semiconductorbased TFTs and to the poor electrical performance of the early tin oxide-based TFTs. In 1996, Prins et al. reported antimony-doped SnO2 as a channel layer in transparent ferroelectric transistors.24 The authors mentioned that they fabricated a fully transparent all-oxide TFT, which is noteworthy. Nevertheless, the TFT suffered from low switching\n(ION/IOFF - 102) with a mobility of 5 cm2/V s. In 2003, Wo¨llenstein et al. employed a SnO2 TFT in a novel gas sensor device, which was an initiative for the SnOx TFT-based gas sensors.25 In 2004, Presley et al.26 fabricated an amorphous SnO2 TFT with a carrier mobility of 0.8 cm2/V s and ION/IOFF ratio of about 105. They reported that their device required very large turn-off voltage and attributed the low carrier mobility to the poor crystallinity. In 2008, Ou et al. demonstrated the fabrication of a complementary inverter by tuning the annealing temperature, which created a p-type conductivity in tin oxide thin films, with carrier mobility of 0.011 cm2/\nV s and ION/IOFF ratio - 103.\n27 The first p-channel TFT with SnO as the channel layer material, which offered a carrier mobility and ION/IOFF ratio of lsat = 0.7 cm2/V s and - 102, respectively, was reported by Ogo et al. in 2009.28 This work led to the growth of tin oxide TFTs for CMOS applications.\nIn 2011, Nomura et al.29 reported the fabrication of ambipolar TFT with polycrystalline SnO as an active channel layer material as well as a CMOSlike inverter by using two SnO ambipolar TFTs, which was the first work to demonstrate the possibility of fabricating an oxide-based complementary inverter based on a single channel material. In recent years, research in tin oxide-based TFTs has progressed rapidly and is discussed in the following sections.\nOrigin Of The N-Type And P-Type Conductivities In Tin Oxide\nMost oxide semiconductors show n-type conduction which limits their application in unipolar ntype TFTs, and hence p-type oxide semiconductor materials were investigated to extend their applications. In addition, p-type oxide semiconductors can be used in a wide range of applications such as CMOS circuits, active-matrix liquid-crystal displays (AMLCD) and flexible electronics.\nSnO2 is an n-type transparent semiconductor with a wide band gap of 3.6 eV, and it crystallizes into a tetragonal rutile structure (space group P42/\nmnm).30–33 SnO2 is the most stable state of tin oxide and is reported have a strong n-type conductivity due to the presence of intrinsic defects such as oxygen vacancies (VO).34,35 Kılıc¸ et al. used firstprinciples calculations to prove that the n-type conductivity in undoped SnO2 is governed by the shallow donor levels produced by tin interstitials\n(Sni) and VO due to the multivalent nature of tin.20 They also reported that Sni has a more significant effect on carrier mobility compared to VO owing to some properties such as low formation energy, and donor level formation inside the conduction band which leads to instantaneous conductivity. These defects are attributed to the natural non-stoichiometry of SnO2. Moreover, spherically symmetric ns orbitals of metal oxides result in a very low electron effective mass (me), which leads to high carrier mobility in n-type oxides, since low me causes uniformity in electron charge density distribution and decreases scattering.36 SnO2 has a very low electron effective mass (0.18 me) compared to aIGZO (0.33 me),37,38 which indicates that SnO2 has a better mobility than a-IGZO.\nSnO exists in a metastable state and exhibits ptype conduction.39 The structure of SnO is layered in a Sn-O-Sn sequence similar to that of lead oxide (PbO), which has a tetrahedral coordination. SnO has a direct band gap of 2.5–3.0 eV and indirect band gap of 0.7 eV.32,40. Figure 1 shows the differences between the structures of SnO and SnO2. It is hard to achieve a high hole mobility in p-type oxide materials because the 2p orbitals of the oxygen ions form a deep localized valence band maximum\n(VBM) and the hole transport paths are anisotropic due to hopping conduction.41,42 Nevertheless, SnO\nis a promising p-type oxide semiconductor since its VBM is composed of O 2p hybridized orbitals.42,43 The spherical Sn 5s orbitals and O 2p orbitals form a hybridized VBM which increases the hole mobility.41 Figure 2 shows the band gaps of SnO2 and SnO. Ogo et al. reported that the formation of hybridized orbitals in SnO was attributed to the pseudo-closed ns2 orbital of Sn metal cations.28 The p-type conductivity of SnO was ascribed to the tin vacancies (Vsn) and oxygen interstitials\n(Oi).43 Fortunato et al.44 reported that Vsn plays a more important role in hole generation, compared to Oi, because the Vsn formation takes place easier than Oi. Togo et al.45 confirmed this using firstprinciples calculations, and they concluded that Oi does not contribute to the conductivity. The formation of tetravalency (4+) in Sn atoms was attributed to the presence of interstitial oxygen atoms, since these Oi attract a lone pair of electrons from the nearest-neighbouring Sn atoms.46 Figure 3 shows\nHybridized orbitals conductivity in SnO. 41 In 2019, Barros et al.\nreported high hole mobility ( μ sat = 4.6 cm 2 /V s) and a high I ON /I OFF ratio (7 × 10 4 ). 4\nGeneral Device Structure And Electrical Parameters Of Tfts\nTypically, TFTs are fabricated in bottom-gate and top-gate configurations based on the position of the gate and source/drain electrodes with respect to the staggered structure. 46 , 47 The overall design principle for a TFT is that the semiconducting layer should be in direct contact with the two electrodes (source/drain), and the third electrode (gate) should be separated by a dielectric layer. The gate modulates the conductivity of the semiconductor layer through the dielectric material, which is in accordance with the field effect principle. Figure 4 illustrates the structures commonly used for TFTs.\nGenerally, most of the SnOx TFTs are fabricated in a bottom-gate (BG) configuration, which employs a staggered structure with a top contact (TC). A BGTC configuration is commonly used, since it is an easily processable structure, in which only a few masks are required, and the substrate itself largely acts as a gate layer (e.g., heavily doped n+ and p+-Si wafer), which further reduces the deposition steps and cost of fabrication.6,47,48 However, this structure shows some drawbacks, such as the changes in the TFT characteristics when the back-channel is exposed to ambience, and damage to the backchannel during patterning or etching of the source/\ndrain contacts.47,49 To address these issues, an appropriate passivation layer or etch stopper should be used.\nIn order to have a better understanding of the electrical characteristics which determine the TFT device performance, it is essential to have a clear idea about the device parameters, such as field effect mobility (lFE), subthreshold swing (S), and threshold voltage (Vth).46,47 Mobility is the efficiency of carrier transport through an active channel, and it can be described by drain current (ID) with respect to drain voltage (VD) as follows:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{D}}={\\frac{W\\mu C_{\\mathrm{i}}}{L}}\\left[(V_{\\mathrm{G}}-V_{\\mathrm{th}})V_{\\mathrm{D}}{\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{D}}^{2}}{2}}\\right]\\qquad\\qquad(1)$$\nwhere L is the active channel length; W is the active channel width; VG is the gate voltage; Ci is the capacitance per unit area of the gate insulator. Equation (1) can be used to calculate the mobility.\nThe threshold voltage (Vth) is defined as the minimum gate-source voltage (VGS) required to create a conducting path between the source and drain.\nTransconductance (gm) is the rate of the change in ID to the change in VG, which is used to calculate the mobility.\n$$g_{\\mathrm{m}}\\,=\\,{\\frac{\\partial I_{\\mathrm{D}}}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{G}}}}$$\n$$\\mathbf{\\Sigma}(2)$$\nIn linear regimes (i.e., gm at low VD), mobility is defined as the linear mobility (llin):\n$$\\mu_{\\mathrm{lin}}={\\frac{L g_{\\mathrm{m}}}{W C_{\\mathrm{i}}V_{\\mathrm{D}}}}$$\nIn saturation regimes (i.e., VD  (VG  Vth), gm at high VD–), saturation mobility (lsat) is defined by the following equation:\n$$\\mu_{\\mathrm{sat}}={\\frac{2L}{W C_{\\mathrm{i}}}}\\left({\\frac{\\partial{\\sqrt{I_{\\mathrm{D}}}}}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{G}}}}\\right)^{2}$$\n$$({\\boldsymbol{3}})$$\n$$({\\mathfrak{s}})$$\nSubthreshold swing is defined as the VG required for one decade increase in ID and can be calculated using the transfer characteristics as follows:\n$$S={\\frac{\\mathrm{d}V_{\\mathrm{GS}}}{\\mathrm{d}(\\log_{10}V_{\\mathrm{D}})}}$$\nS is useful in determining the switching speed of the TFT and the total trap density near the semiconductor/gate-dielectric interface.\nThe poor stability of the AOS TFTs under stress conditions is one of the major issues which decreases their performance and limits their application in display devices. A shift in threshold voltage (DVth) is created by the electrical and illumination stresses imposed on TFTs while operating in devices such as AMLCDs. A change in luminance of approximately 20% was reported in organic light-emitting diode (OLED) pixels, even at a DVth of the driving transistor = 0.1 V.50 In order to examine the stability of the TFTs, accelerated operating tests, such as positive bias stress (PBS), positive bias temperature stress (PBTS), positive bias illumination stress (PBIS),\nnegative bias stress (NBS), negative bias temperature stress (NBTS), and negative bias illumination stress (NBIS) tests, are typically performed. The electron–hole pairs generated by light and heat are transported to the gate surface and trapped in the gate-dielectric interface.49 These charge traps in the gate-dielectric interface and the increase in the shallow donors in the channel result in the occurrence of DVth in TFTs.51 The stability of TFTs can be significantly enhanced by doping, since it can reduce the charge trap density.50 The stability of TFTs can also be improved by using a suitable device structure, passivation layer, dielectric material, and thermal treatments.52\nEmerging Applications Of Snox-Based Tfts Flat-Panel Display Devices\nThe AOS TFTs find their most dynamic application in display devices such as AMLCD and OLED\ndisplays. AMLCDs and OLEDs utilize TFTs for switching and operating the individual pixels. Typically, a simple pixel circuit for an active-matrix OLED (AMOLED) display requires two TFTs in which one acts as switching transistor (sends data to the pixel) and the other acts as a driving transistor (drives the current to the LED).52,53 The OLED displays employing compensation circuits require additional TFTs as well as two capacitors.\nFor small-sized AMOLED displays like smartphone screens, higher carrier mobility (- 100 cm2/V s) is required for fast operation within small pixel dimensions. The mobility requirement for largesized AMOLED displays is about 30 cm2/V s.52 Furthermore, recent research has focused on completely transparent flexible TFTs for next-generation display devices. Studies have indicated that a tin oxide TFT can effectively satisfy the mobility requirements of the current display devices. The prominent research and development in tin oxides and their composite-based TFTs in the past few years has resulted in their near commercialisation in the display device industries.\nCMOS inverters can be used for integrated circuit applications due to their low power consumption, high logic swing output, high noise margin, and high circuit integration density.54 CMOS inverters comprises both n- and p-type TFTs to perform logic operations. As mentioned earlier, n-type oxide semiconductors are extensively studied and have shown exceptional electrical performance compared to their p-type counterparts. Initially CMOS inverters used the combination of different oxide/organic active channel materials for p-type TFTs, due to the lack of high-performance p-type oxide semiconductors.55,56 The fabrication of completely oxide-based CMOS-like inverters requires the development of high-performance p-type oxide semiconductors.\nMoreover, oxide semiconductors operating in ambipolar mode are used extensively in CMOS-like inverters to minimize the fabrication and patterning processes and to produce compact circuit architectures. The fabrication constraints of oxide ambipolar transistors are the wide band gap and sub-gap states. SnO exhibits very good electrical performance as a p-type AOS and shows excellent ambipolar behaviour by effective conduction of both electrons and holes in a TFT. The low electron effective mass (- 0.4 me), low hole effective mass (- 0.6 mh), and small fundamental band gap\n(- 0.7 eV) contribute to the ambipolar behaviour of SnO.57 The first complete oxide-based CMOS inverters, which exhibited voltage gain of - 11, incorporated tin oxide as a p-type and indium oxide as an n-type TFT.56 Following this work, several CMOS inverters were fabricated with tin oxide as a p-channel TFT and IGZO/ZnO as an n-channel TFT.54 In 2008, Ou et al. fabricated a completely tin oxide-based CMOS inverter by combining two tin oxide devices with different threshold voltages that attained output gain of 2.8.27 Yabuta et al.58 proposed a single-step fabrication of n-SnO2/p-SnO channel complementary circuits using a SiOx capping layer\n(Fig. 5). The capping layer controlled the incorporation of excess oxygen during annealing which protected the p-type SnO, and the portion without SiOx capping served as n-channel SnO2.\nNomura et al.29 fabricated the first ambipolar SnO TFT and constructed a CMOS-like inverter using two ambipolar SnO TFTs (Fig. 6). They attributed the ambipolar behaviour of SnO to the reduction trap states caused by the decrease in the channel thickness (- 15 nm). They obtained a maximum voltage of - 2.5, and the p- and n-type SnO\nTFTs exhibited lsat of 0.8 and 5 9 104 cm2/V s, respectively.29 Nayak et al. fabricated both p- and n-type channel TFTs by controlling the concentration of hydroxyl groups (OH groups) in the dielectric layer. They used solution-derived (SD) Al2O3 on a part of SnO\nthin film and atomic layer-deposited (ALD) Al2O3 on the other part (Fig. 7). The large number of OH\ngroups in the SD Al2O3 film acted as an additional oxygen source during annealing, which resulted in\nthe conversion of SnO to SnO2. However, due to the negligible OH content in the ALD Al2O3 film, the SnO phase was consistent.59\nProgress And Optimization Of Snox-Based Tfts\nIn early tin oxide-based TFTs, the active channel layer was typically polycrystalline, with high carrier concentrations, and exhibited poor electrical performance such as low mobility and low ON/OFF ratio.\nThe decrease in carrier mobility was attributed to the carrier scattering at the grain boundaries. The charge traps at the grain boundaries interrupted the movement of the charge carriers, which resulted in their decreased mobility. Qu et al. suggested that the formation of surface trap states in SnOx TFT is attributable to the ambient adsorption of moisture and oxygen at the grain boundaries.60 Moreover, the drop in the device performance and poor stability were attributed to the grain boundaries in crystalline SnOx TFTs. For example, a decrease in the mobility of water-exposed SnOx TFTs was attributed to the interaction between the hole charges and the polar water molecules at the grain boundaries, which increased the energy barrier for hole intergrain transport.39,61 In recent years, several studies were carried out to rectify these issues that involve the utilization of a-SnOx and shielding with a passivation layer. The major works in SnOx-based TFTs are summarized in Table I.\nAs mentioned earlier, it is possible to enhance the carrier mobility in amorphous SnOx TFTs due to the absence of grain boundaries, which agrees with the previous reports listed in Table I. In addition, the utilization of an amorphous active channel layer enhances uniformity and device stability. To address the stability issues and achieve high-performance amorphous SnOx-based TFTs, several routes have been explored (i.e., doping, passivation, and deposition parameters), and the following section discusses the role of doping.\nThe Effect Of Doping On The Tin Oxide Active Channel Layer\nThe amorphous phase can be obtained by mixing two or more cations with different ionic charges and sizes, which inhibits the crystallization process.67 The free electrons generated by the oxygen vacancy defects result in high carrier concentration leading to large off current which requires large power consumption.51,52 The incorporation of suitable dopants controls the VO in AOS films.67 Hence, doping is beneficial in attaining an amorphous phase, better stability, reduced carrier concentration, and low power consumption in AOS TFTs.\nSome of the dopants (Table II) used for SnOx TFTs are discussed in this section as follows:\nNotably, p-type conductivity was observed in aluminium-doped SnOx TFTs. This can be attributed to the holes generated by the substitution of Al3+ ions in Sn4+ sites, with appropriate Al concentration\n| Table I.

Owing to the degradation in the Sn4+ state, a significant reduction in the off current was also observed.71 However, the electrical properties of the Ag-doped SnOx TFTs deteriorated because of carrier scattering in the grain boundaries.71 Figure 8 shows the comparison between the output characteristics of intrinsic and Ag-doped SnOx TFTs.\nSi-doped SnOx (STO) films exhibited n-type conductivity and extensively reduced the oxygen vacancies within the SnOx films.72,73 Figure 9a shows the schematic structure of STO films. Liu et al. reported that incorporating an appropriate concentration of Si in SnOx effectively suppressed the carrier concentration and resulted in an STO TFT (annealed at 350C) with better carrier mobility (8.14 cm2/V s)\nand high ION/IOFF ratio (6.07 9 109).73 Ning et al.\nshowed that the STO films exhibited a significant tensile strength which reduced crystallization, widened the optical band gap (to 4.15 eV), enhanced the electrical performance, and minimised the defects in the film. The tensile strength of the STO\nfilms is extremely dependent on the annealing\ntemperature.74 Moreover, only a minimal variation in DVth was observed in STO TFTs under PBS and NBS conditions (Fig. 9b), which indicates a very good bias stability of the device as a result of Si doping.72,73\nNi doping significantly enhances the amorphous characteristics in SnOx thin films due to the structural difference between SnOx (rutile) and nickel oxide (face-centred cubic). In Ni-doped SnOx (NTO)\nfilms, Ni atoms substitute the Sn atoms and compensate for the oxygen vacancy defects.75 Since Ni atoms provide only two electrons (instead of four electrons by Sn atoms), Ni doping efficiently reduces the generation of free electrons and carrier concentration. Yang et al. reported that NTO TFTs offered low off current, better mobility (8.4 cm2/V s), and high ION/IOFF ratio (2.1 9 107). Nevertheless, the NTO TFTs showed a significant deterioration in stability under PBS and NBS conditions.75\nGa-doped SnOx (GTO) TFTs exhibited good carrier suppression by inhibiting the VO in tin oxide, owing to the higher oxygen affinity of Ga compared to Sn.17,18,76,77 Figure 10a shows the schematic structure of GTO films. Ga doping induces the amorphous phase formation while maintaining the structural integrity. It is noteworthy that the In3+ ions in IGZO and Sn4+ ions in GTO have the same electronic structure (4p64d10), since the 5s orbital serves as a path for current flow in both, which was expected to provide better electrical performance.18,78 Matsuda et al. fabricated GTO TFTs with good carrier mobility (25.6 cm2/V s) and ION/\nIOFF ratio (108).18 However, Wang et al. reported the instability of GTO TFTs exhibited under NBIS and NBTS\n![10_image_0.png](10_image_0.png)\nconditions (Fig. 10c) due to the charge traps at the channel-dielectric interface and the absorption of oxygen from the ambient air. 77 Recently, Ren et al.\nreported that the instability problems in GTO TFTs at room temperature exhibited comparatively low mobility (0.48 cm 2 /V s). 78 However, Ga is sensitive to the etching processes, and the reported results indicate that GTO TFTs fabricated without passivation were more prone to instability.\nZirconium doping in SnOx resulted in effective reduction of the deep trap states and improvement in the bias stability. 79 Han et al. indicated that incorporating Zr in SnOx decreased the Vo and suppressed the carrier concentration as Zr promoted oxidation in SnOx due to the higher binding energy of Zr-O (766.1 kJ/mol). 67 , 79 Zr-doped SnOx TFTs exhibited low mobility (1.04 cm 2 /V s); however, a fair decrease in the subthreshold swing\n(0.78 V/decade) and the turn-on voltage was observed. 79\nAntimony doping improved the conductivity of the SnO2 films, because each atom of Sb can donate one electron to the conduction band of SnO 2 as the outer shell electronic configuration of Sb and Sn are 5s 5p 3 and 5s 25p 2 , respectively. 80 , 81 Sun et al.\nreported that Sb doping narrowed the barrier depletion region and increased the chances for electron tunnelling, resulting in an improved device Sabnis et al. reported that an performance. 80 increase in the Sb content beyond 10% resulted in non-conductivity due to the excessive impurityinduced disorders. 81 Room temperature-fabricated Sb-doped SnOx with a 2:100 wt. ratio of Sb:Sn, which was reported by Sun et al., exhibited excellent mobility (158 cm 2 /V s). They also tested the\n![10_image_1.png](10_image_1.png)\n![10_image_2.png](10_image_2.png)\n![10_image_3.png](10_image_3.png)\nimpact of aging in Sb-doped SnOx TFTs under ambient conditions, which resulted in the deterioration of their electrical performance (i.e., the carrier mobility shifted to 98.3 cm 2 /V s) due to the adsorption of oxygen and water at the channel surface (Fig. 11 ). 80 Nevertheless, these results suggest that Sb doping is useful in the low-temperature fabrication of high-mobility SnOx TFTs, and suitable encapsulation ensures a prolonged lifetime of the device.\nstrong Hafnium oxygen ions are binders\n(801.7 kJ/mol), and hence Vo defects were controlled in Hf-doped SnOx TFTs. Doping with Hf reduced the deep trap density in SnOx as the electrons in the deep trap sites are thermally activated into the conduction band and driven toward the electrodes by the addition of Hf in SnOx.\n50 Kim et al. and Han et al. showed that negligible DVON was observed in Hf-doped SnOx TFTs compared to the intrinsic SnOx TFTs (Fig. 12),\nand hence Hf plays a vital role in improving the PBS\nand NBTI stability of TFT by suppressing the deep trap states and total trap density.50,82\nYang et al. reported that W doping efficiently suppressed the oxygen adsorption and increased the aging stability of SnOx TFTs.83 They also reported that tuning the turn-on current is possible by W doping since it reduced the S and increased ION/IOFF ratio. W doping enhanced carrier suppression and inhibited crystallization. The reports indicated that W doping reduces the impurity phases in SnOx. The doping concentration of W significantly affected the electrical properties of W-doped SnOx TFTs (Fig. 13).83 W-doped SnOx TFTs displayed a comparatively low mobility (5 cm2/V s) and ION/IOFF\nratio (2.4 9 106); however, a low off current and S\n(0.4 V/decade) were observed.83\nDoping bismuth was found to suppress the carrier concentration, improve the surface roughness, restrain the crystallization of SnOx, and increases uniformity. However, the excess Bi content\n(> 4 wt.%) caused the mobility of Bi-doped SnOx\n(BTO) TFT to deteriorate.84 Yang et al. reported that when compared with intrinsic SnOx TFT, BTO\nTFTs showed negligible variations in the PBS\nstability and large deterioration in the NBS stability, which can be minimized by using a suitable passivation layer. BTO TFTs with suitable Bi doping concentration (2.7 wt.%) exhibited a field effect mobility of 4.7 cm2/V s and ION/IOFF ratio of 2.3 9 10684 Based on these results (Table II), some points are recommended to improve the electrical performance and stability of the SnOx TFTs. Choosing a suitable dopant plays a crucial role in solving the key issues in SnOx TFTs such as high carrier concentration and instability under bias stress conditions.\nPrevious reports suggest that the Lewis acid strength (L) and metal–oxygen (M–O) bonding strength are important parameters affecting the ability of the dopant to suppress the carriers by reducing the oxygen vacancy defects.69 Dopants with large L and M–O bonding strength inhibit the ejection of oxygen atoms from the SnOx film during the sputtering or annealing processes, leading to the effective reduction of the generation of free charge carriers from the oxygen vacancy defects.\nIn addition, the reported results indicate that the doping concentration plays a vital role in the electrical performance of the TFT. Particularly, in the case of dopants (Al and Ag) that induce the ptype conductivity, at dopant concentrations below the optimal value, n-type conductivity was observed irrespective of the deposition conditions. These deviations occur due to the insufficient dopant concentration in the SnOx TFT that cannot enable holes to be the majority carriers. The electrical properties of the SnOx TFT were also found to deteriorate when the doping content exceeded a specific ratio. Therefore, it is essential to explore the optimal doping level.\nA detailed review was carried out on the sputterdeposited SnOx-based TFTs. Though SnOx TFTs have been reported since 1964, the problems associated with the high carrier concentration and device uniformity have restricted their commercial use. However, the scarcity of indium in the earth's crust and the growing demand for high-performance TFTs resulted in the renaissance of SnOx-based TFTs. Despite the progress in the past decades, the research on SnOx-based TFTs still faces several problems, such as instability, grain boundary scattering, and high conductivity, that hinder the achievement of SnOx-based TFTs with high electrical performance. This review addressed some of the approaches used to improve the stability and performance of these devices. The amorphization of SnOx eliminates the carrier scattering and improves the uniformity of the TFTs. Sputter-deposited intrinsic a-SnOx TFTs showed a very high mobility of lFE = 147 cm2/V s and a high ION/IOFF ratio of\n> 107, which evidences the opportunities of SnOx TFTs in FPD applications and other circuit areas. The incorporation of various dopants, such as Al, Ag, Si, Ga, Ni, Zr, Hf, Sb, W, and Bi, in SnOx TFTs and their impact on the electrical stability and mobility of the device was discussed. In particular, a low-temperature (150C)-processed p-type Al-Sn-Ox TFT with a comparatively high mobility (2.27 cm2/\nV s) and ION/IOFF ratio (107) was competitive with other reports on p-type semiconductors. The effect of M–O bonding strength and Lewis acid strength of dopants was previously reported. This should be considered while choosing the dopants to improve the electrical performance of SnOx TFTs. The dualvalence nature of Sn facilitates the development of both n-type and p-type active channels. The phase transition between n-type and p-type can be effectively achieved by fine tuning of the deposition parameters during sputtering. This shows the feasibility of fabricating SnOx TFTs for CMOS applications. The limited supply and high manufacturing cost will restrict the usage of indium in the upcoming years. Since SnOx does not suffer from these factors, SnOx-based TFTs could significantly replace indium-based TFTs through careful consideration of the deposition parameters, selection of suitable dopants, utilization of appropriate passivation A Review on the Recent Advancements in Tin Oxide-Based Thin-Film Transistors for LargeArea Electronics layer, and optimizations, and would strongly impact the electronics industries.\nThe authors are thankful to the Department of Science and Technology-Science and Engineering Research Board, Government of India, for financial support under the Core Research Grant (File No. CRG/2019/002107).

A slight horizontal streaks issue observed on RG/GB/RB mixed color image under middle and low grayscale display is analyzed and discussed. The modeling and simulation results indicate that the issue is related to the drive architecture of Zigzag-column inversion under charging insufficient of source lines.\nAuthor Keywords IGZO; DEMUX; BCE; Narrow bezel; Notebook LCD\n Introduction In recent years, \"full screen\" and \"narrow bezel\" has been a new direction of development and competition in the field of notebook LCDs. De-multiplex (DEMUX) technology applied to LCDs can reduce the number of ICs used and narrow the bezel, by decomposing one single signal into multiple channel signals using multiple TFTs to control . Currently, low temperature polysilicon (LTPS) DEMUX technology is being applied in smartphones and notebook LCDs in the market to realize a full screen visuals and narrow bezel . However, the disadvantage of LTPS is evident that high cost in process and high leakage current in property . which are hindering its extensive development.\nIGZO semiconductor own high mobility, maximum switching ratio, minimum leakage current and lower process cost . Therefore, we develop an IGZO DEMUX technology and make the 13.3 inches FHD (1920 × 1080) DEMUX LCDs successfully. A back-channel etching (BCE) process are used to save the cost. A DEMUX 1:3 technology is adopted to reduce the source ICs on panel from 4 to 1. Combing with TconEmbedded Driver (TED) technology, the module bottom border of the LCD is implemented to less than 15mm. Table 1 shows the comparison of normal design and IGZO TED DEMUX 1:3 LCDs.\nDEMUX 1:3 Normal Design TED DEMUX 1:3 A Study on De-multiplex Technology Based on IGZO Semiconductor for Notebook LCDs Wei Yang, Qiang Shu, Huaipei Wang, Jie Li, Zhijun Wang R&D Center, Nanjing CEC Panda FPD Technology Co., Ltd, Nanjing/Jiangsu, China Abstract We proposed a DEMUX (De-multiple) technology based on IGZO BCE-type TFT structure and produced the 13.3 inches FHD LCDs for notebook. The adoption of DEMUX 1:3 circuit on In the IGZO DEMUX LCDs, the driving architecture is Zigzagcolumn inversion, which is commonly applied in medium-sized LCDs to achieve a display quality of dot inversion by pixels arrangement. In this paper, a display issue of the slight horizontal streaks that can be observed on mixed color images (RG/GB/RB) under middle and low grayscale is analyzed and discussed in detail combing with the results of SILVACO simulations and waveform adjustment experiments.\n The IGZO BCE-type TFT\nIn order to save the mask costs and reduce the circuit area, a back-channel etching (BCE) process is adopted. The normal ESL-type TFT needs a larger design area for contact holes between channel layer and Source/Drain layer. Compare to it, the BCE-type TFT structure is conducive to achieve high PPI\nLCDs. For IGZO DEMUX technology, the adoption of BCE\nprocess can decrease the design area of DEMUX circuit to narrow the panel down border. Figure 1 shows the IGZO BCEtype TFT structure applied to DEMUX circuit and other places on panel.\n DEMUX LCD Architecture\nFigure 2 shows the picture of 13.3 inches IGZO DEMUX 1:3 demo. The panel architecture is shown in Figure 3. The multiplexer type is 1 to 3 that one source signal is divided into three channels to send to active area of LCD respectively.\nGenerally, a column inversion driving is adopted in panel for lower logic consumption. For a sub-pixel, the ideal optical response waveform should be a 60Hz wave shape. However, the actual sub-pixel optical response waveform often is changed to 30Hz which is recognizable for human eyes due to the Vp voltage shift caused by the actual Vcom voltage offset and liquid crystal leakage of the LCD. For medium-sized LCDs with larger size sub-pixels, if only a simple column inversion driving is adopted, the vertical line flicker can be observed on screen. It will reduce the display quality of LCDs. Therefore, a Zigzagcolumn inversion is applied to drive pixels as shown in Figure 3.\nThe adjacent pixels own the opposite driving polarity, so their waveforms are spatially fused that the human eye can't distinguish the flicker existing in each sub-pixel.\n The charging of DEMUX LCD\nThe main factors affecting the charging of DEMUX LCD pixels are the MUX TFT size, the RC loading of active area source lines and the charging time of source lines. For the normal design LCD, the IC outputs are connected to the active area source lines one by one, while for the DEMUX 1:3 LCD, one IC\noutput signal is controlled by three MUX TFTs and transmitted to three corresponding active area source lines in a time-sharing manner.\n The charging time of the source lines and the corresponding pixel rows is only 1/3 of the normal design LCD. If the charging ability of MUX TFT and pixel TFT is insufficient, there is a risk of insufficient of pixel charging. Because of the difference in mobility, the IGZO TFT with the same size has a lower charging ability than that of LTPS TFT. The resistance and capacitance of IGZO TFT itself will cause a certain signal delay in active area source lines. Therefore, it is essential to choose a proper IGZO MUX TFT size. Our simulation research has found that if the MUX TFT is large enough to ensure the signal delay in active source lines no longer decreasing with the MUX TFT size increasing, it means that the MUX TFT charging ability is saturated. In this situation, if the RC loading of source lines is too large and the charging time is too short, the expected potential of source lines still can't be reached and the corresponding pixels cannot be charged to preset potential too, even if the TFT size and charging time of pixels are sufficient.\n The slight horizontal streaks issue Through the quality evaluation and testing, we found that the full screen slight horizontal streaks can always be observed on DEMUX 1:3 LCD samples under middle and low grayscale when showing RG/GB/RB mixed color images. At the frame frequency of 60Hz, the horizontal streaks cannot disappear by adjusting the driving waveform. At the frame frequency of 30Hz, firstly we set the charging time of MUX CK to be the same as at 60Hz. By adjusting the time interval between Gn and CKA rising time, the horizontal streaks still can be observed. In this way, the influence of wrong charging on horizontal streaks was excluded. After then, the time interval between Gn and CKC falling time was adjusted to ensure that the feedthrough recovery time of the MUX CKC charging pixels were sufficient, however, the horizontal streaks still existed. Finally, we set an appropriate driving waveform relationship and double the charging time of source lines at 30Hz frame frequency, the slight horizontal streaks on screen disappeared with a little flicker. Therefore, the horizontal streaks is related to the insufficient charging time. The detail generation mechanism was analyzed with the help of SILVACO software modeling and simulation.\n6. **SILVACO modeling and simulation**\nTo analyze the slight horizontal streaks issue, we used Gateway software to model the panel circuit architecture. The modeling schematic is shown in Figure 4. The driving timing was set the same as the actual IC driving timing for the mixed color (RG) image with Zigzag-column inversion driving as shown in Figure 5. The driving timing of MUX CK was ABCABC. The simulation was carried out with a matched modelcard of LCD\nsamples by Smartspice software. The Smartspice simulation results were checked and analyzed. We found that the occurrence of horizontal streaks was related to the Zigzagcolumn inversion driving architecture.\n The generation mechanism of horizontal\nIn Zigzag-column inversion driving LCD, some fixed-position source lines connect with both R and G pixels, such as S2 and S5 shown in Figure 3. In order to show RG mixed color image, these source lines need to be charged in each pixel row. The corresponding MUX TFTs turn on and the source lines are charged with VDH potential by IC output. When the MUX TFT turn off, the source lines potential is maintained. Because these source lines are charged both in odd and even rows, their potential are always at the expected VDH state. This can be regard as a \"pre-charge\" effect for these source lines. Therefore, the connecting R and G pixels could be charged to expected VDH potential because of the \"pre-charge\" effect.\nHowever, for some other fixed-position source lines such as S1, S3, S4, S6, the connecting pixels are one of R or G pixels and the other connecting pixels are B. These source lines are not always at the expected VDH potential sate in one frame since the connecting B pixels need to be charge to VDL under RG mixed color image. These source lines are charged from VDL to VDH every time when the corresponding R or G pixels need to be charged. This means there is no \"pre-charge\" effect for these source lines. If the driving ability of MUX TFT insufficient without enough TFT size, the RC loading of source lines heavy or the charging time of MUX TFT too short, these source lines without \"pre-charge\" effect only can be charged to a lower V'DH potential as shown in Figure 6. The corresponding R or G pixels also only can be charged to the lower V'DH potential.\nConsequently, the charging of R and G pixels connected with S1 and S5 source lines and connected with S1, S3, S4, S6 is different. The charging potential difference of these fixedposition pixels exists in each grayscale display. In high grayscale display, the brightness difference caused by the pixel charging potential difference is too small and not enough to be observed by the human eyes. But in middle and low grayscale display, the brightness difference is too large to be observed obviously. Therefore, the charging difference of source lines results in the slight horizontal streaks issue of RG mixed color image under middle and low grayscale display. The same simulation and analysis method are used for GB and RB mixed color images, it is found that their horizontal streaks issue generation mechanism is consistent with that of RG mixed color image.\nimage and the charging of source lines and pixels To verify the above simulation and analysis results, a series tests were conducted. Under RG/GB/RB color mixing image, we respectively moved the falling edge of the MUX CK waveform which corresponding to the undercharged source lines properly as analyzed above to increase the time of the MUX TFT turned on. Thereby the charging time of the source lines was increased, and the source lines were charged to a higher potential. If the horizontal streaks become lighten or disappear, it can be demonstrated that the horizontal streaks are indeed caused by the reason as above analyzed. Finally, in all the experiment we observed that the horizontal streaks under RG/GB/RB mixed color images screen are all alleviated. Therefore, the above analysis results were confirmed.\n Conclusion In this paper, we reported the 13.3 inches FHD DEMUX LCDs which were manufactured by IGZO BCE-type TFT structure. The narrow bezel less than 15mm has been realized combing with TED technology. The generation mechanism of slight horizontal streaks issue observed on RG/GB/RB mixed color images under middle and low grayscale display was analyzed. According to modeling and simulation, it was found that the Zigzag-column inversion driving architecture can cause the charging difference of fixed-position source lines in active area because of the insufficient charging of source lines.\nConsequently, the corresponding connecting pixels of these source lines are charged to different potential resulting in the slight horizontal streaks issue.\n Moez K.

        "text": "A Study On H2 Plasma Treatment Effect On A-Igzo Thin Film Transistor\nJihoon Kim, Seokhwan Bang, Seungjun Lee, Seokyoon Shin, and Joohyun Park Division of Materials Science and Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul 133-791, Korea Hyungtak Seoa)\nDepartment of Materials Science & Engineering, Ajou University, Woncheon-Dong, Yeongtong-Gu, Suwon 443-739, Korea Hyeongtag Jeonb)\nDivision of Materials Science and Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul 133-791, Korea (Received 4 January 2012; accepted 1 June 2012)\nWe report the effect of H2 plasma treatment on amorphous indium–gallium–zinc–oxide (a-IGZO)\nthin-film transistor (TFT). The changes in electrical characteristics and stability of the a-IGZO TFT\ntreated by H2 plasma were evaluated under thermal stress. Each device exhibited a change in the subthreshold swing, turn on voltage shift, and hysteresis depending on the amount of hydrogen atom. It was found that there occurred a decrease of oxygen deficiency and an increase of hydrogen content in channel layer and channel/dielectric interface with increasing treatment time. The proper hydrogen dose well passivated the oxygen vacancies; however, more hydrogen dose acted as excessive donors. The change of oxygen vacancy and total trap charge were explained by the activation energy from Arrhenius plot. Through this study, we found that the optimized H2 plasma treatment brings device stability by affecting oxygen vacancy and trap content in channel bulk and channel/dielectric interface.\nOver the past 10 years, flat panel display (FPD) has been developed significantly using amorphous and polycrystalline silicon. The success of silicon-based display has contributed to the growth of display industry. Recently, however, its growth based on Si-based FPD seems to be saturated and reaches to the limitation as the new paradigm of displays emerges, and this requires more advanced functionalities and specifications. For instance, the smart devices such as smart phone, tablet PC demand high pixel resolution to zoom in an arbitrary area of screen, and the three-dimensional (3D) display such as 3D TV requires ultra definition pixel resolution and high aperture ratio. Therefore, the current technological specifications require fast, flexible, and transparent display, calling for the use of better display materials than Si. For these reasons, a variety of materials were studied by many groups for next generation display. Among them, amorphous indium–gallium–zinc–oxide (a-IGZO) has been reported to be a good candidate, and a-IGZO thinfilm transistor (TFT) has emerged as a promising solution for high performance backplanes in next generation display because it can provide high mobility, high optical transparency, and applicability for the low-temperature process compared to conventional silicon-based TFT.1,2 To improve the performance of practical a-IGZO applications, most of the studies focused on adjusting process variables such as gas partial pressure, chemical components of a-IGZO, contact resistance, and different plasma treatments. Some research group introduced the effect of hydrogen on the properties of oxide semiconductor.3,4 Additionally, Tsao et al.5 found that the hydrogen-induced passivation of interface trap states between a-IGZO and dielectric layer caused an improvement in subthreshold swing (SS). Even though there are many advantages, it is important to control the hydrogen dose because device stability is sensitive to the amount of hydrogen after plasma treatment. Also, it is important to analyze the role of hydrogen in a-IGZO film.\nTherefore, through this study, we show the change in characteristics of TFT, the role of hydrogen in a-IGZO,\nand the change of oxygen vacancy and trap charge density with the amount of hydrogen dose. We fabricated a-IGZO TFTs with different hydrogen plasma treatment time. Al2O3 passivation layer was deposited to protect the TFT from the ambient atmosphere. Temperature instability test was carried out to examine the electrical property change, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)/\nsecondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) was used to analyze the chemical changes. Based on the Arrhenius equation, the activation energy for devices was calculated, which would account for the change of the oxygen vacancy and trap charge density.\nIi. Experimental Details\nA typical bottom gate-type device structure was used for the fabrication of the a-IGZO TFTs. A thermally grown 100 nm thick SiO2 layer on a p-type Si (1-10 Xcm)\nwas used as substrate in fabricating the TFTs. Si and SiO2 were used as the gate electrode and gate dielectric, respectively. A 70-nm-thick a-IGZO film was deposited to function as active layer by using radio frequency (RF)\nmagnetron sputtering at room temperature. The composition of the a-IGZO target was 1:1:1 mol% of In2O3:Ga2O3:\nZnO. The sputtering was performed with an Ar/O2 gas with a mixing ratio of 54:2, at a RF power of 100 W, and a working pressure of 5.0 mTorr. A liftoff process was used to define the channel patterns, and the channel length\n(L) and width (W) were 200 and 800 lm, respectively.\nAfter deposition of the channel layer, source/drain electrodes of Ti/Au (80/40 nm) were deposited with an e-beam evaporator. All the fabricated devices were annealed in the forming gas ambient at 250 °C for 1 h. Hydrogen plasma treatment was carried out for the three samples fabricated as above with different treatment times such as 100, 200, and 300 s respectively, by a 200-W remote plasma. A 50-nm-thick Al2O3 film was deposited as a passivation layer by remote plasma atomic layer deposition. The changes in the chemical bonds of the a-IGZO films due to the hydrogen plasma treatment in each device were analyzed using XPS. Additionally, the effective depth of hydrogen plasma was determined using time of flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy\n(TOF-SIMS). The I–V characteristics of hydrogentreated devices were measured at temperatures ranging from 25 to 70 °C with an Agilent B1500 precision semiconductor parameter analyzer (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA). We varied VGS from 10 to 30 V\napplying a VDS of 5 V. Measurement was done in dark, and device temperature was regulated by heated chuck of MSH-1000A temperature controller. TFTs were placed on the heated chuck for 5 min to reach the desired measurement temperature, to set at thermal equilibrium.\nIii. Results And Discussion\nFigures 1(a)–1(d) show the evolution of the I–V transfer characteristic curves as a function of the thermal stress for devices, (i) as deposited (device A), (ii) H2 plasma treated for 100 s (device B), (iii) for 200 s (device C), and (iv) for 300 s (device D), respectively. We varied temperature from 25 (room temperature) to 70 °C. However, only two temperatures of 25 and 40 °C were applied to device D because it already showed serious degradation at these temperatures.\nIn this analysis, we focused on the three important factors of TFT. First, the SS was evaluated. SS is defined as following:\n$$\\mathbf{SS}=\\left[{\\frac{d\\log(I_{\\mathrm{DS}})}{d V_{\\mathrm{GS}}}}\\right]$$\nIt reflects the value of voltage between gate and source\n(VGS) required to obtain a 10 times larger current between drain and source (IDS) in the subthreshold region. The value of SS is dependent on VGS, and small value of SS is advantageous for good device performance. It is related to interface trap charge density, Nit, and bulk trap charge density, Nbulk.\n6 Second, the turn on voltage (Von) was analyzed. Von means the gate voltage when electron accumulation is started between source and drain by turning on gate. The turn on voltage shift, DVon, is affected by various trap in the device, such as interface trap charge, bulk trap charge, and back-channel surface by ambient atmosphere.7 The variation of Von and SS with increasing temperature can be referred to \"stability,\" which is affected by some type of charge rearrangement or generation at or near the gate insulator channel layer. Possible instability mechanisms include (i) electron injection and trapping within gate insulator, (ii) deep state creation, and\n(iii) electron trapping within the IGZO channel layer.8 Therefore, the small variation of Von and SS means good stability. Third, the Ion/Ioff is the ratio of the maximum current and starting off state current, which means the TFT working range, and the larger the Ion/Ioff range, the better the performance. In Fig. 1(a), device A gave the value of SS as 0.34 V/decade, Von as 8.2 V, and the Ion/Ioff ratio of 1.7  107 at room temperature. Changes in these parameters were observed with higher measurement temperatures. The value of SS increased from 0.34 to 0.5 (;0.16 V/decade) and Von shifted negatively from 8.2 to 3.8 (;4.4 V) with increasing measurement temperatures from 25 to 70 °C. Temperature dependence of these parameters could be explained by multiple trapping model as in the case of hydrogenated amorphous silicon TFT.9 At higher temperatures, more electrons can be escaped from localized states and contributed to the free carriers, which caused a higher mobility and smaller turn on voltage. In addition, transfer curve showed two distinct regimes having different slope at a certain temperature condition. It was seen that a part with very steep slope right after the device turned on and another part with moderate slope. It could be regarded as a kind of hump, which was caused by the point defect by process and ambient10,11 or the combination of a dominant transistor and a parasitic transistor.12 In this experiment, hump existed initially by process and then became less significant at higher temperature, suggesting that the detrapping by the Frenkel–Poole type emission became dominant.12 Therefore, it could be thought that initial hump acted as interface trap, which degraded transfer characteristic, and it was in decline at higher temperature. In contrast to device A,\nnotable changes were observed after H2 plasma treatment\nfor device B. Device B showed a value of 0.28 V/decade for SS, V on was 8.0 V, and the I on /I on ratio was 2.3 × 10 ′ at room temperature. A very small change was observed in SS (~0.08 V/decade) and Von (negative shift~ 1.4 V) with the same temperature variation as in sample A. Moreover, device B showed less significant hump than device A.\nInterestingly, another change was observed by longer plasma treatment time as shown in Fig. 1(c) for device C. Device C showed a value of 0.35 V/decade for SS,\n5.0 V for V on , and 2.0 × 10 8 for I on /I off ratio at room temperature. Device C showed a small turn on voltage and large I on /I on ratio at room temperature. However, the value of SS increased (~0.25 V/decade) with increasing temperature. In addition, device C showed serious hump except for 70 °C. Although small turn on voltage and large I on /I off ratio were obtained, stability of device C is worse than that of device B as evident from Fig. 1(c). Device D after the 300-s H 2 plasma treatment showed a serious degradation of the value of SS (2.84 V/decade),\nVon (-9.0 V), and Ion /Ioff ratio (2.0 x 10 6 ) at room temperature. Figure 2 shows an intuitive comparison of the change of (i) SS and (ii) turn on voltage for each device.\nIt was seen that device B, which treated for a 100-s H 2 plasma, has an improved stability, while stability started to decrease for a larger treatment time of 200 s (device C) with increasing measurement temperature. Finally, a serious degradation was observed for a 300-s treatment time for which\n∆ SS and ∆ V on indication was meaningless. Therefore, the change of stability was attributed to hydrogen dose by H 2 plasma treatment, which affected IGZO bulk and IGZO– gate dielectric interface.\nHysteresis was measured for each sample to analyze relationship between transfer characteristic and trap charge with different hydrogen dosing and temperature\n(forward: V G = − 10 to 30 V, reverse: V G = 30 to − 10 V). Figure 3 shows hysteresis loop, and Table I summarizes hysteric behavior for each condition. H 2 plasma treatment 300-s sample was excluded because it showed serious degradation at room temperature. We considered threshold voltage and its shift in hysteresis loops to discuss hysteric\nFIG.  2.  (a) The comparison of subthreshold swing and (b) the comparison of V on negative shift among each device with different H 2 plasma treatment\nbehavior. The symbol of Δ V H was defined as the value of V t shift in hysteresis loops. The initial trap charge at the channel/dielectric interface will influence the hysteric behavior. In addition, a hysteric behavior is easily observed as numbers of traps exist at the channel/dielectric interface by forward/reverse gate voltage sweep. 13 Figures 3(a)–3(c) show the hysteresis loop of each device depending on different hydrogen dosing at 25 (room temperature) and 70 °C. At 25 °C, AVH was about 1.5 V for device A, was about 1 V for device B, and was about 3.7 V for device C.\nBecause the shift of transfer curve in hysteresis loops is attributed to the interface states, AVH change increases with the increasing interface trap density. Thus, the interface trap density was reduced by H 2 plasma treatment 100 s (device B) and was increased by H 2 plasma treatment 200 s (device C), meaning that larger interface trap density leads to inferior SS and hump corresponding to Fig. 1. In Table I, as temperature grew up to 50 °C, ΔVH\nshowed the tendency to decrease in device A and B, which means interface trap sites are occupied with thermally activated carriers. Additionally, although the V on negative shift of device A was increased with higher temperature in Fig. 1, device A showed small AVH with higher temperature in Table I. Hence, the increase of V on negative shift with higher temperature can be considered as the contribution of deep state carrier, which is activated by thermal energy. Contrarily, large AVH was maintained in device C\nwith increasing temperature, which was considered excessive hydrogen act as trap charge at interface. The results imply that the introduction of hydrogen into IGZO layer either reduces or increases the interface trap density and the number of deep state and affects the transfer characteristics of TFTs.\nXPS and TOF-SIMS measurements were performed to find out the quantitative and qualitative chemical property change of a-IGZO film. Samples were prepared in 2 × 2 size under same process condition as mentioned above without Al 2 O 3 passivation layer to focus on relation with a-IGZO and hydrogen. Each sample was sputtered for 600 s to become free from surface contamination such as carbon. The XPS spectrum was calibrated by taking the binding energy of the C 1s peak (285 eV) as a reference.\nThe XPS spectra showed in Fig. 4 indicated the presence of OH 2 groups, which can contribute to the hydrogen concentration. The O 1s peaks were analyzed through a combination of Gaussian (60%) and Lorentzian (40%)\n| TABLE L             |       |       |      |       |       |\n|---------------------|-------|-------|------|-------|-------|\n| Hysteresis ( ΔV H ) | 25 °C | 40 °C | 50°C | 60 °C | 70 °C |\n| As-deposited        | 1.6   | 2.2   | 1    | 1.4   | 1.8   |\n| H 2 plasma 100 s    | 1.2   | 0.8   | 1.4  | 1.4   |       |\n| H 2 plasma 200 s    | 3.8   | 3.4   | 4.5  | 4.3   | 3.2   |\nfitting. The O 1s peaks, which centered at 530.3 eV with a shoulder at 532 eV, could be deconvoluted into three subpeaks. The area ratio was calculated for the three peaks corresponding to the low binding peak (LP), middle binding peak (MP), and high binding peak (HP) centered at around 530.30, 531.41, and 532.45 eV, respectively.\nThe LP at around 530.30 eV was attributed to O 2 − ions surrounded by Zn, Ga, and In atoms in the a-IGZO compound system, which indicated the amount of oxygen atoms in a fully oxidized stoichiometric environment. The MP, centered at around 531.41 eV, was associated with O 2 − ions in the oxygen-deficient regions within the matrix of the a-IGZO and indicated presence of oxygen vacancies. The HP, located at around 532.45 eV, was attributed to surface oxygen species. 14 The relative area percentages of the LP, MP, and HP for the O 1s spectra obtained from a-IGZO films in the all the four cases are listed in Table II.\nThe area ratios of MP/(LP + MP + HP) for devices B, C, and D were found lower than that of device A. The oxygen\nvacancies related to MP acted as an electron donor and supplied free electron carriers in the a-IGZO film and lead to an alteration in the conductivity of the a-IGZO active layer.15,16 In contrast, it should be noted that the area ratios of HP/(LP 1 MP 1 HP) for devices B, C, and D were higher than that of device A. This indicated that H incorporation into the IGZO lattice occurred in the form of hydroxyl group\n(OH) as a result of reaction between (i) reactive H species\n(e.g., radicals and ions) in plasma and (ii) O species bound to metal ions. Kamiya et al. asserted the role of OH groups as a strong n-type donor through their recent study on H-impurity in an a-IGZO.17 asserted the role of OH groups as a strong n-type donor. In our experimental results, we find dependence in saturation current with the H2 plasma treatment. As shown in the Fig. 5, there occurs a decrease in conductivity for 100-s H2 plasma-treated sample from the as-deposited sample. As the H2 plasma treatment time increases, the conductivity increases for 200 and 300 s. This is because initially, hydrogen-passivated oxygen vacancies and then the excess hydrogen contribute to the increased conductivity as explained in the references. Our results substantiated the observation of Kamiya et al. by the fact that the H2 plasma treatment decreased the oxygen vacancies and increased the surface oxygen species as seen from the HP/(LP 1 MP 1 HP) ratio.\n(device A, B, C, and D) for hydrogen. The distribution of\n| TABLE II.

More hydrogen atoms were observed in devices B, C, and D\nthan that of device A. The SIMS depth profiles showed more hydrogen dose for longer H2 plasma treatment in the entire channel layer. Interestingly, a large increase in hydrogen was found in devices C and D unlike XPS\nresult. This is assumed that the hydrogen atoms bonded to oxygen atoms are less in number, while the remaining hydrogen atoms are either chemically attached to other atoms or exist in interstitials. In contrast, SIMS can detect the hydrogen atoms in the whole sample including the metastable hydrogen in the interstitial sites. In addition, the SIMS profile revealed that the H2 penetrates into channel layer down to about 70 nm. The hydrogen atoms increased rapidly over H2 plasma treatment especially for 200 s, and therefore, it was expected that the increased hydrogen dose can have a larger impact on Nbulk and Nit.\nBased on the above experimental results, it is possible to explain the role of hydrogen in a-IGZO. In ZnO-based semiconductor, the conductivity occurs due to three kinds of native donors such as oxygen vacancies, Zn interstitials, and H incorporation.18,19 In addition, Hosono Group reported that some of oxygen vacancies generate free electrons and affect electrical conductivity of a-IGZO\nfilms. Moreover, it was found that most of oxygen deficiencies are deep state, while a small portion of oxygen vacancies are near conduction band minimum (CBM).20 As mentioned above, in our experimental results, asdeposited sample (device A) showed increased DVon and small hysteric behavior with higher temperature. However, H2 plasma treatment for 100 s (device B) showed the decreased DVon and small hysteric behavior with higher temperatures. In the case of H2 plasma treatment for 200 s\n(device C), even though DVon was also decreased, hysteric behavior was increased with serious hump. Finally, a severe\ndegradation was observed in H2 plasma treatment for 300 s\n(device D). Based on the above facts and experimental results, the role of hydrogen atoms in a-IGZO TFTs can be explained as follows. The proper amount of hydrogen atoms could occupy the channel/dielectric interface trap site and deep trap site (device B). This suggests that oxygen vacancies at deep site or near CBM could be passivated by moderate hydrogen dosing. However, surplus amount of hydrogen atoms acted as interstitial defects (device C\nand D). These interstitial defects had bad influence on device stability. Thus, the oxygen vacancies could be affected by H2 plasma treatment and the device stability could be improved by the proper dose of hydrogen atoms.\nLastly, we considered the activation energy (EA) from Arrhenius plots to estimate the contribution of hydrogen atoms to device characteristics in band gap. Negative Von shift with increasing temperatures was explained by the thermal activation process of the subthreshold drain current.21,22 The subthreshold current in amorphous TFT\nhas been well described by the Arrhenius equation,\n$$I_{\\mathrm{DS}}\\approx\\alpha(V_{\\mathrm{GS}}-V_{\\mathrm{TH}})\\exp\\left[\\frac{-E_{\\mathrm{A}}(V_{\\mathrm{GS}})}{k T}\\right]\\ \\ ,$$\nwhere it is assumed that thermally activated electrons from trap sites in the IGZO move into the conduction band of IGZO, which acts as channel through which the electrons move to drain electrode due to the VDS. Hence, the conductance activation energy (EA) was calculated using the thermal excitation of the trapped charge in IGZO\nas a function of VGS from the fitting of the temperaturedependent log(IDS) versus 1/T curve (Fig. 7), where EA 5 EC - EF assuming Boltzmann statistics.23,24 We compared the EA of device A, device B, and device C except for device D because its serious degradation made the comparison meaningless. The maximum EA value (1.84 eV) for device A was observed at a VGS of 8.2 V and then gradually decreased to 0.1 eV at a VGS of 9.8 V. In contrast, energy barrier for device B was approximately 0.93 eV at a VGS of 8.0 V, and EA decreased very rapidly to 0.1 eV at a VGS of 8.6 V. The maximum EA (0.47 eV) for device C was observed at a VGS of 5 V and EA decreased quickly to 0.1 eV at a VGS of 5.4 V. The decrease of EA with respect to VGS in the subthreshold current region should have the same magnitude as the upward shift of EF to conduction band.\nIn the case of a-IGZO TFT having oxygen vacancies and total trap density (Ntotal) including Nbulk and Nit, the variation of EF with respect to VGS(@EF/@VGS) is roughly inversely proportional to the magnitude of oxygen vacancies andNtotal.\nThis is because all the oxygen vacancies and trap sites below EF must be fulfilled with electrons before moving into the EF\nlevel in the forbidden band gap region. In particular, the most significant change of EA was observed near Von for all devices as shown in Fig. 7. In this VGS range near Von, the interfacial traps at a-IGZO/gate dielectric were highly accessible and become major electron trapping source under the accumulation channel mode. Therefore, the energy distribution of interfacial trap states was responsible for the dramatic change in EA near Von in contrast to other VGS region.\nThe decreasing │DEF/DVGS│ ratio (inset of Fig. 7) of device A was about 0.93 eV/V, that of device B was about 2.22 eV/V, and that of device C was about 1.29 eV/V. This indicated that the oxygen vacancies and total traps were reduced by approximately 2.4 times by H2 plasma treatment for 100 s (device B). However, only a decrease of 1.4 times was observed by H2 plasma treatment for 200 s, which was assumed to cause excessive hydrogen atoms, and acted as interstitial defects. Therefore, it was inferred that the proper H2 plasma treatment could lead to the better temperature stability by reducing oxygen vacancy andNtotal at IGZO bulk and the channel/dielectric interface.\nIn this study, we investigated the effect of H2 plasma\ntreatment on a-IGZO film by fabricating devices and treating H2 plasma for different time. The electrical property was measured for all devices by varying temperature. The proper dose of H2 plasma-treated device (device B)\ndemonstrated improved characteristics, i.e., small SS, small negative turn on voltage shift, and small hysteric behavior under thermal stress. However, excessive hydrogen dose by longer treatment time brought about deterioration of device properties, and finally, serious degradation occurred.\nThe incorporation of proper dose of hydrogen, into a-IGZO layer by plasma treatment, passivated not only the oxygen vacancies but also the total traps that existed in channel layer and channel/dielectric interface. However, the higher hydrogen concentrations incorporated into a-IGZO by longer time of H2 plasma treatment acted as interstitial FIG. 7.

This speculation was supported by calculated decreasing rate of activation energy from Arrhenius plots. It was found that the decreasing rate of activation energy was in the same magnitude as of the upward shift of Fermi level to conduction band. This showed that the number of oxygen vacancies and trap sites were decreased in accord with the decreasing rate of the activation energy. Thus, the maximum decreasing rate was observed in proper H2 plasma-treated device. Therefore, our study suggests that the proper dose of H2 plasma treatment can be adopted to control device stability and hydrogen dose should be optimized according to process conditions to get devices with good characteristics."

        "text": "A Study On H2 Plasma Treatment Effect On A-Igzo Thin Film Transistor\nJihoon Kim, Seokhwan Bang, Seungjun Lee, Seokyoon Shin, and Joohyun Park Division of Materials Science and Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul 133-791, Korea Hyungtak Seoa)\nDepartment of Materials Science & Engineering, Ajou University, Woncheon-Dong, Yeongtong-Gu, Suwon 443-739, Korea Hyeongtag Jeonb)\nDivision of Materials Science and Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul 133-791, Korea (Received 4 January 2012; accepted 1 June 2012)\nWe report the effect of H2 plasma treatment on amorphous indium–gallium–zinc–oxide (a-IGZO)\nthin-film transistor (TFT). The changes in electrical characteristics and stability of the a-IGZO TFT\ntreated by H2 plasma were evaluated under thermal stress. Each device exhibited a change in the subthreshold swing, turn on voltage shift, and hysteresis depending on the amount of hydrogen atom. It was found that there occurred a decrease of oxygen deficiency and an increase of hydrogen content in channel layer and channel/dielectric interface with increasing treatment time. The proper hydrogen dose well passivated the oxygen vacancies; however, more hydrogen dose acted as excessive donors. The change of oxygen vacancy and total trap charge were explained by the activation energy from Arrhenius plot. Through this study, we found that the optimized H2 plasma treatment brings device stability by affecting oxygen vacancy and trap content in channel bulk and channel/dielectric interface.\nOver the past 10 years, flat panel display (FPD) has been developed significantly using amorphous and polycrystalline silicon. The success of silicon-based display has contributed to the growth of display industry. Recently, however, its growth based on Si-based FPD seems to be saturated and reaches to the limitation as the new paradigm of displays emerges, and this requires more advanced functionalities and specifications. For instance, the smart devices such as smart phone, tablet PC demand high pixel resolution to zoom in an arbitrary area of screen, and the three-dimensional (3D) display such as 3D TV requires ultra definition pixel resolution and high aperture ratio. Therefore, the current technological specifications require fast, flexible, and transparent display, calling for the use of better display materials than Si. For these reasons, a variety of materials were studied by many groups for next generation display. Among them, amorphous indium–gallium–zinc–oxide (a-IGZO) has been reported to be a good candidate, and a-IGZO thinfilm transistor (TFT) has emerged as a promising solution for high performance backplanes in next generation display because it can provide high mobility, high optical transparency, and applicability for the low-temperature process compared to conventional silicon-based TFT.1,2 To improve the performance of practical a-IGZO applications, most of the studies focused on adjusting process variables such as gas partial pressure, chemical components of a-IGZO, contact resistance, and different plasma treatments. Some research group introduced the effect of hydrogen on the properties of oxide semiconductor.3,4 Additionally, Tsao et al.5 found that the hydrogen-induced passivation of interface trap states between a-IGZO and dielectric layer caused an improvement in subthreshold swing (SS). Even though there are many advantages, it is important to control the hydrogen dose because device stability is sensitive to the amount of hydrogen after plasma treatment. Also, it is important to analyze the role of hydrogen in a-IGZO film.\nTherefore, through this study, we show the change in characteristics of TFT, the role of hydrogen in a-IGZO,\nand the change of oxygen vacancy and trap charge density with the amount of hydrogen dose. We fabricated a-IGZO TFTs with different hydrogen plasma treatment time. Al2O3 passivation layer was deposited to protect the TFT from the ambient atmosphere. Temperature instability test was carried out to examine the electrical property change, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)/ secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) was used to analyze the chemical changes. Based on the Arrhenius equation, the activation energy for devices was calculated, which would account for the change of the oxygen vacancy and trap charge density.\nIi. Experimental Details\nA typical bottom gate-type device structure was used for the fabrication of the a-IGZO TFTs. A thermally grown 100 nm thick SiO2 layer on a p-type Si (1-10 Xcm)\nwas used as substrate in fabricating the TFTs. Si and SiO2 were used as the gate electrode and gate dielectric, respectively. A 70-nm-thick a-IGZO film was deposited to function as active layer by using radio frequency (RF)\nmagnetron sputtering at room temperature. The composition of the a-IGZO target was 1:1:1 mol% of In2O3:Ga2O3:\nZnO. The sputtering was performed with an Ar/O2 gas with a mixing ratio of 54:2, at a RF power of 100 W, and a working pressure of 5.0 mTorr. A liftoff process was used to define the channel patterns, and the channel length\n(L) and width (W) were 200 and 800 lm, respectively.\nAfter deposition of the channel layer, source/drain electrodes of Ti/Au (80/40 nm) were deposited with an e-beam evaporator. All the fabricated devices were annealed in the forming gas ambient at 250 °C for 1 h. Hydrogen plasma treatment was carried out for the three samples fabricated as above with different treatment times such as 100, 200, and 300 s respectively, by a 200-W remote plasma. A 50-nm-thick Al2O3 film was deposited as a passivation layer by remote plasma atomic layer deposition. The changes in the chemical bonds of the a-IGZO films due to the hydrogen plasma treatment in each device were analyzed using XPS. Additionally, the effective depth of hydrogen plasma was determined using time of flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy\n(TOF-SIMS). The I–V characteristics of hydrogentreated devices were measured at temperatures ranging from 25 to 70 °C with an Agilent B1500 precision semiconductor parameter analyzer (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA). We varied VGS from 10 to 30 V\napplying a VDS of 5 V. Measurement was done in dark, and device temperature was regulated by heated chuck of MSH-1000A temperature controller. TFTs were placed on the heated chuck for 5 min to reach the desired measurement temperature, to set at thermal equilibrium.\nIii. Results And Discussion\nFigures 1(a)–1(d) show the evolution of the I–V transfer characteristic curves as a function of the thermal stress for devices, (i) as deposited (device A), (ii) H2 plasma treated for 100 s (device B), (iii) for 200 s (device C), and (iv) for 300 s (device D), respectively. We varied temperature from 25 (room temperature) to 70 °C. However, only two temperatures of 25 and 40 °C were applied to device D because it already showed serious degradation at these temperatures.\nIn this analysis, we focused on the three important factors of TFT. First, the SS was evaluated. SS is defined as following:\n$$\\overline{{d V_{\\mathrm{GS}}}}$$\nSs ¼ D Logðidsþ Dvgs  1:\nIt reflects the value of voltage between gate and source\n(VGS) required to obtain a 10 times larger current between drain and source (IDS) in the subthreshold region. The value of SS is dependent on VGS, and small value of SS is advantageous for good device performance. It is related to interface trap charge density, Nit, and bulk trap charge density, Nbulk.\n6 Second, the turn on voltage (Von) was analyzed. Von means the gate voltage when electron accumulation is started between source and drain by turning on gate. The turn on voltage shift, DVon, is affected by various trap in the device, such as interface trap charge, bulk trap charge, and back-channel surface by ambient atmosphere.7 The variation of Von and SS with increasing temperature can be referred to \"stability,\" which is affected by some type of charge rearrangement or generation at or near the gate insulator channel layer. Possible instability mechanisms include (i) electron injection and trapping within gate insulator, (ii) deep state creation, and\n(iii) electron trapping within the IGZO channel layer.8 Therefore, the small variation of Von and SS means good stability. Third, the Ion/Ioff is the ratio of the maximum current and starting off state current, which means the TFT working range, and the larger the Ion/Ioff range, the better the performance. In Fig. 1(a), device A gave the value of SS as 0.34 V/decade, Von as 8.2 V, and the Ion/Ioff ratio of 1.7  107 at room temperature. Changes in these parameters were observed with higher measurement temperatures. The value of SS increased from 0.34 to 0.5 (;0.16 V/decade) and Von shifted negatively from 8.2 to 3.8 (;4.4 V) with increasing measurement temperatures from 25 to 70 °C. Temperature dependence of these parameters could be explained by multiple trapping model as in the case of hydrogenated amorphous silicon TFT.9 At higher temperatures, more electrons can be escaped from localized states and contributed to the free carriers, which caused a higher mobility and smaller turn on voltage. In addition, transfer curve showed two distinct regimes having different slope at a certain temperature condition. It was seen that a part with very steep slope right after the device turned on and another part with moderate slope. It could be regarded as a kind of hump, which was caused by the point defect by process and ambient10,11 or the combination of a dominant transistor and a parasitic transistor.12 In this experiment, hump existed initially by process and then became less significant at higher temperature, suggesting that the detrapping by the Frenkel–Poole type emission became dominant.12 Therefore, it could be thought that initial hump acted as interface trap, which degraded transfer characteristic, and it was in decline at higher temperature. In contrast to device A,\nnotable changes were observed after H2 plasma treatment\nfor device B. Device B showed a value of 0.28 V/decade for SS, V on was 8.0 V, and the I on /I on ratio was 2.3 × 10 7 at room temperature. A very small change was observed in SS (~0.08 V/decade) and Von (negative shift~1.4 V) with the same temperature variation as in sample A. Moreover, device B showed less significant hump than device A.\nInterestingly, another change was observed by longer plasma treatment time as shown in Fig. 1(c) for device C. Device C showed a value of 0.35 V/decade for SS,\n5.0 V for Von, and 2.0 × 10 8 for Ion /Ioff ratio at room temperature. Device C showed a small turn on voltage and large I on /I off ratio at room temperature. However, the value of SS increased (~0.25 V/decade) with increasing temperature. In addition, device C showed serious hump except for 70 °C. Although small turn on voltage and large I on /I off ratio were obtained, stability of device C is worse than that of device B as evident from Fig. 1(c). Device D after the 300-s H 2 plasma treatment showed a serious degradation of the value of SS (2.84 V/decade),\nVon ( 9.0 V), and Ion/Ioff ratio (2.0 × 10 6 ) at room temperature. Figure 2 shows an intuitive comparison of the change of (i) SS and (ii) turn on voltage for each device.\nIt was seen that device B, which treated for a 100-s H 2 plasma, has an improved stability, while stability started to decrease for a larger treatment time of 200 s (device C) with increasing measurement temperature. Finally, a serious degradation was observed for a 300-s treatment time for which ∆ SS and ∆ V on indication was meaningless. Therefore, the change of stability was attributed to hydrogen dose by H 2 plasma treatment, which affected IGZO bulk and IGZO–\ngate dielectric interface.\nHysteresis was measured for each sample to analyze relationship between transfer characteristic and trap charge with different hydrogen dosing and temperature (forward: V G = − 10 to 30 V, reverse: V G = 30 to − 10 V).\nFigure 3 shows hysteresis loop, and Table I summarizes hysteric behavior for each condition. H 2 plasma treatment 300-s sample was excluded because it showed serious degradation at room temperature. We considered threshold voltage and its shift in hysteresis loops to discuss hysteric J. Mater. Res., Vol. 27, No. 17, Sep 14, 2012.\nbehavior. The symbol of AVH was defined as the value of V T shift in hysteresis loops. The initial trap charge at the channel/dielectric interface will influence the hysteric behavior. In addition, a hysteric behavior is easily observed as numbers of traps exist at the channel/dielectric interface by forward/reverse gate voltage sweep. 13 Figures 3(a)–3(c) show the hysteresis loop of each device depending on different hydrogen dosing at 25 (room temperature)\nand 70 °C. At 25 °C, AVH was about 1.5 V for device A, was about 1 V for device B, and was about 3.7 V for device C.\nBecause the shift of transfer curve in hysteresis loops is attributed to the interface states, AVH change increases with the increasing interface trap density. Thus, the interface trap density was reduced by H 2 plasma treatment 100 s (device B) and was increased by H 2 plasma treatment 200 s (device C), meaning that larger interface trap density leads to inferior SS and hump corresponding to Fig. 1. In Table I, as temperature grew up to 50 °C, AVH showed the tendency to decrease in device A and B, which means interface trap sites are occupied with thermally activated carriers. Additionally, although the Von negative shift of device A was increased with higher temperature in Fig. 1, device A showed small AVH with higher temperature in Table I. Hence, the increase of Von negative shift with higher temperature can be considered as the contribution of deep state carrier, which is activated by thermal energy. Contrarily, large Δ V H was maintained in device C\nwith increasing temperature, which was considered excessive hydrogen act as trap charge at interface. The results imply that the introduction of hydrogen into IGZO layer either reduces or increases the interface trap density and the number of deep state and affects the transfer characteristics of TFTs.\nXPS and TOF-SIMS measurements were performed to find out the quantitative and qualitative chemical property change of a-IGZO film. Samples were prepared in 2 × 2 size under same process condition as mentioned above without Al 2 O 3 passivation layer to focus on relation with a-IGZO and hydrogen. Each sample was sputtered for 600 s to become free from surface contamination such as carbon. The XPS spectrum was calibrated by taking the binding energy of the C 1s peak (285 eV) as a reference.\nThe XPS spectra showed in Fig. 4 indicated the presence of OH 2 groups, which can contribute to the hydrogen concentration. The O 1s peaks were analyzed through a combination of Gaussian (60%) and Lorentzian (40%)\n| Hysteresis ( ΔVH )   | 25 °C   | 40 °C   | 50°C   | 60 °C   | 70 °C   |\n|----------------------|---------|---------|--------|---------|---------|\n| As-deposited         | 1.6     | 2.2     | 1.4    | 1.8     |         |\n| H 2 plasma 100 s     | 1.2     | 0.8     | 1.4    | 1.4     |         |\n| H 2 plasma 200 s     | 3.8     | 3.4     | 4.5    | 4.3     | 3.2     |\nfitting. The O 1s peaks, which centered at 530.3 eV with a shoulder at 532 eV, could be deconvoluted into three subpeaks. The area ratio was calculated for the three peaks corresponding to the low binding peak (LP), middle binding peak (MP), and high binding peak (HP) centered at around 530.30, 531.41, and 532.45 eV, respectively.\nThe LP at around 530.30 eV was attributed to O 2 2 ions surrounded by Zn, Ga, and In atoms in the a-IGZO compound system, which indicated the amount of oxygen atoms in a fully oxidized stoichiometric environment. The MP, centered at around 531.41 eV, was associated with 02ions in the oxygen-deficient regions within the matrix of the a-IGZO and indicated presence of oxygen vacancies. The HP, located at around 532.45 eV, was attributed to surface oxygen species. 14 The relative area percentages of the LP, MP, and HP for the O 1s spectra obtained from a-IGZO films in the all the four cases are listed in Table II.\nThe area ratios of MP/(LP + MP + HP) for devices B, C, and D were found lower than that of device A. The oxygen\nvacancies related to MP acted as an electron donor and supplied free electron carriers in the a-IGZO film and lead to an alteration in the conductivity of the a-IGZO active layer.15,16 In contrast, it should be noted that the area ratios of HP/(LP 1 MP 1 HP) for devices B, C, and D were higher than that of device A. This indicated that H incorporation into the IGZO lattice occurred in the form of hydroxyl group\n(OH) as a result of reaction between (i) reactive H species\n(e.g., radicals and ions) in plasma and (ii) O species bound to metal ions. Kamiya et al. asserted the role of OH groups as a strong n-type donor through their recent study on H-impurity in an a-IGZO.17 asserted the role of OH groups as a strong n-type donor. In our experimental results, we find dependence in saturation current with the H2 plasma treatment. As shown in the Fig. 5, there occurs a decrease in conductivity for 100-s H2 plasma-treated sample from the as-deposited sample. As the H2 plasma treatment time increases, the conductivity increases for 200 and 300 s. This is because initially, hydrogen-passivated oxygen vacancies and then the excess hydrogen contribute to the increased conductivity as explained in the references. Our results substantiated the observation of Kamiya et al. by the fact that the H2 plasma treatment decreased the oxygen vacancies and increased the surface oxygen species as seen from the HP/(LP 1 MP 1 HP) ratio.\n(device A, B, C, and D) for hydrogen.

More hydrogen atoms were observed in devices B, C, and D\nthan that of device A. The SIMS depth profiles showed more hydrogen dose for longer H2 plasma treatment in the entire channel layer. Interestingly, a large increase in hydrogen was found in devices C and D unlike XPS\nresult. This is assumed that the hydrogen atoms bonded to oxygen atoms are less in number, while the remaining hydrogen atoms are either chemically attached to other atoms or exist in interstitials. In contrast, SIMS can detect the hydrogen atoms in the whole sample including the metastable hydrogen in the interstitial sites. In addition, the SIMS profile revealed that the H2 penetrates into channel layer down to about 70 nm. The hydrogen atoms increased rapidly over H2 plasma treatment especially for 200 s, and therefore, it was expected that the increased hydrogen dose can have a larger impact on Nbulk and Nit.\nBased on the above experimental results, it is possible to explain the role of hydrogen in a-IGZO. In ZnO-based semiconductor, the conductivity occurs due to three kinds of native donors such as oxygen vacancies, Zn interstitials, and H incorporation.18,19 In addition, Hosono Group reported that some of oxygen vacancies generate free electrons and affect electrical conductivity of a-IGZO\nfilms. Moreover, it was found that most of oxygen deficiencies are deep state, while a small portion of oxygen vacancies are near conduction band minimum (CBM).20 As mentioned above, in our experimental results, asdeposited sample (device A) showed increased DVon and small hysteric behavior with higher temperature. However, H2 plasma treatment for 100 s (device B) showed the decreased DVon and small hysteric behavior with higher temperatures. In the case of H2 plasma treatment for 200 s\n(device C), even though DVon was also decreased, hysteric behavior was increased with serious hump. Finally, a severe\ndegradation was observed in H2 plasma treatment for 300 s\n(device D). Based on the above facts and experimental results, the role of hydrogen atoms in a-IGZO TFTs can be explained as follows. The proper amount of hydrogen atoms could occupy the channel/dielectric interface trap site and deep trap site (device B). This suggests that oxygen vacancies at deep site or near CBM could be passivated by moderate hydrogen dosing. However, surplus amount of hydrogen atoms acted as interstitial defects (device C\nand D). These interstitial defects had bad influence on device stability. Thus, the oxygen vacancies could be affected by H2 plasma treatment and the device stability could be improved by the proper dose of hydrogen atoms.\nLastly, we considered the activation energy (EA) from Arrhenius plots to estimate the contribution of hydrogen atoms to device characteristics in band gap. Negative Von shift with increasing temperatures was explained by the thermal activation process of the subthreshold drain current.21,22 The subthreshold current in amorphous TFT\nhas been well described by the Arrhenius equation,\n$$I_{\\mathrm{DS}}\\approx\\alpha(V_{\\mathrm{GS}}-V_{\\mathrm{TH}})\\exp\\left[\\frac{-E_{\\mathrm{A}}(V_{\\mathrm{GS}})}{k T}\\right]~~~,$$\nwhere it is assumed that thermally activated electrons from trap sites in the IGZO move into the conduction band of IGZO, which acts as channel through which the electrons move to drain electrode due to the VDS. Hence, the conductance activation energy (EA) was calculated using the thermal excitation of the trapped charge in IGZO\nas a function of VGS from the fitting of the temperaturedependent log(IDS) versus 1/T curve (Fig. 7), where EA 5 EC  EF assuming Boltzmann statistics.23,24 We compared the EA of device A, device B, and device C except for device D because its serious degradation made the comparison meaningless. The maximum EA value (1.84 eV) for device A was observed at a VGS of 8.2 V and then gradually decreased to 0.1 eV at a VGS of 9.8 V. In contrast, energy barrier for device B was approximately 0.93 eV at a VGS of 8.0 V, and EA decreased very rapidly to 0.1 eV at a VGS of 8.6 V. The maximum EA (0.47 eV) for device C was observed at a VGS of 5 V and EA decreased quickly to 0.1 eV\nat a VGS of 5.4 V. The decrease of EA with respect to VGS in the subthreshold current region should have the same magnitude as the upward shift of EF to conduction band.\nIn the case of a-IGZO TFT having oxygen vacancies and total trap density (Ntotal) including Nbulk and Nit, the variation of EF with respect to VGS(@EF/@VGS) is roughly inversely proportional to the magnitude of oxygen vacancies andNtotal.\nThis is because all the oxygen vacancies and trap sites below EF must be fulfilled with electrons before moving into the EF\nlevel in the forbidden band gap region. In particular, the most significant change of EA was observed near Von for all devices as shown in Fig. 7. In this VGS range near Von, the interfacial traps at a-IGZO/gate dielectric were highly accessible and become major electron trapping source under the accumulation channel mode. Therefore, the energy distribution of interfacial trap states was responsible for the dramatic change in EA near Von in contrast to other VGS region.\nThe decreasing │DEF/DVGS│ ratio (inset of Fig. 7) of device A was about 0.93 eV/V, that of device B was about 2.22 eV/V, and that of device C was about 1.29 eV/V. This indicated that the oxygen vacancies and total traps were reduced by approximately 2.4 times by H2 plasma treatment for 100 s (device B). However, only a decrease of 1.4 times was observed by H2 plasma treatment for 200 s, which was assumed to cause excessive hydrogen atoms, and acted as interstitial defects. Therefore, it was inferred that the proper H2 plasma treatment could lead to the better temperature stability by reducing oxygen vacancy andNtotal at IGZO bulk and the channel/dielectric interface.\nIn this study, we investigated the effect of H2 plasma\ntreatment on a-IGZO film by fabricating devices and treating H2 plasma for different time. The electrical property was measured for all devices by varying temperature. The proper dose of H2 plasma-treated device (device B)\ndemonstrated improved characteristics, i.e., small SS, small negative turn on voltage shift, and small hysteric behavior under thermal stress. However, excessive hydrogen dose by longer treatment time brought about deterioration of device properties, and finally, serious degradation occurred.\nThe incorporation of proper dose of hydrogen, into a-IGZO\nlayer by plasma treatment, passivated not only the oxygen vacancies but also the total traps that existed in channel layer and channel/dielectric interface. However, the higher hydrogen concentrations incorporated into a-IGZO by longer time of H2 plasma treatment acted as interstitial FIG. 7. The variation of the activation energy (EA) of the IDS vs. VGS for as-deposited, H2 plasma treated for 100 s, and H2 plasma treated for 200 s.\ndefects rather than the passivating role. This speculation was supported by calculated decreasing rate of activation energy from Arrhenius plots. It was found that the decreasing rate of activation energy was in the same magnitude as of the upward shift of Fermi level to conduction band. This showed that the number of oxygen vacancies and trap sites were decreased in accord with the decreasing rate of the activation energy. Thus, the maximum decreasing rate was observed in proper H2 plasma-treated device. Therefore, our study suggests that the proper dose of H2 plasma treatment can be adopted to control device stability and hydrogen dose should be optimized according to process conditions to get devices with good characteristics."

The degraded performance of IGZO-TFTs after the DCD phenomenon was related to the charge trapping and modification of the electronic structure by collision of an IGZO matrix with hot carriers.\nIGZO-TFTs; Hot carrier effect; **Drain current drop phenomenon;** Electronic structure; band edge state. \n1. Introduction\nOver the past decade, oxide semiconductor thin film transistors (Ox-TFTs) have attracted considerable attention as a switching and driving devices for the backplane technology of the organic light-emitting diode (OLED) premium display due to high mobility (> 10 cm2/Vs), low off-current (<10-12**A), low-cost**\nprocess, and scalability exceeding generation-8 glass substrate\n. Despite the various merits of oxide semiconductors as mentioned above, for a display application of the switching and driving device, higher device performance and device instability still remain the most important and critical issues, including instability under gate bias and temperature stress (BTS)  and gate bias and light illumination stress (BIS) . In addition, the charge-trapping effect of the interface between the oxide semiconductor and the gate insulator has been widely studied to solve the degradation mechanism during the active-matrix organic light-Emitting diode (AMOLED) pixel operating conditions . However, further analysis of other considerations, such as a drain bias induced hot carrier effect, is required to better understand the degradation behavior in practical operation conditions. It has been already well established that the hot carrier effect in a silicon-based device such as a metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor\n(MOSFET), and a low temperature poly-crystalline-silicon (LTPS). The generated hot carriers on a Si-based device cause impact ionization and hot carrier injection into interface between the semiconductor and the gate insulator caused by collision of lattice with hot carriers **due to the small band gap (~1.1 eV) of** Si, and which can be increased the drain current (kink effect) and gate leakage current . However, in the oxide semiconductor based device, it is difficult to generate an impact ionization due to a wide band gap (>3 eV), so that is occurred different phenomenon from the Si-based device, which cannot be explained by hot carrier effect known for a Si-based device. In this paper, to understand the most plausible origin of the drain current drop phenomenon by hot carrier effect in IGZO-TFTs, we systemically investigated the correlation between the device performance before and after drain current drop phenomenon and changed physical properties of the IGZO active layer. In addition, we tried to extract physical properties of the IGZO active layer at actual TFT device structures, to avoid a mismatch between an actual TFT device and a thin film. Therefore, the origin of drain current drop phenomenon under low gate bias has been clearly identified and these results can reflect the device characteristics. \n2. Experimental Details 2.1 Fabrication Procedures Of Igzo-Tfts\nIn Figure 1(a) IGZO-TFTs were fabricated on a glass substrate \n. The buffer layer (SiO2**) and 30-nm-thick active channel** \nlayer (In:Ga:Zn= 1:1:1 at.**%) were deposited by plasmaenhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) at the working** \ntemperature with reactant gases and a DC sputtering system without substrate heating, respectively. The IGZO active channel layer area was defined using a photolithography technique. After deposition and patterning of the gate electrode, source/drain extension regions are self-aligned to the gate and are formed by dry-etching the exposed IGZO surface. The gate insulator layer (SiO2**) was deposited by PECVD and patterned to** \nform source/drain contact holes. Finally, **IGZO-TFTs undergo** \nthermal annealing treatments to achieve uniform and stable device performance. \n2.2 Device Analysis\nThe transfer characteristic of IGZO-TFTs was measured at VDS = \n0.1 V, and 10 V using a semiconductor parameter analyzer (Keithley 4200S). The capacitance-voltage (C-V**) characteristic** was evaluated at 500 kHz by precision LCR Meter (Keysight E4980A). Especially, the CGS-VG and CGD-VG **curves were** \nmeasured on a floating condition of the drain and source, respectively. Moreover, the change of sub-gap density-of-states (DOS) was investigated using the monochromatic photonic C-V\n(MPCV) technique . To verify established DCD mechanism based on experimental results, we performed the Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD) simulations that confirm the electrical field distributions in channels and reproduce the transfer characteristics. \n2.3 Physical Property Analysis Of Igzo-Tfts\nTo investigate the changes on the physical properties of IGZO \nactive layers according to the DCD phenomenon, before and after DCD phenomenon analysis samples were prepared using a focused ion beam (FIB, Quanta 3D, FEI). The exact thickness and structure of active layer were investigated using a transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-ARM200F, \nJEOL) mode and scanning TEM mode at 200 kV. The unoccupied hybrid state of IGZO active layers was analyzed by O K-edge spectra using electron energy loss spectroscopy \n(EELS, GIF965-ER, JEOL) at 80 kV. In particular, the analysis area was determined through TEM images in order to perform the analysis concentrated on the IGZO layer nearby the drain where the change of properties was expected. \n3. Results And Discussion \n![1_Image_0.Png](1_Image_0.Png)\nvoltage was increased to 47.4 V, the drain current was linearly increased. This effect is commonly observed in silicon-based TFT  as well as in an IGZO TFT (normally for L < 6 μm)  when the channel length is reduced. This non-saturation is associated with the channel length modulation which accounts for the drain current increase resulted from the shrinking channel length with the application of drain voltage in excess of the saturation drain-to-source voltage. However, at the drain voltage over 47.4 V (critical voltage, Vcrit.**), the drain current was** \ndropped momentarily. After the DCD phenomenon, the threshold voltage (Vth**) of a transfer curve was dramatically** \nshifted to a positive direction with the sub-threshold swing (SS) \nand field effect mobility (μeff**) degradation as shown in Fig. 1(c).** \nThese can imply that simply electron charge trapping model is not enough to explain the DCD phenomenon . Especially, based on results of recovery test for a month, we have confirmed that the damage of the IGZO-TFT is permanent after DCD \nphenomenon. (Less than 36 % based on Vth **recovery, not shown** \nhere). Furthermore, it was a critical difference between the CGSVG and CGD-VG **characteristics that the obvious hump appears in** \nthe CGS-VG **curve but a flat band shift to positive direction with** \nhysteresis in CGD-VG **curve as shown in Fig. 1(d). This shift of a** flat band which accompanies with hysteresis in CGD-VG **means** \nthat a charge trapping and defect creation occurred together either in an active layer or at interfaces . Moreover, this result was related with asymmetric degradation in the direction of channel length, which was degradation at nearby the drain. It was found through the TCAD simulation that when the Vcrit **was** \napplied to the drain, the distribution of the electric field was concentrated in the active region nearby the drain, as shown in Fig. 1 (a). The electrons can reach very high energy particles due to the abrupt changes of electric fields at the end of the channel, and become hot carrier. The generated hot carriers also produce the collision damage into the IGZO matrix, which can generate the DCD phenomenon as shown in Fig. 1 (b). More discussion is provided below and we consider the changes of physical properties of IGZO active layers by the DCD \nphenomenon to the hot carrier effect. \n| Parameter              | Unit     | Initial   | After DCD   |       |\n|------------------------|----------|-----------|-------------|-------|\n| Vth                    | V        | 0.09      | 11.4        |       |\n| Electrical  Parameters | μeff,lin | cm2 /Vs   | 8.3         | 0.7   |\n| SS                     | V/dec    | 0.05      | 0.235       |       |\n| ION/IOFF               | 1.24x109 | 5.95x107  |             |       |\n| NTA                    | eV-1cm-3 | 2x1018    | 2x1020      |       |\n| DOS                    |          |           |             |       |\n| parameters             | kTTA     | eV        | 0.025       | 0.035 |\n| NDA                    | eV-1cm-3 | 1.5x1017  | 1.5x1017    |       |\n| kTDA                   | eV       | 0.33      | 0.33        |       |\nFigure 2 (a) shows the extracted sub-gap DOS before and after the DCD phenomenon using the MPCV technique. It can be seen that there is a noticeable increase in sub-gap DOS \nnearby the conduction band minimum (EC**). Based on the** \nexperimental results including the electrical parameters and extracted DOS referred in Table 1, we performed the TCAD simulation that reflected the mobility degradation caused by defect creations and the positive shift due to the electron trapping. Figure 2(b) shows the result of TCAD simulation, which accurately reproduced the DCD phenomenon. Therefore, it can be reasonably deduced that the change of the transfer characteristics of IGZO-TFTs after the DCD phenomenon is a combination of a defect creation and an electron trapping. \nConsidering the C-V characteristics in Fig. 1 (d), the degradation region of the IGZO active layer after the DCD phenomenon can be assumed to nearby the drain. Therefore, TEM and EELS\nanalysis of IGZO active layers before and after the DCD\nphenomenon were performed at nearby the drain. The significant physical changes of IGZO active layers before and after the DCD\nphenomenon was not observed through the TEM analysis (not shown here). However, the unoccupied hybridized states of IGZO\nactive layers before and after the DCD phenomenon were dramatically changed. Figure 3(a) shows the normalized O- K edge spectra of an IGZO active layer measured by EELS analysis, which provides the unoccupied hybridized states of In 5sp , Ga 4p ,\nZn 4 sp , and O 2 p by the transition of the electron from the occupied O 1s state  and co-plots the O- K edge spectra of each binary oxide (In 2 O 3 , ZnO, and Ga 2 O 3 ) for easy comparison with the changes in the unoccupied hybridized states of IGZO active layers. The unoccupied hybridized states of IGZO after the DCD\nphenomenon have a clearly different feature and significantly decreased at an energy loss region from 537.5 eV to 539.5 eV. In addition, the O-K edge spectrum of binary ZnO is located in the strong resonance peak at 538.6 eV. Based on the position of the strong resonance peak of ZnO, the change in the unoccupied hybridized states of IGZO after the DCD phenomenon could be attributing to the decrease in the Zn-O bond.\nTo interpret the change of the unoccupied hybridized states before and after the DCD phenomenon as the change of the relative ratio of the each binary oxide, the simulation of the unoccupied hybridized state of an IGZO active layer using a combinatorial electronic structure was performed.\nThe simulation of the combinatorial electronic structure means there is a superposition with the experimental O- K edge spectrum of each binary oxide in Fig. 3(a). Based on the simulation results, the relative area ratio of In-O, Ga-O, and Zn-O in the IGZO\nmatrix before the DCD phenomenon was 29 %, 23 % and 48 %,\nrespectively. The interesting finding is that, the relative ratio of Zn-O in the IGZO matrix was dramically decreased to 35 %\nafter the DCD phenomenon as shown in Figs. 3(b) and 3(c).\n| oxide in IGZO matrix   |                        |                    |\n|------------------------|------------------------|--------------------|\n| Bond dissociation      | Dissociation energy of |                    |\n| Bond                   | energy (kJ/mol)        | diatomic bond (eV) |\n| Zn-O                   | <250                   | <2.59              |\n| 3.59  .31              |                        |                    |\n| In-O                   | 346  30                |                    |\n| Ga-O                   | 374 721                | 3.8870.22          |\nIn addition, as can be seen in table 2, among the three metals such as In, Ga and Zn in the IGZO matrix, Zn is the weakest metal binding to oxygen . This result implys that the bond of Zn-O can be easliy broken after the DCD phenomenon by collision of an IGZO matrix with hot carriers. Moreover, significant changes in the O-K edge spectra after the DCD\nphenomenon are also observed in the band edge state as shown in Figs. 3(d) and 3(e). Before the DCD phenomenon, the one band edge state ( DI ) below the conduction band was observed.\nHowever, the band edge states were clearly identified two distinct band edge states ( D1 and D2 ) as well as an increased state in D1 after the DCD phenomenon. Considering the increased state of extracted sub-gap DOS in Fig. 2 (a), this increase in a band edge state is a reasonable trend after the DCD phenomenon.\nFigure 4 shows a schematic illustration of the degradation mechanism of the DCD phenomenon by collision of an IGZO matrix with hot carriers. The generated hot carriers that are momentarily accelerated by the concentrated electric field at nearby the drain preferentially break Zn-O bond, what is the weakest bond in an IGZO matrix. The broken Zn-O bond by hot carrier effect forms electron trap sites, Zn (+/0) and O (-/0). \nEspecially, O (-/0) can trap the hole by releasing electrons taken from metal, but the probability of actually acting as a trap site is very low due to the large excited energy from the oxygen ion to the conduction band. On the other hand, since Zn can trap an electron in an empty 4s **state and easily de-trap it, the Zn+ state** affects an electron transport as an acceptor like a trap. \n4. Conclusion\nIn summary, to understand the drain current drop phenomenon by hot carrier effect in IGZO-TFTs, we systemically investigated the correlation between the device performance and the changed physical properties of IGZO active layers with actual TFT device structures. After the DCD phenomenon, the device performances such as μeff, Vth, and SS **were significantly** \ndegraded, compared to the initial IGZO-TFT. This remarkable degradation of device performance was strongly associated with the break of the weakest Zn-O bond in an IGZO matrix by collision with hot carriers. The broken Zn-O bond forms an acceptor like an electron trap site, which could degrade the electron transport. In addition, an increase in the relative area of band edge states below the conduction band is considered as the dominant mechanism responsible for the drain current drop phenomenon under low gate voltage and high drain voltage of IGZO-TFTs.

However, given its research solely focuses on improving electrical performance, its practical use faces limitations due to an insufficient comprehension of its influence on device reliability - a pivotal factor for optimal, long-term device operation. Herein, improvements in the electrical performance and reliability of highly transparent amorphous indium-gallium-tin-oxide (a-IGTO) \nTFTs through SF6 plasma treatment, a facile and straightforward approach with high applicability, are thoroughly investigated. Furthermore, the addition of oxygen gas, a widely used supplementary gas in plasma treatment, is analyzed. The diffusion of S and F by SF6 plasma treatment breaks the weak bonds between the metal ions and oxygen atoms and reduces the number of oxygen vacancies in a-IGTO thin films. Despite the decrease in the oxygen vacancies, the carrier concentration is increased, as F acts as a donor-like defect. This diffused S and F effect increased the field-effect mobility (μ, 19.4 cm2/V⋅s) by a factor of about two and also greatly reduced the threshold voltage (Vth) shifts under various bias stress tests. The high performance and reliability of SF6 plasma-treated a-IGTO TFTs demonstrate the feasibility of transparent TFT-based next-generation transparent electronics. \nAOS-based TFTs arise under light illumination, voltage bias, and elevated temperatures [9–12]. Several attempts have been made to resolve these uniformity and reliability issues, including high-pressure annealing, cation doping, the implementation of passivation layers, and plasma treatment [13–16]. Among these methods, plasma treatment has gained considerable attention for its minimal waste production, low-pressure gas phase operation, and rapid, facile fabrication process \n. Furthermore, various types of surface modifications, including etching, grafting, polymerization, deposition, and implantation, can be readily tailored by selecting the appropriate gas used to generate the plasma during the treatment processes [19–21]. Thus far, plasma treatments utilizing gases such as carbon tetrafluoride (CF4) and O2 have contributed to improving the electrical properties of AOS-based TFTs; however, comprehensive investigations into their effects on the uniformity and reliability of these devices, which are critical to proper device Amorphous oxide semiconductors (AOS) have attracted significant attention as viable semiconducting materials capable of replacing hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) and organic semiconductors in next-generation electronics such as transparent displays, neuromorphic computing, and soft electronics [1–4].

Sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) is a readily available, inexpensive fluorocontaining gas commonly used in many industrial processes, notably as an etching gas in plasma treatment . Recently, it has garnered interest as a cost-effective doping agent in plasma treatment for AOS-based TFTs. Although previous studies have examined the electrical properties of fluorine-doped AOS thin films, the integration of AOS \nthin films plasma-treated with SF6 gas into fully operational TFTs as a high-performance and reliable channel layer remains unexplored. The introduction of fluorine (F) serves to diminish the presence of oxygen vacancies and charge traps within the AOS channel layer, thus assuming a pivotal role in achieving improved electrical characteristics and reliability of AOS-based TFTs . This beneficial influence of F not only reduces the scattering of conduction electrons but also increases the transparency of the thin film, rendering it exceptionally suitable for use in transparent electronics . Furthermore, F is known to act as a donor-like defect by donating a free electron upon bonding with either metal or oxygen atoms, thereby increasing the carrier concentration . In contrast, the presence of sulfur (S) in AOS thin films leads to in-bandgap defects and charge traps, resulting in a very high resistance similar to that of amorphous chalcogenides (a-Se, and a-S) . Nonetheless, despite the divergent effects of S and F, the SF6 plasma treatment of AOS thin films can be effectively controlled through the fabrication process. By performing the activation annealing process prior to the SF6 plasma treatment, the diffusion of F into the AOS thin films can be significantly improved to increase the carrier concentration . Therefore, it is important to perform precise control over the diffusion of S and F in AOS thin films to enhance the electrical performance and reliability of AOS-based TFTs. \nIn this work, we present a straightforward and effective method for improving both electrical characteristics and reliability of transparent amorphous indium-gallium-tin-oxide (a-IGTO) TFTs through SF6 plasma treatment. Additionally, we examine the mechanisms behind S and F diffusion, thereby contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the observed improvements in the device performance and reliability. The addition of O2 gas, a supplementary gas widely used in conjunction with various primary gases in plasma treatment, was also conducted and analyzed. To evaluate the effect of the added O2 gas, we performed a comparative analysis of the electrical characteristics of a-IGTO TFTs under two conditions wherein SF6 gas was either supplied simultaneously with or supplied without O2 gas altogether during the plasma treatment. Furthermore, we conducted positive bias stress (PBS), negative bias stress (NBS), and negative bias illumination stress (NBIS) tests and analyzed the resulting shifts in the threshold voltage (Vth) to investigate the bias stability and overall reliability of the SF6 plasmatreated a-IGTO TFTs. The physical and chemical analyses using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and crosssectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were conducted to analyze the channel layer components, degree of S and F diffusion in the channel layer, surface morphology, and vertical structure, respectively. \nThe SF6 plasma-treated a-IGTO TFTs, as presented in this study, have demonstrated exceptional transparency and substantially improved electrical performance and reliability, thus offering significant promise for the advancement of next-generation transparent electronics. \n2. **Results And Discussion**\nTo evaluate the effect of the SF6 plasma treatment, top-contact bottom-gate (TCBG) a-IGTO TFTs were fabricated (Fig. 1a). After depositing a-IGTO on a Si-wafer (Si/SiO2) as a channel layer, activation annealing was performed. The annealed a-IGTO thin films were subjected to SF6 plasma treatment, either with or without O2 gas during the treatment process. Finally, Al was deposited as the source/drain (S/D) electrode on the SF6 plasma-treated a-IGTO channel layer. A total of 12 samples were fabricated for each specific fabrication condition and subjected to a comparative analysis of their device properties. Detailed information regarding device fabrication and SF6 plasma treatment conditions are described in the Experimental Section. During the fabrication of the SF6 plasma-treated a-IGTO channel layer, activation annealing was performed prior to the plasma treatment to enhance the diffusion of F in the channel layer. Several studies on AOS-based TFTs have reported that while S can play a positive role in improving the electrical properties and reliability, it can also act as charge traps in amorphous indiumgallium-zinc-oxide thin films and increase the bulk resistance . \nConducting SF6 plasma treatment prior to activation annealing resulted in a low concentration of F and a high concentration of S in the a-IGTO \nthin film, exhibiting a significantly increased resistance of the channel layer. However, performing SF6 plasma treatment after activation annealing significantly increased the concentration of F, resulting in an increased carrier concentration in the channel layer. \nThe electrical characteristics of the a-IGTO TFTs were evaluated to investigate the effects of SF6 plasma treatment on the electrical performance of the devices. All the a-IGTO TFTs, with or without the SF6 plasma treatment and addition of O2 gas, exhibited well-behaved nchannel operation. However, clear differences in the electrical characteristics, such as the threshold voltage (Vth), field-effect mobility (μ), and sub-threshold swing (SS), were observed between the a-IGTO TFTs fabricated without SF6 plasma treatment and all the SF6 plasma-treated a-IGTO TFTs. From the transfer characteristics, we observed that the aIGTO TFTs plasma-treated with SF6 exhibited remarkably ameliorated electrical characteristics compared with those fabricated without the SF6 plasma treatment (Fig. 1b). In particular, the plasma-treated a-IGTO \nTFTs showed nearly a two-fold increase in the *mobility (SF6 plasmatreated a-IGTO TFT without* O2 gas, 19.4 cm2/V⋅s) and Vth values relatively closer to zero. The overall improvement in the electrical performance due to SF6 plasma treatment can be associated with the diffused F \natoms that simultaneously passivate the oxygen vacancies and act as Frelated donor defects that increase the carrier concentration in the aIGTO channel layer . In addition, the electrical characteristics of the SF6 plasma-treated a-IGTO TFTs differed depending on the presence or absence of O2 gas during the SF6 plasma treatment. Compared with a-IGTO TFTs fabricated without O2 gas during the SF6 plasma treatment, a-IGTO TFTs fabricated with O2 gas during the SF6 plasma treatment exhibited a lower on-current. This tendency can be attributed to the increased etching effect from the addition of O2 gas during the SF6 plasma treatment . \nRegardless of the presence of O2 gas during the SF6 plasma treatment, the SF6 plasma-treated a-IGTO TFTs exhibited superior uniformity of electrical characteristics than their untreated counterparts (Fig. 1c). \nThe Vth deviation, determined by the standard deviation (σ) calculated from a total of 12 devices per fabrication condition, was 1.72 for the bare a-IGTO TFT and decreased to 0.89 (without O2 gas during the plasma treatment) and 0.97 (with O2 gas during plasma treatment) for the SF6 plasma-treated a-IGTO TFT. Ideally, Vth should be close to zero as the onset voltage of the operation regime, and because the Vth deviation among devices must be minimized for long-term circuit operation, the smaller the σ, the more ideal it is [33–35]. The average field-effect mobilities of SF6 plasma-treated a-IGTO TFTs were 19.4 (without O2 gas during plasma treatment) and 12.2 cm2/V⋅s (with O2 gas during plasma treatment), which were higher than that of the bare a-IGTO TFTs \n(11.6 cm2/V⋅s). The standard deviations in the extracted mobilities of SF6 plasma-treated a-IGTO TFTs were 0.42 (without O2 gas during plasma treatment) and 0.43 (with O2 gas during plasma treatment), \nwhich were lower than that of the bare a-IGTO TFTs (1.43). Furthermore, the SS value decreased from 0.25 V/dec for the bare a-IGTO TFT \nto 0.08 V/dec (without O2 gas during plasma treatment) and 0.09 V/dec (with O2 gas during plasma treatment) for the SF6 plasma-treated a-IGTO TFTs. These results show that SF6 plasma treatment yields substantial improvements not only in the electrical characteristics of a-IGTO \nTFTs but also in their uniformity. Ensuring a high degree of uniformity in the electrical characteristics is critical to any large-scale application employing TFT arrays. Therefore, a well-controlled SF6 plasma treatment represents a suitable and facile method to achieve this objective. \nRegarding the electrical characteristics of the SF6 plasma-treated a-IGTO TFTs, it is essential to emphasize that the presence of O2 gas can trigger an etching effect during the treatment process. This phenomenon may explain the relatively suboptimal performance observed in the SF6 plasma-treated a-IGTO TFTs with O2 gas compared to those treated without O2 gas. \nTo elucidate the origin of the large mobility enhancements from SF6 plasma treatment, the contact resistance (RC) and bulk channel resistance (Rchannel) of a-IGTO TFTs were explored with the transfer line method (TLM) (Fig. 2a) . For AOS-based TFTs, the RC associated with the carrier injection barrier limits the on-current and hence leads to a compromised performance for various applications . RC is influenced by the gap-state induced Fermi energy level pinning and Schottky barrier height in metal/semiconductor junctions. Fundamentally, in thermionic emission mechanism of charge injection, the Schottky barrier height acts as a charge injection barrier for charged carriers within the semiconductor, resisting the movement of electrons. Consequently, a decrease in the Schottky barrier height leads to a reduction in RC, \nfacilitating charge injection and ultimately enhancing the carrier mobility [38–40]. The total resistance (Rtotal) was plotted as a function of channel length (100–500 μm) at VG of 30 V and VD of 2 V. RC was determined by linear fitting of plotted Rtotal, and Rchannel (channel length/width = 100 μm/500 μm) was determined using the following equation: \nRtotal = Rchannel + RC, (1) \nThe SF6 plasma-treated a-IGTO TFTs exhibited a lower RC compared to the bare a-IGTO TFTs, contributing to improved *mobility*. The Rchannel also decreased in the SF6 plasma-treated a-IGTO TFT, which can be attributed to the increase in the carrier concentration due to F diffusion. \nThe Rchannel of SF6 plasma-treated a-IGTO TFTs with O2 gas appears to decrease relatively slightly due to the etching effect of O2 gas and excess O2 gas. \nWe also calculated the maximum interfacial trap density (Ntr) from the SS of the a-IGTO TFTs using the following equation: \nNtr = Ciq [ Q - Ss Kbt Ln(10) − 1 ] (2)\nwhere q is the elementary charge, SS is the subthreshold swing, kB is Boltzmann's constant, and Ci is the capacitance of the gate dielectric layer (Fig. 2b). The quality of the interface between the channel and gate dielectric layers can be directly evaluated because SS reflects the interface trap capacitance caused by trapped carriers (electrons) at the interface . The calculated Ntr value of the a-IGTO TFTs decreased from 7.12 × 1011 (bare a-IGTO TFT) to 1.02 × 1011 (SF6 plasma-treated a-IGTO TFT without O2 gas) and 1.26 × 1011 cm− 2 eV− 1 (SF6 plasma-treated a-IGTO TFT with O2 gas). The number of interfacial traps in the SF6 plasma-treated a-IGTO TFTs, with and without O2 gas, was approximately seven-fold in magnitude lower than that in the bare a-IGTO TFTs. The decrease in the number of interfacial traps can be attributed to the presence of fewer trapping sites at the interface due to the diffused S and F in the a-IGTO thin film. The diffused S and F reduce the number of oxygen vacancies in the a-IGTO thin film, as discussed above. Regarding the role of O2 gas, the addition of O2 gas during plasma treatment can significantly enhance the etching effect, which can generate additional oxygen vacancies by breaking the bonds between the metal ions and oxygen atoms in the a-IGTO thin films. However, oxygen atoms are also exceptional passivating agents that can fill and effectively passivate defect sites. Thus, despite the additional oxygen vacancies generated from the etching effect, the excess oxygen atoms from the addition of O2 gas, along with S and F atoms, can passivate these defect sites in the a-IGTO thin films, resulting in a significantly reduced Ntr compared to that of the bare a-IGTO TFT. These results show that the SF6 plasma treatment has significantly reduced the interfacial traps at the gate dielectric layer/channel layer interface in the a-IGTO TFTs, ameliorating their electrical performance. \nTo clarify the effect of the SF6 plasma treatment on the a-IGTO TFTs, a mechanism for ascertaining the role of diffused S and F in a-IGTO thin films is presented (Fig. 3). During SF6 plasma treatment, the diffusion of S and F into the a-IGTO thin films occurs. The diffused S and F have strong bonding energies with the oxygen atoms and metal ions in the aIGTO thin film. Therefore, they can break weak, unstable bonds between the metal ions and the oxygen atoms and form new, stable bonds, consequently reducing the oxygen vacancy sites (In–F:506 kJ/mol, \nIn–O:360 kJ/mol, Ga–F:577 kJ/mol, Ga–O:285 kJ/mol, S–O:521.7 kJ/ mol, and Sn–O:548 kJ/moI) [ 42 , 43 ]. While S and F act as passivating agents for oxygen vacancies, F acts solely as a donor-like defect that increases the carrier concentration in the a- IGTO thin films. As the ionic radius of F (0.64 Å) is smaller than that of S (1.04 Å), F bonds more readily with oxygen and metal ions, which suppresses the diffusion of S\ninto defect sites such as oxygen vacancies [ 28 ]. Despite the decrease in the oxygen vacancies due to the diffusion of S and F, the carrier concentration in the a-IGTO thin film has increased because of F-related donor defects associated with F-induced oxygen vacancy defects. In a-IGTO thin films treated simultaneously with SF 6 plasma treatment and O 2 gas, the etching effect of O 2 gas and excess O 2 gas breaks the bonds between the metal ions and oxygen atoms, increasing the number of oxygen vacancies. However, they are simultaneously passivated by the diffused oxygen, S, and F atoms, resulting in fewer oxygen vacancies compared to the bare a-IGTO thin films, as previously mentioned. Excess O 2 gas has a strong bonding energy with S, forms a relatively large number of bonds with S, and increases the resistance of the plasma-treated a-IGTO thin film. In addition, the diffused O 2 gas increased the number of impurity bonds between the metal ions and hydroxyl groups.\nXPS and ToF-SIMS analyses were performed to verify the aforementioned SF 6 plasma treatment mechanism and examine the chemical composition of the a-IGTO thin films affected by the SF 6 plasma treatment. The O 1s peaks of the SF 6 plasma-treated or -untreated a-IGTO thin film surface were characterized via XPS narrow scan spectra, and each spectrum was deconvoluted into three peaks: metal- oxide (M - O)\npeak at 529.8 ± 0.1 eV, metal-oxygen vacancy (M-Oy) peak at 530.7 ±\n0.1 eV, and metal-hydrogen (M - OH) peak at 531.9 ± 0.1 eV ( Fig. 4a )\n[ 44 , 45 ]. The relative amounts of these peaks are quantified in Fig. S1 . The M - O peak is attributed to oxygen bonding with metal ions in the a-IGTO thin films and thus represents the number of oxygen atoms in a fully oxidized stoichiometric environment and is related to the conducting pathway. The M-O, and M - OH bonds interfere with the charge transport of metallic and oxygen orbital regions and reduce the TFT\nstability while defecting oxygen vacancies at the gate dielectric\nlayer/channel interface and acting as charge trapping sites. In addition, they are related to chemisorbed or dissociated oxygen, absorbed moisture, and hydroxyl groups on the thin film surface. Compared with the bare a-IGTO TFT, the a-IGTO TFT treated with SF 6 and O 2 gas showed an increase in the area ratio of the M - O peak and a decrease in the area ratio of the M-O, and M - OH peaks ( Fig. 4 b). This is because the SF 6 plasma treatment caused S and F to diffuse into the a-IGTO thin film, subsequently form bonds with the metal ions, and thereby reduce the oxygen vacancies. While both S and F effectively passivate the oxygen vacancies, the diffused F, which has a smaller ionic radius and acts as a donor-like defect, bonds more readily with metal ions in the a-IGTO thin-film, thus leading to an increase in the carrier concentration and consequent improvements in both performance and reliability of a-IGTO\nThe SF 6 plasma-treated a-IGTO TFTs with O 2 gas, during the plasma treatment, showed different trends as observed in the XPS analysis\n( Fig. 4 c ). For the SF 6 plasma-treated a-IGTO thin film with O 2 gas, the area ratios of the M - O and M - OH peaks decreased and increased, respectively, compared to the bare a-IGTO thin film and SF 6 plasmatreated a-IGTO thin film without O 2 gas. The O 2 gas flowing during the SF 6 plasma treatment causes an etching effect, which breaks the bonds between the metal ions and oxygen atoms inside the a-IGTO thin film, decreasing and increasing the area ratios of the M - O and M - OH\npeaks, respectively, owing to the dissociated oxygen [ 32 , 46 ]. The area ratio of the M-O, peak of the SF 6 plasma-treated a-IGTO thin film with O 2 gas was higher than that of the SF 6 plasma-treated a-IGTO thin film without O 2 gas and lower than that of the bare a-IGTO thin film. By flowing O 2 gas on the a-IGTO thin film during the SF 6 plasma treatment, oxygen vacancies in the a-IGTO thin film were reduced, while chemisorption due to excess oxygen occurred on the surface, resulting in a decrease in the area ratio of the M-Ov peak compared to the bare a-IGTO\nthin film. However, plasma treatment causes an etching effect owing to the O 2 gas, and the O 2 gas breaks down the bonds between the metal ions and oxygen atoms inside the a-IGTO thin film. Oxygen vacancies were generated by the dissociated oxygen; therefore, the area ratio of the M-O v peak increased compared with that of the SF 6 plasma-treated a-IGTO thin film without O 2 gas. In addition, ToF-SIMS analysis was conducted to identify the effect of diffused S and F atoms in the channel layer of the a-IGTO TFTs ( Fig. 4 d–f ). We confirmed that S and F diffused inside the a-IGTO thin films through the SF 6 plasma treatment. Because the ionic radius of F is smaller than that of S, a difference in the degree of diffusion exists, with F diffusing deeper into the a-IGTO thin films. The difference in the amount of S diffused on the back-channel side during the SF 6 plasma treatment with and without O 2 gas is attributed to the etching effect of O 2 gas, and the excess O 2 gas causes more S to bond with oxygen (S–O:522 kJ/mol and O–F:222 kJ/mol) [ 42 , 43 ]. The increased amount of S in the back channel also decreased the mobility as the resistance of the a-IGTO thin film increased. In addition, a difference was observed in the amount of hydrogen, which was attributed to the reduction of hydrogen while bonding with oxygen owing to the etching effect of O 2 gas and excess O 2 gas during the SF 6 plasma treatment with O 2 gas. Therefore, the XPS analysis of the a-IGTO thin film plasma-treated with SF 6 and O 2 gas shows an increase in the M - OH\nThe surface morphology, vertical structure, and wetting properties of the a-IGTO thin films treated by SF 6 plasma treatment with and without O 2 gas were analyzed using AFM, cross-sectional TEM, and water contact angle measurements, respectively. The SF 6 plasma-treated a-IGTO\nthin films with and without O 2 gas exhibited changes in surface morphology. According to literature, the high surface roughness of the semiconductor thin film degrades the electrical performance for the following reasons: (1) electron carrier scattering at the interface between the channel layer and gate dielectric layer; (2) increased interface trapping sites at the interface between the channel layer and gate dielectric layer; and (3) particularly for the AOS back channel, a larger effective oxygen adsorption area, which possibly decreases the electron carrier concentration in the AOS back channel due to a depletion effect [ 47 ]. The root-mean-square roughness ( R q ) of the SF 6 plasma-treated a-IGTO thin films with and without O 2 gas decreased from 0.454 nm\n(bare a-IGTO thin film) to 0.262 and 0.385 nm, respectively ( Fig. 5a –c ).\nThe SF6 plasma treatment reduced the surface roughness of the a-IGTO \nthin film and consequently reduced the number of trapping sites generated at the channel/gate dielectric interface and the oxygen adsorption generated in the back channel of the a-IGTO thin film. \nHowever, the surface roughness of the SF6 plasma-treated a-IGTO thin film treated with O2 gas was lower compared to that of the SF6 plasma-treated a-IGTO thin film without O2 gas, owing to the etching effect of the added O2 gas. Cross-sectional images of all a-IGTO thin films were obtained using TEM (Fig. S2). Similar to the AFM images, the cross-sectional TEM images show that the vertical structure changed slightly macroscopically in the SF6 plasma-treated a-IGTO thin films. \nHowever, there was no significant difference in the vertical structure during plasma treatment in the a-IGTO thin film subjected to SF6 plasma treatment with and without O2 gas. As mentioned above, it is important to minimize defects due to adsorbed moisture and O2 gas generated in the back channel of the AOS-based TFT. Therefore, we performed contact angle measurements to confirm the degree of hydrophobicity (inset in Fig. 5a–c). In general, water contact angles greater than 90◦ indicate hydrophobicity, and all the a-IGTO thin films had contact angles less than 90◦ . Nevertheless, the contact angles of the SF6 plasma-treated a-IGTO thin films increased more than those of the bare a-IGTO thin films and were close to 90◦. The hydrophobicity increased under the influence of F, and the SF6 plasma treatment reduced the effect of reducing defects caused by moisture and oxygen adsorbed in the back channel of the a-IGTO thin films. \nTo confirm the feasibility of the SF6 plasma-treated a-IGTO thin film for transparent TFTs, the transparent plasma-treated a-IGTO thin film was fabricated on a 0.5-mm-thick glass substrate (AMG Korea). Through the transmission spectrum of a-IGTO thin films, the transmittance of SF6 plasma-treated a-IGTO thin films was much higher than that of bare aIGTO thin film (Fig. 5d). In particular, the a-IGTO thin film treated with SF6 plasma treatment without O2 gas exhibited outstanding transparency with a transmission of 97.6% at the wavelength of 550 nm. The optical transmittance is dependent on the scattering of free electrons, because the light absorption is induced by the scattering of free electrons within the conduction band . Therefore, when diffused F substitutes oxygen in the a-IGTO thin film by SF6 plasma treatment, the electron perturbation is mainly confined to the filled valence band, reducing the scattering of conduction electrons, resulting in high thin film transparency as well as low absorption loss. However, the a-IGTO thin film treated with SF6 plasma treatment with O2 gas showed relatively little improvement in transparency due to the etching effect of O2 gas and excess O2 gas. In addition, the building and logo of the Sungkyunkwan University was employed for the image observation to validate the transparency of the thin film (Fig. 5e). Due to the excellent transparency of the SF6 plasma-treated a-IGTO thin film without O2 gas, it was sufficient to see the building and logo through this thin film fabricated on the glass substrate. Visually, there was no significant difference in transparency between the SF6 plasma-treated a-IGTO thin film without O2 gas compared to the bare glass substrate. \nTo further explore the effect of SF6 plasma treatment on the a-IGTO \nTFT stability, we evaluated the a-IGTO TFTS by comparing the Vth shifts \n(ΔVth) that occur under various gate bias stress tests. The effects of the bias stress were evaluated via PBS, NBS, and NBIS tests. PBS (applying gate bias for 2 MV/cm), NBS (applying gate bias for − 2 MV/cm), and NBIS (applying gate bias for − 2 MV/cm and light exposure at 3000 lux) \nwere performed from 0 to 3000 s for the bare a-IGTO TFT and SF6 plasma-treated a-IGTO TFTs (Fig. 6a–c). The shifts in the transfer characteristics for each of the comprehensive PBS, NBS, and NBIS tests conducted on the a-IGTO TFTs are depicted in Figs. S3–5. Generally, the bias instabilities under PBS and NBS for a-IGTO TFTs are generated by either charge (electron or hole) trapping at the channel/gate dielectric layer interface or charge coupling modulation caused by the potential energy of the adsorbed molecules [50–52]. However, compared to the bare a-IGTO TFT, the SF6 plasma-treated a-IGTO TFTs exhibited significantly improved stability under the PBS and NBS tests. The ΔVth value \ndecreased from 13.3 V (bare a-IGTO TFT) to 1.85 V (SF6 plasma-treated a-IGTO TFT without O2 gas) and 5.12 V (SF6 plasma-treated a-IGTO TFT \nwith O2 gas) under PBS test (Fig. 6a). The ΔVth value decreased from \n− 4.1 V (bare a-IGTO TFT) to − 0.8 V (SF6 plasma-treated a-IGTO TFT \nwithout O2 gas) and − 1.38 V (SF6 plasma-treated a-IGTO TFT with O2 gas) under NBS test (Fig. 6b). Under light illumination (NBIS test), Vth of the plasma-treated and untreated a-IGTO TFTs shifted similarly \n(Fig. 6c). For the NBIS test, this ΔVth under light illumination is attributed to the physical separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs caused by the negative bias, which confines the electrons in the back channel even after illumination has ceased . As all the a-IGTO channel layers were optically transparent and were thus vulnerable to light illumination, the Vth of all the a-IGTO TFTs shifted significantly . Nevertheless, all the SF6 plasma-treated a-IGTO TFTs showed minimal shift in the Vth up to 2000 s of induced bias. This is because the diffusion of S and F inhibited the ionization of the uncoordinated oxygen species, which delivers extra electrons to the a-IGTO thin film. With these results, our study can be extended to form the basis for research on the development of high-performance and reliable AOS-based TFTs through the utilization of plasma treatment with gases containing S and F. \n3. **Conclusions**\nWe fabricated highly transparent a-IGTO TFTs with significantly ameliorated electrical characteristics and reliability through a facile and simple SF6 plasma treatment process and identified the underlying mechanism behind these improvements. While both S and F can effectively reduce the number of oxygen vacancies in the a-IGTO thin film, S \nincreases the resistivity, whereas F decreases the resistivity through its role as a donor-like defect. SF6 plasma treatment was performed after activation annealing to maximize the diffusion of F, which plays a positive role in a-IGTO thin films. We also confirmed the effect of adding O2 gas during SF6 plasma treatment through a comparative analysis of SF6 plasma treatment performed with and without O2 gas. The electrical characteristics and uniformity of the a-IGTO TFTs were significantly enhanced by the treatment process. In particular, the field-effect mobility demonstrated a nearly 2-fold increase of 19.4 cm2/V⋅s. In addition, the ΔVth of a-IGTO TFTs treated with SF6 plasma treatment showed that the stability was highly improved under various bias stress tests. S and F diffused into a-IGTO thin films through SF6 plasma treatment, reducing the oxygen vacancies by breaking weak bonds between metal ions and oxygen atoms and simultaneously generating S- and Fpassivated oxygen vacancies. Despite the decrease in the oxygen vacancies, the diffused F acted as a donor-like defect, resulting in an increase in the carrier concentration and thus contributing to the overall performance and reliability enhancement of the a-IGTO TFTs. However, when the SF6 plasma treatment was performed with O2 gas, the etching effect of O2 gas and excess O2 gas increased the impurity bonds in the aIGTO thin film, leading to a minimal decrease in the performance and reliability of the a-IGTO TFT. We firmly believe that the SF6 plasma treatment process presented in this study shows high potential for enabling facile and efficient fabrication of high-performance and reliable AOS-based TFTs across a wide range of next-generation transparent electronic applications. \n4. **Experimental Section**\nFabrication of a-IGTO thin films: The 4-inch InGaSnO (a-IGTO, 99.99% \npurity) target was sputtered on pre-cleaned SiO2/p++ Si substrates using a DC magnetron sputtering system. The chemical composition of the target, In2O3:Ga2O3:SnO2 = 7:1:2 with an atomic ratio. A 15-nmthick a-IGTO thin film was deposited using Invar metal shadow masks \n(W/L, 150/150 μm). During the sputtering process, Ar and O2 gases were injected into the sputtering chamber at constant gas flow rates of 25 and 25 sccm, respectively, and the chamber pressure was maintained at 3 mTorr. The DC power condition was set to 100 W. Following the sputtering of a-IGTO thin films, they were activation-annealed at 200 ◦C in a box furnace for 1 h to exhibit semiconducting characteristics. \nSF6 plasma treatment: The SF6 plasma treatment technique was applied to activation-annealed a-IGTO thin films using plasma equipment. The following set of parameters at different conditions (during SF6 plasma treatment with and without O2 gas) was used for the SF6 plasma treatment: plasma power (30 W), plasma pressure (30 mTorr), SF6 gas flow rate (20 sccm), O2 gas flow rate (2 sccm), and RF frequency (13.56 MHz). A total of 12 samples were fabricated for each specific plasma treatment condition. \nCharacterization of a-IGTO thin films: To obtain the atomic composition and analyze the chemical binding properties of all the a-IGTO thin films, XPS (NEXSA, Thermo Scientific Inc.) was performed. The 12 morphologies of the thin films were determined by AFM (NX-10, Park Systems). SIMS measurements were acquired using a ToF-SIMS 5 from ION-TOF GmbH (Munster, Germany), equipped with a Bi+1 (25 keV, 1 pA, 100 × 100 μm2) liquid metal primary-ion gun with a 45◦ incident angle for analysis, and a dual-source column for Cs+ (1 keV, 60 nA, 300 \n× 300 μm2) depth profiling. The surface wettability of the thin films was measured using a contact angle meter (Smart Drop Standard, Femtobiomed, Korea) to quantify the contact angle between the probe liquid \n(distilled water) and the thin films. Cross-sectional images of the vertical structures were obtained using TEM (JEOL, JEM-2100FS; accelerating voltage of 200 kV). To prepare the TEM specimens, aluminum and platinum layers were sequentially deposited on the samples to protect \nthe thin films against high-energy gallium ions during focused-ion-beam milling (FEI, Nova Nanolab). The UV–vis spectra were recorded by Carry 5000, Agilent Technology. The field-effect mobility (μ) was extracted from the transconductance values at a drain-source voltage (VD) of 5.1 V \nbased on the following equation: μ = gm Ci W\n. The threshold voltage (Vth) \nwas extracted from VD = 5.1 V, 10 nA, and the subthreshold swing (SS) \nwas calculated by fitting the following equation to the subthreshold region of the measured transfer curve: SS = ∂VG\nFabrication of a-IGTO TFTs: The a-IGTO TFTs with top-contact bottom-gate (TCBG) configurations were fabricated. Briefly, 70-nm-thick Al as source/drain (S/D) electrodes were deposited on bare a-IGTO thin film and SF6 plasma-treated a-IGTO thin films with and without O2 gas using an e-beam evaporator.

        "text": "Tft Channel Materials For Display Applications: From Amorphous Silicon To Transition Metal Dichalcogenides\nGi Woong Shim, Woonggi Hong, Jun-Hwe Cha, Jung Hwan Park, Keon Jae Lee, and Sung-Yool Choi* As the need for super-high-resolution displays with various form factors has increased, it has become necessary to produce high-performance thin-film transistors (TFTs) that enable faster switching and higher current driving of each pixel in the display. Over the past few decades, hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) has been widely utilized as a TFT channel material. More recently, to meet the requirement of new types of displays such as organic light-emitting diode displays, and also to overcome the performance and reliability issues of a-Si:H, low-temperature polycrystalline silicon and amorphous oxide semiconductors have partly replaced a-Si:H channel materials. Basic material properties and device structures of TFTs in commercial displays are explored, and then the potential of atomically thin layered transition metal dichalcogenides as next-generation channel materials is discussed.\n1. Introduction 1.1. History Of Display Technology\nPlasma display panels (PDPs) were first invented in 1927 using glow discharge to create images. Current types of PDPs were first invented in 1964 and were commercially produced beginning in 1972. \nBy 2010, PDPs up to 150 inches in size could be mass produced. In a PDP, ultraviolet (UV) light produced from plasma excites phosphors and generates light. Consequently, PDPs do not need backlight units, enabling them to cover wider color gamuts compared to those covered by liquid crystal displays (LCDs) using filters. \nIn addition, because it is not necessary to rearrange liquid crystal (LC) molecules, PDPs exhibit a superior response rate compared to LCDs. Moreover, the structure of PDPs are simpler than LCDs that makes PDPs more advantageous in large-area scalability. However, because PDPs rely on glow discharge to operate, they consume large amounts of energy and produce a significant amount of heat. In addition, small PDP panels (<32 inches) have not yet been successfully produced. Therefore, LCDs and organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) are widely used because of their energy efficiency and both small- and large-area scalability.\nWith regard to LCDs, electronic watches with LCDs were first produced in 1972, and active matrix-LCDs (AM-LCDs) \ncontaining high-temperature polysilicon (HTPS) came onto the market in 1984. Furthermore, AM-LCDs based on a-Si:H appeared in 1986, and in 2010 and 2012, respectively, AM-LCDs based on low-temperature polycrystalline silicon (LTPS) and amorphous oxide semiconductor (AOS) were produced. The first commercial use of OLEDs occurred in 1997 when passive matrix-OLEDs (PM-OLEDs) were incorporated into automotive audio systems. AM-OLEDs were first used in camera displays in 2003, and currently, ≈88 inch displays with 8K resolution that utilize both LCDs and OLEDs are widely used.\n1.2. Driving Methods Of Display\nFor low resolution displays such as those found on electronic watches, each electrode can be connected to a single pixel with a directly induced voltage input. This method is known as direct driving (**Figure** 1a). However, as the number of pixels increases into the range of about 10 000 pixels, the overall \ndriving system becomes very complicated because there is now a need for 10 000 individual electrodes. Alternatively, the complexity of the driving system can be effectively decreased if the same 10 000 pixels are operated in a 100 × 100 matrix using an integrated circuit (IC) and timing controllers. Therefore, this matrix driving scheme has been extensively utilized in high resolution displays. There are two matrix driving methods, known as PM and AM. PM addressing is an addressing scheme in which scan lines in rows and data lines in columns are crossed and the overlapped area can be selected (Figure 1b). During a single time frame, the scan lines scan through the overall lines in serial order and then switch pixels on by applying voltage to the data lines. During this process, a single pixel stays on only during 1/n frame time (where n is the number of scan lines). Because luminance can be represented as an average of the brightness produced during the frame time, a high degree of brightness is momentarily necessary in each line, which creates disadvantages in terms of lifetime and power consumption \n(Figure 1d). Therefore, AM addressing, in which a constant lower level luminescence is maintained over one frame time, is preferred in high resolution displays. This is enabled by two processes. First, charges are stored in capacitors (CST) when the scan line turns on the switching TFTs by applying gate voltage. Then, the stored charges are used to supply voltage to the LC or the driving TFTs for the rest of the frame time (Figure 1c). Because AM addressing generates a lower luminance than PM addressing, it has a longer lifetime and consumes less power. \nIn addition, it is possible to prevent crosstalk due to interference between the scan and data lines, which allows for a high contrast ratio and clear image outputs. However, for low resolution displays, the PM method without capacitors and TFTs has the advantage of being less expensive.\nLCD uses a voltage driven driving scheme that operates by means of passing or blocking a backlight by applying voltage to easily polarizable LC molecules. In contrast, OLED normally adopts current driving methods, in which the luminance can be modulated depending on the current flow. For AM-LCD, a 1T-1C (1 transistor and 1 capacitor) structure is commonly used. However, AM-OLED works in 2T-1C structure in which the 2T elements consist of a driving transistor for tuning the current level and a switching transistor for turning it on or off \n(Figure 1c). In commercial displays, compensation circuits such as 6T-1C and 7T-1C are used to mitigate changes in materials properties and device characteristics over time, and to minimize issues due to non-uniformity of channel materials.\nTo produce high resolution displays, the performance of TFTs needs to be improved. There are several advantages for using high mobility (μ) channel materials. First, in AM displays, high μ TFTs can guarantee that CST will be charged in a short amount of time. This is more preferred to drive displays with large panels, high resolutions, and high frame rates where the charging time allowed is very short. Second, high μ TFTs are preferred when a high driving current level is needed. The driving current produced in TFTs depends on the geometry of channel. It is directly proportional to the channel width (W) and inversely proportional to the channel length (L). This implies that reducing L can be used to obtain a high current density. However, in current technology, L in display TFTs have already been reduced to 2–3 µm, which is Gi Woong Shim received \nhis B.S. degree in chemistry (2014) and M.S. degree in electrical engineering \n(2016) from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). He is now pursuing a Ph.D. degree at KAIST under the supervision of Prof. Sung-Yool Choi. \nHis research is focused on the multiphysics modeling of the growth system for high quality two-dimensional materials and its device applications.\nSung-Yool Choi received B.S., \n![1_image_1.png](1_image_1.png) M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from the Department of Chemistry, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), in 1991, 1994, and 1998, respectively. He worked as a senior/principal researcher at Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI) from 1998 to 2011, then he joined the faculty of the School of Electrical Engineering, KAIST. He now serves as a director of the Graphene/2D Materials Research Center (GRC) and the Center for Advanced Materials Discovery towards 3D Display \n(CAMD3). His research focuses on the synthesis and processing of two-dimensional materials and their applications to the field of energy, electronics, and photonics.\nclose to the minimum size possible to produce using photolithography. Therefore, improving the intrinsic μ will boost the reduction in W further without causing degradation of the output current. This reduction in TFT size, in turn, contributes to decreased parasitic capacitance (undesired capacitance originated from the coupling between two components at a close distance; components include electrodes and channels which can flow charges) and leads to the design of smallersized CST. Moreover, a reduction in the aperture ratio improves luminance and decreases power consumption. Third, ultra-high-performance TFTs are required for applications demanding ultra-high resolutions such as mobile, augmented reality (AR), and virtual reality (VR) displays with various functionality and form factors. Finally, the high μ of TFTs enables peripheral circuits to be fabricated out of channel materials instead of using bulky IC chips. This makes the design of thin bezels possible, which is preferable for esthetic reasons.\nFigure 1e shows a typical transfer curve of TFTs. In the transfer curve, on current (Ion) and off current (Ioff) are defined as the maximum and minimum currents that can be obtained by applying a gate bias. When operating the displays, Ioff (or leakage current) is responsible for retaining charges in the \nCST. If Ioff is large, the stored charges can be easily released. \nTherefore, the refresh rate should be high to compensate for these discharges, and this causes the power consumption to increase. Ion is especially important for driving OLED displays, which require a high driving current (10–100 mA cm−2). For a display that has a pixel size of 100 × 100 µm2, μ required for driving an OLED with 5 µA per pixel is estimated to be 12.5 cm2 V−1 s−1.\n Subthreshold swing (SS) is defined as the gate voltage necessary to increase the drain current by a factor of 10 in the subthreshold region. In TFT, SS is related to the interfacial trap density (the smaller the interfacial trap density, the smaller the SS value). Having a smaller SS is advantageous for increasing the switching speed and reducing power consumption. Threshold voltage (Vth) is the minimum gate voltage necessary to allow current to flow in the TFT. Several extraction methods are available, but the extrapolation in the linear regime method is widely used (Figure 1e), where the Vth is represented as the sum of V at the intercept and Vds/2. Vth is related to the power consumption, and its polarity is important in the design of circuit. Figure 1f shows the output curve, which is divided into a linear region (blue) and a saturation region (red). Pinchoff voltage, which is the point at which an increase in drain bias does not contribute to additional current flow, is used to distinguish between the two regions. Switching TFTs in LCDs and OLEDs operate in the saturation region because the only function required is the ability to turn on and off. For driving TFTs in OLEDs, precise tuning of the current is needed, which means that they should operate in the linear region.\n1.3. Requirements Of Tft Processes And Substrates\nTFT processes are normally carried out in a temperature range that extends up to 600 °C. Accordingly, substrates should be able to withstand these temperatures while still being affordable. Glass substrates are widely used, because they have advantages in terms of price, rigidity, and low-temperature processsability. In addition, in visible light (380–740 nm), glass substrates have a high transmittance of >90%, which is essential for backlight-based LCDs. As for OLEDs, such a high transmittance can achieve a high efficiency with a bottom emission structure. However, for a top emission structure, the substrate does not need to be transparent. Therefore, polymer substrates such as polyimide (PI) are also widely used for top emission OLED displays. Meanwhile, both glass and heat resistant polymer substrates need to have relatively flat and smooth surfaces with good thermal resistance and low thermal expansion coefficients. Moreover, a high stability for chemical exposure and low permeability to oxygen and water is required.\nThe low temperature processability requirement is more strict for channel materials within displays. Even though single crystal materials have higher μ, the area that can be achieved by a single crystal growth of silicon is limited to ≈12 inches \n(300 mm). Note that the temperature necessary for the silicon single crystal growth is also high due to its high melting point (1414 °C). Therefore, channel materials in the display are deposited as thin amorphous or poly-crystalline films by a vapor deposition process instead of as single crystals.\nThe concept of devices based on thin films, or TFT, was first patented in the 1930s, and TFTs that used vacuum-deposited polycrystalline CdS were first reported in 1962. Later, CdSe, Te, PbS, InSb, and PbTe, with μ ranging from several to several dozens of cm2 V−1 s−1 were reported. In 1971, the concept of operating LCs with an AM consisting of 1T-1C and one LC element was first proposed, and based on this concept, the first CdSe-based AM-LCD was reported in 1973. In 1979, TFTs using a-Si:H that was deposited by a glow discharge method were reported. Meanwhile, compound semiconductors such as CdSe were unable to be commercialized due to difficulties in controlling their properties and low device reliability in large areas.  In contrast, existing well- established Si- based processes have allowed for rapid commercialization of a-Si:H and LTPS technologies.\n2. Hydrogenated Amorphous Si Tfts 2.1. Density Of States Of A-Si:H\nTo evaluate the potential of emerging channel materials such as transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), it is important to understand the traditional but commercialized channel materials such as a-Si:H and LTPS. It is because they are governed by similar physical principles (i.e., carrier transport models, density of states or DOSs, bias instability models). a-Si:H is deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD)\nusing SiH 4 as a precursor. Here, plasma is used to lower decomposition temperature of SiH 4 from ≈ 800 to ≈ 300 °C, and that the substrate can withstand.  However, due to the low deposition temperature, amorphous films with a short-range order are deposited (Figure 2a), showing significantly inferior characteristics over single crystal Si. Despite that, a-Si:H has an exceptionally good uniformity that it is widely used in both small and large-sized displays.\nThe electrical properties of a-Si:H are highly related with DOS. Figure 2b,c shows how DOS of crystalline Si (c-Si) and a-Si\n(or a-Si:H) is different. First, due to variations in bond length\n(Si–Si) and bond angle, the band gap is larger for a-Si. Also, tail states and deep states are present between the conduction band (CB) and the valence band (VB) with a non-negligible density.\nHere, deep states are located far from both CB and VB edges and act as a deep trap site that capture charge carriers for a long time and severely degrade the transport properties of a-Si \nSince deep states originate from non-bonding states, hydrogenation by H 2 flow during PECVD is carried out to drastically reduce DOS of deep states from ~5 x 1019 to 1015-1016 cm-3\n(red- dotted line in Figure 2c).  Carrier transport in a- Si:H at\nthe room temperature primarily occurs through the CB (electrons) or VB (holes) that are hampered by trapping at the tail states (Figure 2d). Experimentally, drift μ is measured as 0.5–1 cm2 V−1 s−1 for electrons and ≈0.01 cm2 V−1 s−1 for holes. The large difference in μ enables only n-channel metal oxide semiconductor (NMOS) transistors to be employed for a-Si:H TFTs.\n2.2. Basic Device Structures 2.2.1. Bottom-Gate, Staggered, Back Channel Etched Structure\nTFT structures can be classified by the location of source, gate, and drain electrode. If the gate electrode is located under the semiconductor (or active layer), it is bottom-gated. For coplanar structure, source, drain, and gate electrodes are located on the same side of the active layer. On the other hand, staggered structure represents the gate electrode and source/drain electrode placed on the opposite sides of the active layer. Figure 2e shows a typical structure (bottom-gate, staggered, back channel etched or BCE) used in commercial a-Si:H TFTs. For driving a-Si:H TFTs, this structure has powerful advantages in sequential deposition of gate insulator (GI, a-SiNx:H), channel (a-Si:H), and ohmic contact and hole blocking layer (n+ a-Si:H) without breaking the vacuum during PECVD. This prevent the surface from being exposed to the ambient air during sequential deposition that minimize detrimental defect formation. This is especially important for a-Si:H, which is defect-rich and shows low performance. \nFor staggered structure with the top-gate, sequential deposition is also possible. However, ohmic contact layer should be deposited first, which is not preferred since dopants can be incorporated to the active layer during the following deposition of a-Si:H.\nMeanwhile, for bottom-gate staggered structure, deposition of source and drain electrodes should be carried out after deposition of trilayers (a-SiNx:H, a-Si:H, and n+ a-Si:H). Followed by the metal patterning, ohmic contact layer above the channel should be removed. This can be done by dry etching method, however, etching has no selectivity between ohmic and active layer. If n+ layer is not completely removed, leakage current can be increased. Therefore, over-etching of the n+ a-Si:H \nlayer takes place, which results in BCE structure. At this time, the a-Si:H layer is normally etched more than 10 nm. Therefore, the active layer should be sufficiently thick. When using etch stop layer (ESL) such as a-SiNx:H instead of BCE structure, additional photomasks are needed. Considering that the manufacturing cost largely increases with the number of masks, BCE structure is widely used in industry even if degradations in the properties (e.g., reduction in µ, increase in SS, \netc.) of active layer can occur during dry etching process.\n2.2.2. Heavily Doped Layers For Reduction In Contact Resistance\nAt the interface between metals and semiconductors, pinning of the Fermi level (EF) of metals to the certain level within semiconductors is commonly observed. This results in the formation of Schottky barriers regardless of the work function (ϕ) of metals. To solve this issue in Si electronics, heavily doped layers were introduced between metals and semiconductors.\n![4_image_0.png](4_image_0.png) When n+ or p+ region is introduced, Schottky barrier width can be effectively reduced. As a result, even though Schottky barrier is present, charge carriers can tunnel through the barrier and be injected into the semiconductor. Then, the ohmic contact can be formed and the contact resistance (Rc) can be mitigated (Figure 2f). The decrease in Rc reduces current crowding effects, which increases Ion and improves μ. Meanwhile, to achieve heavy doping, ion implantation is used in Si electronics. \nHowever, this is inefficient in a-Si:H due to low doping efficiency (the ratio of activated dopants to injected dopants) and the high density of tail states. Also, the subsequent annealing for the activation of dopants may remove hydrogen in a-Si:H, making plenty of deep trap states. Therefore, the doping in a-Si:H is performed by supplying dopant precursors together during the PECVD process for a-Si:H deposition. The final TFT \ndevices show typically low Ioff (≈10−12 A), which is attributed to the relatively high band gap of a-Si:H that prevent minority carriers generated by thermal energy.\n2.3. Bias Stress Instability\nIf the devices are operated for a prolonged time, device performance may degrade, or so-called device instability occurs. \nAmong many parameters, instability of Vth is the most notable \n(Figure 2g). The two main mechanisms responsible for the instabilities in a-Si:H are charge trapping and creation of deep state (dangling bond). First, applied field is screened by trapped charges at the GI/channel interface or within GI, resulting in the larger field required to achieve the same level of field within an active layer. Creation of deep states is caused by applied bias, which changes EF of a-Si:H and results in occupation of tail states in a-Si:H that can break weak bond and create dangling bond. Here, the created defects are metastable since annealing can effectively restore the changes made by the created defects.\nTo explain the charge trapping, the model suggested by Powell is widely used. Several routes are possible for the trapping as in Figure 2h. Experimentally, ΔVth has very little dependency on temperature. Therefore, the rate limiting step for charge trapping is tunneling (or injection of carriers from a-Si:H) rather than hopping within a-Si:H. Tunneling can take place in various routes, such as direct tunneling from states in a-Si:H to traps in SiNx, or Fowler-Nordheim tunneling to CB in SiNx followed by deep trapping (1–4 in Figure 2h). \nWhen the equilibrum among dangling bonds and related species are considered, ΔVth by defect creation can be expressed as Equation (1), which shows power-law dependency with the time.\nV V Th Gs V T Th / 0 ∆ = ( ) − ( ) T Β(1)\nLibsch and Kanichi suggested stretched-exponential model to explain both charge trapping and defect creation when applying bias. This can be expressed as Equation (2).\n$$\\left|\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{th}}\\right|=\\left|\\Delta V_{0}\\right|\\left\\{1-\\exp\\left[-\\left({\\frac{t}{\\tau}}\\right)^{\\beta}\\right]\\right\\}$$\nwhere the ΔV0 is ΔVth at infinite time, τ is the characteristic trapping time of carrier, and β (0 < β ≤ 1) is the stretched-exponential exponent. Here, τ reflects how fast the trapping and detrapping processes occur and smaller value implies fast process. Physically, τ is related with the energy barrier for the carrier injection from a-Si:H to SiNx. And β means a degree of divergence from exponential function. When β is 1, charge trapping with the time shows narrow distribution while broader distribution is expected when β is <1. Thus, as β is close to 1, the distribution of trap state can be regarded as narrow.\nAt short time (t < τ), low bias, and low temperature, exp(x) \ncan be approximated as 1 + x (x << 1) by Taylor series. Therefore, Equation (2) converges to the Equation (1). This indicates that the carriers are trapped at the surface region of SiNx, but are not diffuse further. On the other hand, at long time (t > τ), \nhigh bias, and high temperature, trap states at the surface region of SiNx is filled and further emission of carriers to trap states in bulk SiNx occur. Meanwhile, Equation (2) cannot be approximated as Equation (1) since no further redistribution of trapped carriers with time is assumed for Equation (1).\nNot only bias stress at dark conditions but bias stress under illumination should be considered. In commercial displays, active layers are covered by blocking layers to hinder light from entering. However, some portion of scattered light can enter to the active layer. In a-Si:H, many tail states can be excited by light with ease and produce free carriers. This is favorable for a solar cell application, however, is detrimental to the TFT reliability. As a result of large absorption of light, a-Si:H typically shows high photo-conductivity. Figure 2i shows bias stress instability under different level of illuminations, showing a shift in Vth and an increase in Ioff for more than four orders of magnitude. Meanwhile, due to the metastability of excited carriers, the induced change of ΔVth by charge trapping can be recovered by annealing.\n3. Low-Temperature Polysilicon Tft 3.1. Excimer Laser Annealing\nTo operate an LCD, the low μ of a-Si:H ranging from 0.5 to 1 cm2 V−1 s−1 is sufficient. However, a-Si:H has a disadvantage in terms of its bias instability. Since an OLED is operated by means of current driving, subtle variations in Vth would change the current level and luminance significantly. Meanwhile, the role of LCD-TFT is to change direction of LCs, which requires relatively low current that the use of a-Si:H is sufficient. The light source of LCD is a backlight. On the other hand, OLED is based on light emitting organic molecules that collect holes and electrons and recombine them to emit light. The intensity of the emitted light should be comparable to that of backlight from LED. Thus, a high level of current is required to drive OLED-TFTs, which is hard to be achieved by using a-Si:H. Therefore, a new channel material with bias stability and high μ is required to drive OLED. Meanwhile, when a strong laser is irradiated on the a-Si surface, the surface temperature of <1300 K can be reached in a short time, which can melt the a-Si. At this time, a-Si is crystallized into poly-Si owing to its energy stability. The crystallized LTPS now can show a high µ, typically ≈100 cm2 V−1 s−1. It is also possible to crystallize by supplying large amount of thermal energy \n(≈1000 °C). Therefore, poly-Si can be produced through furnace annealing of a-Si:H, and the resulting poly-Si is called HTPS. However, there are critical limitations for using HTPS. Since glass and polymer substrates can withstand temperatures of up to ≈600 °C, high-temperature processable substrates such as quartz should be used. Because of using substrates with large thermal budget, processes such as gate oxidation and dopant activation can be carried out at high temperatures, which gives a high-quality poly-Si TFTs with their μ as high as 50 cm2 V−1 s−1. \nSince the cost of the process increases rapidly as the size of the substrate grows, HTPS is an excellent choice in terms of price performance when the display size is small. Therefore, an HTPS-based application is limited to projector displays of ≈2–3 inches in size.\nIn the case of LTPS, crystallization is achieved using a 305 nm XeCl excimer laser, which is called excimer laser annealing (ELA), as shown in **Figure** 3a. Here, the pulse width of the excimer laser is generally very small, such as several tens of nanoseconds. Therefore, the temperature is increased and quenched very rapidly by the transient heat diffusion, thereby avoiding thermal damage to the substrate located under the a-Si layer. In addition, to prevent the diffusion of mobile impurities contained in the substrate, SiOx, SiNx, or a multilayer film composed of these materials is deposited on the substrate. This layer is called buffer layer, and it also prevents diffusion of generated heat by ELA into the substrate. When laser is irradiated on the a-Si film, a gate electrode can melt if it is placed under a-Si. Therefore, top-gate structure is generally used for the LTPS.\nMeanwhile, a laser with a point source is transformed into a linear shape through the use of a beam shaper and homogenizer. At this time, the size of the commercialized linear beam is ≈1500 × 0.4 mm2 at most. The larger beam will be better in terms of uniformity. However, not only it is difficult to make the lens large, but a high maintenance cost is required to fill the source gas (e.g., Xe) and the large number of masks are required to realize top-gate, coplanar structures. Therefore, LTPS is not practical for the large-area display applications, and its majority use is in mobile display. In addition, since the laser intensity is extremely uneven at the end of the line beam, it is difficult to obtain uniform grain sizes through a single shot irradiation. Thus, multiple scanning of the laser beam of up to dozens of times are carried out. However, still there are limitations to increasing the grain size and improving the uniformity. In addition, because the crystals have grain boundaries, large-area uniformity is inferior to that of a-Si:H or AOSs.\nFigure 3b shows the sizes of the grains formed according to the energy density of the laser when irradiated with a singlepulse excimer laser. If the energy density is low, only the upper part of the a-Si layer is partially melted, and the latent heat emitted through the solidification of the melted a-Si repeats the melting of the a-Si underneath, causing an explosive crystallization up to a certain thickness. This is called a partial melting regime. At this time, nucleation occurs at the interface between a-Si and molten Si. Since the crystallinity of the seed layer (i.e., a-Si layer) is poor, LTPS with high density of nuclei (i.e., small grain size) is formed. By contrast, when the \nenergy density increases, a near complete melting regime is reached. At this time, a portion of the unmelted a-Si acts as a seed, resulting in nucleation, which greatly reduces the nucleation density and forms large grains. When the energy density becomes higher, or under complete melting regime, all the a-Si layer melts and homogeneous nucleation occurs. Therefore, the nucleation density increases again, which barely changes even when the energy density increases. Therefore, practically ELA is carried out in a near complete melting regime (B and (ii) in Figure 3b,c). For the grain size, larger grains usually give high μ since the transport of charge carriers are highly hindered at the grain boundaries (Figure 3d). However, typical channel μ shows a saturation behavior when the grain size becomes greater than \n≈1 µm (Figure 3e).\n3.2. Basic Device Structures 3.2.1. Top-Gate, Coplanar, Self-Aligned Structure\nTo reduce the parasitic capacitance in LTPS, ion implantation is conducted using a gate electrode as a mask to form an n+ or p+ ohmic contact layer, and the dopant is activated through annealing in furnace or rapid thermal annealing (RTA). This structure is called a self-aligned structure (Figure 3f). In this case, because the gate electrode does not overlap with the source and drain electrodes, there is an advantage of reducing both the parasitic capacitance and the number of masks. Increasing the parasitic capacitance can lead to an RC delay and kick-back, which can be a source of quality degradation in display such as flickering.\nIn terms of GIs, when the active layer is a-Si:H, TFTs with PECVD-SiNx as GI generally exhibits better performance than that TFTs using PECVD-SiOx as GI. For example, low bias stress instability and smaller SS is achieved when SiNx was used as GI. By contrast, the LTPS formed by the ELA process has an extremely poor roughness. Therefore, typically SiOx is used as GI, which has a high quality and can form a good interface with Si.\nMeanwhile, unlike a-Si:H, LTPS allows a complementary MOS (CMOS) technology to be implemented because the hole μ (μh) is comparable to the electron μ (μe), which can reduce the power consumption. However, there is a disadvantage in that the process cost increases owing to an increase in the number of masks. For an NMOS, it can perform better than PMOS \nbecause μe is higher than μh for an LTPS. However, PMOS can be implemented with ease since it has a lower leakage current and the TFT is connected to a stable ITO electrode in an OLED. By contrast, NMOS is more difficult to realize because the TFT \nshould be connected to the cathode electrode, which is relatively unstable in an OLED.\n3.2.2. Lightly Doped Drain Structure\nUnlike a-Si:H, LTPS has a high μe. This enables acceleration of electrons at a high speed and leads to impact ionization. As a result, an additional electron-hole pairs are generated, and the high energy of the hot carriers can damage the active layer and GI, creating interface states. As a result, when a reverse bias is applied, the trapped minority carriers can flow that leads to a high leakage current. If the leakage current is high, the charge \nstored in the capacitor is consumed constantly even if the pixel is not in an on-state. Therefore, power consumption should be increased to compensate for this. In addition, if the number of carriers increases drastically through an impact ionization, a kink occurs, in which the Ids does not remain constant and increases rapidly as the Vds increases in the saturated region. \nThis leads to an instability of Vth. Eventually, the problems can be improved by reducing the electric field near the drain electrode. The simplest approach is to increase the distance between the drain electrode and the channel, which can reduce Ioff but increase the parasitic resistance (a parasitic capacitance originates from a capacitor, which always has a resistance), \nwhich can significantly reduce Ion. As a result, Ion/Ioff remains similar. To compensate for this, weakly doping (n−) the offset region between the drain electrode and the channel was devised. This method is called a lightly doped drain (LDD), \nin which the parasitic resistance decreases and the drain field increases with the doping concentration. Therefore, a moderately low doping concentration results in a low drain field and low parasitic resistance, thereby reducing Ioff while maintaining Ion at a similar level. Hatano et al. reported that when LDD \nstructure is introduced, Ion in the NMOS and PMOS are similar but Ioff decreases by an order of ≈1. Also, the kink current was suppressed.\n3.2.3. Dual And Asymmetric (L- Or U-Shaped) Gate Structure\nIncreasing the number of gates between the source and drain electrodes simply divides the voltage between them and reduces the drain field, thus reducing the leakage current and suppressing the kink phenomenon. According to Proano et al., \nas the number of gates in LTPS TFT increases from 1 to 6, Ion decreases by approximately one order, whereas the leakage current decreases by two to three orders. At this time, the distances between the gates are equal. Then Vds voltage distribution along each gate varies according to the gate bias. \nTherefore, to optimize the voltage division, an asymmetric gate structure may be used that varies the distance between gates in a multiple gate structure. In the case of commercial LTPS TFTs, L- or U-shaped gates are frequently used considering non-uniformity in grain sizes and properties in LTPS.\nShin et al. showed that when an L-shaped dual-gate structure is used in sequential lateral solidification (SLS)-LTPS, Ids showed a level between the horizontally connected and the vertically connected dual-gate TFT. Also, kink current was significantly decreased.\n4. Amorphous Oxide Semiconductor Tfts 4.1. Conduction Mechanism In Amorphous Oxide Semiconductors 4.1.1. Origin Of High Conductivity\nAs mentioned in Section 2.1, the low μ originated from the absence of long-range ordering in a-Si:H made the use of a-Si:H impractical for high-end displays. LTPS, on the other hand, has much improved crystallinity (≈µm of grain size) and \nthus has high μ (≈100 cm2 V−1 s−1). However, poor uniformity and cost issues hindered LTPS from being used in large-area displays. Therefore, there have been demands on new high μ materials having both high μ and large-area scalability. Meanwhile, for the past decades, there has been numerous efforts on discovering transparent and amorphous oxides but having high μ. An important starting point of this effort was a work done by Hosono et al. in the 1990s. Their initial guess was that amorphous materials with a high conductivity should satisfy the following condition: The overlap between CB orbitals are large while the magnitude of overlap is insensitive to structural randomness. They found that heavy metal cation with the electronic configuration in a form of (n-1)d10ns0 can satisfy these conditions. Also, to ensure amorphous nature, they evaluated electrical properties of double oxides (Cd2GeO4, AgSbO3, etc.) \nrather than single oxides. However, the Hall μ was typically low. To achieve high μ (≈10 cm2 V−1 s−1), additional processes such as Li+ or H+ implantation, or annealing below crystallization temperature (≈500 °C for a-IGZO) at O2 atmosphere were required.\nMany compounds containing metal-oxygen bonds are classified as ionic oxides. To give an example of IGZO, Pauling electronegativity (EN) is 1.78 for In and 3.44 for O. Thus, large difference in EN provides ionic nature in IGZO. In the case of In2O3, a stoichiometric compound of In ([Kr] 4d105s25p1) and O ([He] 2s22p4) can be regarded as a compound from In3+ ion ([Kr] 4d10) and O2− ion ([Ar]). Therefore, it is plausible that CB \nis mainly composed of 5s orbitals while 2p orbitals consist of VB. Here, the size of 5s orbitals is much larger than that of 2p orbitals. Given that the diameter of the s orbitals is larger than the distance between the cations, overlap between adjacent s orbitals can occur (**Figure** 4a). Moreover, s orbitals has spherical shape that is highly isotropic. This makes large overlap between s orbitals possible without having long-range ordering, and results in high μe by conduction of carriers through CB. \nAlso, much deeper level of O 2p orbitals compared to In 5s orbitals give rise to a large band gap of ≈3.1 eV and a very low Ioff compared to a-Si:H. Due to the band gap larger than visible light (380–740 nm or 1.7–3.3 eV), it shows high transparency.\nIn 2004, Hosono group finally succeeded to discover a-IGZO \n(a-InGaZnO4) with high μ of ≈10 cm2 V−1 s−1.\n IGZO film was prepared by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) using InGaZnO4 target and under O2 atmosphere at room temperature, and did not undergo further processes such as annealing. PLD is preferred in terms that the stoichiometric transfer of target is possible, however, not suitable for large-scale production. Nowadays, for the mass production, a-IGZO or AOSs are deposited at room temperature in O2 atmosphere by sputtering using IGZO \ntarget. Targets are usually prepared from sintering of oxide mixtures (e.g., In2O3-Ga2O3-ZnO). AOS-based TFTs had the advantages that they could utilize previously installed lines that were designed to fabricate bottom-gate staggered structure of a-Si:H TFTs. Being amorphous in nature, AOSs are also suitable for large-scale applications that require uniformity. Also, in terms of manufacturing costs, sputtering is better than ELA. Moreover, preparation of high-quality sputtering targets can be done with ease. Therefore, AOS-based display was realized in a very short time as compared with a-Si:H and LTPS. Since \nits first applications to AM-OLED in 2006, AOS-based TFTs were adopted in mass-produced AM-LCD in 2012. Nowadays, most of commercial OLED TVs utilize AOS-based TFTs.\n4.1.2. Percolation Mechanism For Carrier Transport\nUnlike a-Si:H and LTPS, AOS exhibits distinct behavior in the carrier transport. Nomura et al. compared the electrical properties of single-crystalline IGZO (s-IGZO) and polycrystalline IGZO (poly-IGZO) to elucidate conduction mechanism in IGZO. s-IGZO was prepared by 1400 °C annealing of PLDgrown epitaxial ZnO/InGaO3(ZnO)5 on YSZ (yttria-stabilized zirconia) (111) substrate to undergo solid-phase crystallization of IGZO. poly-IGZO was obtained by direct deposition of IGZO by PLD on YSZ (111). The carrier concentration was effectively modulated by H2 annealing. Then the temperaturedependent μ was obtained by Hall measurements. First, for poly-IGZO, μ showed thermally activated behavior when the carrier concentration Ne > 1019 cm−3, and it was almost independent of temperature when Ne > 1018 cm−3. The authors interpreted that when Ne > 1018 cm−3, EF is located above CB. \nHowever, the carrier transport is limited by GBs since they trap charges and establish potential barrier. As a result, thermally activated behavior is observed.\nOn the other hand, for s-IGZO, temperature dependency on μ was large when Ne < 1018 cm−3, while μ was almost independent when Ne > 2 × 1018 cm−3. At high level of Ne, μ increased significantly with Ne, which implies degenerate conduction. Meanwhile, when Ne < Nth (≈3 × 1018 cm−3, threshold electron concentration), the conductivity showed exp(T−1/4) \n(T is a temperature) dependence. Therefore, at low carrier concentration regime, variable range hopping at the localized state is plausible. However, when Ne > 1 × 1017 cm−3, an abrupt increase in conductivity with Ne along with exp(T−1/4) \ndependence for moderate Ne can only be explained by percolation mechanism. Percolation mechanism is attributed to the potential barriers with Gaussian-type distribution (Figure 4b). \nIf Ne exceed a certain level, EF becomes located above the percolation barrier and a temperature-independent conduction occurs. Even though IGZO was single-crystalline, the authors suggested that the random distributions of Ga3+ and Zn2+ in \n(GaO)+(ZnO)5 layers be responsible for the modulation of local electronic structure around CB edge and establish statistical potential distribution. Also, for poly-IGZO, the potential barrier by grain boundary is much larger than percolation barrier that results in thermally excited behavior in the conduction of poly-IGZO. Similar to s-IGZO, a-IGZO also follow percolation mechanism in carrier transport.\n4.1.3. Role Of Constituent Atoms\nIn the case of AOSs, in general, the carrier concentration is very high. Therefore, the on/off characteristics are not good. Since the carrier originates from O-vacancy, Ga can be added to reduce carrier concentration, and although μ is lowered according to the addition of Ga, Ioff can be greatly reduced. A density functional theory (DFT) calculation by Noh et al. showed an increase in the formation energy of deep oxygen vacancy increased with the coordination number of Ga, which implies oxygen vacancy formation can be effectively suppressed by Ga addition. On the other hand, when only In2O3 is deposited, a crystalline phase is formed spontaneously. However, the addition of cations \n(Ga, Zn) of a different size from In can form a stable amorphous phase. Figure 4c shows μ of a-IGZO according to the \nratio of In, Zn, and Ga. It can be seen that the μ increases with the ratio of In and Zn but decreases with the ratio of Ga.\n4.1.4. Subgap States And The Effect On Annealing\nThe deposition of IGZO is carried out at low temperature, which inevitably generates defects during the growth process. The DOS for defects are known to be located below the shallow trap of IGZO. Since they are detrimental for the electrical properties, they should be eliminated before device operations. \nFortutely, the states can be decreased by simple annealing. \nTherefore, in general, annealing below crystallization temperature (≈300 °C) is carried out when AOS-TFTs are fabricated.\nNomura et al. evaluated the electrical properties of a-IGZO \nwith the quality of film. The a-IGZO film was prepared by PLD. Depending on the laser energy for target irradiation, the film quality can be changed. That means, low-quality (LQ) samples are produced when using low-power excimer lasers, while high-quality (HQ) samples are produced by high-power lasers. The as-prepared LQ samples had μ of 2.5 cm2 V−1 s−1, and it was improved approximately fourfold (≈10 cm2 V−1 s−1) \nwhen annealed at 400 °C. On the other hand, annealing effect was less significant for HQ samples (μ changed from 15 to 19 cm2 V−1 s−1). Meanwhile, hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to estimate DOS of the film. It showed the subgap DOS of LQ decreased by half by annealing, from 2.6 × 1021 to 1.6 × 1021 cm−3. For HQ film, the subgap state itself is small and it decreased from 9.3 × 1020 to 5.0 × 1020 cm−3 upon annealing. Therefore, it can be inferred that the mechanism of annealing-induced μ improvement is largely based on subgap DOS reduction (Figure 4d). Also, due to lowered subgap states by annealing, SS can be improved and operation voltage can become smaller. Meanwhile, the obtained subgap DOS is located at >1 eV deeper than EF. The large DOS can make Fermi level pinning (FLP) at ≈1.5 eV above VB edge at reverse bias. In this case, subgap DOS is approximately two orders of magnitude larger than the hole concentration that can be induced by applying gate bias. Therefore, they conclude that the p-type conduction is hardly attained in AOSs (DOSs beneath CB is as small as ≈1018 cm−3,\n making electron conduction possible). Also, conduction of holes is highly unlikely, which results in greatly suppressed Ioff in AOS-based TFTs.\nTo understand the origin of each subgap state in a-IGZO, \nKamiya et al. conducted pseudo-band structure calculation for stoichiometric a-IGZO (sa-IGZO), crystalline IGZO (c-IGZO), \nand oxygen-deficient a-IGZO (oa-IGZO). Interestingly, saIGZO had no subgap states, which was also observed in the case of c-IGZO. The dispersion in the CB was very large (also effective mass for electron is small) in both sa-IGZO and c-IGZO, \nimplying the transport of electrons are not highly affected by the order of IGZO. However, for VB, dispersion was very small for sa-IGZO while it was little small for c-IGZO. This indicates that a break in the covalent hybridization of directional O 2p orbitals in sa-IGZO results in strong localization of VB, which is constituted mainly of O 2p orbitals. For oa-IGZO, deep and fully occupied (VO\n0) states were found to locate at 0.4–1 eV \nabove VB edge (deep donor state at Figure 4e). Also, oa-IGZO \nshowed large reduction in dispersion of the lowest unoccupied bands at ≈0.6 eV compared to sa-IGZO. This implies that the \n0 may break the coherency in CB edge, and possibly make small but localized state near CB edge (shallow donor state at Figure 4e).\n4.2. Novel Device Structures\n4.2.1. Doping Method for Amorphous Oxide Semiconductors Unlike a-Si:H or LTPS, highly doping AOSs by incorporating impurity atoms is not well established and hard to be achieved. It is due to ionic nature of AOSs that the addition or elimination of electrons may not contribute to the change in formal charge. That might be a reason for the commercial AOS-based TFTs adopt both bottom-gate, staggered structure and top-gate, self-aligned structures. Indeed, the doping is possible by a simple plasma treatment. Park et al. fabricated a bottom-gate staggered structure using a-IGZO as an active layer. Whole surface of the as-deposited a-IGZO was treated by Ar plasma, and after that source and drain electrode were deposited. After plasma treatment, the carrier concentration increased from 1014 to 1020–1021 cm−3, and the field effect mobility (μFE) increased from 3.3 to 9.1 cm2 V−1 s−1. They then annealed the samples in air and measured the resistivity. However, they found that resistivity increased more than three orders of magnitude while the composition of cations detected by XPS was not changed. Therefore, they proposed that energetic Ar ion during plasma treatment would preferentially sputter oxygen atoms in a-IGZO. This makes oxygen deficiencies in a-IGZO, which could contribute to an increase the carrier concentration.\nPark et al. evaluated the performance of a-IGZO TFTs using highly doped a-IGZO as an ohmic contact layer. Top-gate, coplanar and self-aligned TFTs were fabricated and the a-IGZO \nlayer that contact with source and drain electrode was selectively exposed to Ar plasma. The extracted μFE was 5 cm2 V−1 s−1. \nTo elucidate the mechanism of doping, the authors analyzed secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) and Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS). From SIMS analysis, contrary to previous reports by Park et al., the oxygen concentration among various samples were similar, which implies In–O bond is just broken and results in segregation of In on the surface. RBS analysis also confirms that the composition was changed up to ≈6 nm in depth. For sheet resistance measurements, regions up to ≈40 nm in depth were affected by plasma treatment.\nAhn et al. fabricated bottom-gate, self-aligned a-IGZO TFTs. \nThey compared the effect of Ar and H2 plasma treatment on the contact region of active layer with source and drain electrodes. When plasma was treated, the carrier concentration dramatically increased from 1014 cm−3 to 9.5 × 1019 cm−3 and 1.5 ×\n1020 cm−3 for Ar and H2 plasma treated samples, respectively. \nFrom SIMS profile of H and OH, they found that the concentration of H and OH also significantly increased up to ≈50 nm depth. This can be explained by diffusion of H, not by sputtering of O atoms by H since momentum transfer by light H \natoms during plasma treatment is very low. Thus, H atoms may act as a shallow donor. Therefore, unlike Ar plasma treatment that affects only up to shallow depth (≈5 nm), H2 plasma treatment was more effective to decrease Rc (128 and 75 Ω cm for Ar and H2 plasma treated samples, respectively) and increase µFE (4.27 and 7.27 cm2 V−1 s−1 for Ar and H2 plasma treated samples, respectively). If plasma treatment or UV treatment is not performed, the Schottky barrier can be formed and that lead to an increase in Rc. Extraction of specific Rc showed linear relationship between Rc and ϕ of electrode materials (i.e., \nsmaller ϕ of electrodes results in smaller Rc). In that case, for Ti, possible formation of oxidized interfacial layer may lead to a broad range of Rc.\nMeanwhile, since AOSs are transparent, it is possible to fabricate fully self-aligned double-gate TFTs by UV exposure (transmittance over 70% at 365 nm) from the back side to pattern top-gate. The double-gate structure shows improved bias stability and enhanced carrier μ than single-gate structures. With the Ar plasma treatment for the contact region and injection of H atoms by PECVD-SiNx passivation, He et al. \nextracted saturation μ of 11.3, 9, and 4.2 cm2 V−1 s−1 for doublegate, top-gate, and bottom-gate structures, respectively, and explained that the enhanced μ is attributed to reduced roughness scattering by lowered vertical electric field. Practically, SiNx as GI is not favored because of small band gap-induced large bias instability and not good interface properties.\n4.2.2. Low-Temperature Polysilicon Oxide\nRecently, low-temperature polysilicon oxide (LTPO) was emerged as a platform for high-end displays demanding low power consumptions (e.g., smart watch, smart phone) and applied in commercial products. LTPO is not new materials, but the combination of LTPS and AOS technology. Typically, LTPO consists of LTPS-TFT backplane for peripheral circuit and driving TFTs, and embedded AOS TFTs for switching TFTs \n(Figure 4f). Therefore, low-frequency driving is possible due to very low leakage current of AOS-TFT, while the power consumption can be low by high μ LTPS and low-frequency driving scheme. Also, the peripheral circuit size can become smaller by LTPS, which is advantageous for slim bezels. One of the key issues to be solved for the realization of LTPO is the control of hydrogen diffusion. Plenty of hydrogen is used to passivate defects at grain and within grain boundaries. However, they can make bond with AOS and change DOS originated from oxygen vacancies. This ultimately can shift Vth of AOSs, emphasizing the importance of hydrogen concentration control during LTPS \n4.3. Bias Stress Instability\nLike a-Si:H, AOSs are sensitive to the bias stress conditions. \nAn initial work by Suresh et al. showed that the ΔVth with the stress time is parallel without change in SS or μFE.\n As mentioned in Section 2.3, this is typically observed in a-Si:H when charge trapping is more dominant than defect creations. \nWhen positive bias is applied, Vth was moved toward the positive direction with time, indicating electrons are trapped at the interface between channel and GI or the electrons are injected \n![10_image_1.png](10_image_1.png)\nto GI. Applying negative bias did not show any effects since \n![10_image_0.png](10_image_0.png)\nall the carriers in the channel were depleted. In terms of ΔVth value with the growth condition, a-IGZO deposited at high O2 pressure showed low ΔVth since the intrinsic concentration of carriers (from oxygen vacancy) was low. Similar result was also reported by Ji et al. They tested various samples of a-IGZO \npost-annealed at different O2 pressures under negative bias illumination stress (NBIS). Unlike negative stress test in dark conditions, light illumination excites oxygen vacancies and generate free carriers, and this largely shifts ΔVth in a negative direction. When oxygen pressure was high (or low oxygen vacancy concentration), ΔVth to the negative direction was small. \nTherefore, the authors proposed that photo-induced transition of oxygen vacancy (from VO to VO\n2+) is responsible for NBIS \ninstability. Nomura et al. evaluated ΔVth for the as-deposited, post-annealed at 400 °C in both dry and wet O2 atmosphere. \nWhen the thermal decomposition spectra were measured, unannealed samples showed a large increase in shallow traps due to metastable bonds which easily desorb under stress conditions (Zn-O, H, OH-related species). They suggested that the annealing greatly suppress this phenomenon and make the samples less susceptible to the bias stress.\nSimilar to a-Si:H, stretched-exponential models are widely used to interpret bias instability in AOSs. Lee et al. showed that the conventional logarithmic model of ΔVth that is derived solely from charge trapping mechanism may not agree well with the experimental data in AOSs. As mentioned earlier, logarithmic time dependence model assumes no redistribution of trapped charges in GI, suggesting stretched-exponential models may fit better to the AOSs.\n5. Transition Metal Dichalcogenides Tfts 5.1. Growth Strategy Of Tmdcs For Display Tft Applications 5.1.1. Low-Temperature Growth Of Tmdcs\nThe deposition temperature of a TFT channel material is limited by the temperature that the substrate can withstand. \nAlthough the composition of the substrate is tunable to enhance thermal stability, a commercially available substrate is designed to endure up to ≈600 °C due to cost issues. However, the process temperature of common growth methods as thermal CVD is typically beyond the limit, which is 700–\n1100 °C (**Figure** 5a,b). Since lowering the growth temperature has a trade-off in the film quality and growth speed, special actions have to be taken to grow high-quality films with reduced thermal energy: 1) grow at low pressures, 2) shift an equilibrium using Le Chatelier's principles, 3) utilize nucleation promoters, 4) reduce an activation energy for a reaction, and 5) enhance the surface diffusion rate.\nThe first strategy is based on the deposition limited by mass transport of chemical species at moderately reduced pressures, where the mass transfer coefficient is inversely proportional to the square root of pressure. Under this strategy, Mun et al. reported MoS2 with a grain size of 100–200 nm grown for 8 h at 250 °C and a moderate pressure of 30 torr. Here, the growth temperature is more than 250 °C lower than that of \n![11_image_0.png](11_image_0.png)\ntypical CVD (>500 °C). The second strategy is based on the fact that the chemical reaction proceeds in a direction maintaining its equilibrium. That is, the forward reaction is likely to occur if the concentration of the reactants becomes higher. Therefore, increasing the concentration of reactants during the deposition will assist the formation of MoS2. When using a solid precursor, this can be achieved by lowering the pressure to promote its evaporation (droplet evaporation theory), \nthereby increasing the partial pressure. Alternatively, it can be done by using large amounts of precursors or easily decomposable precursors at low temperatures (i.e., having high vapor pressures). Through this approach, Ji et al. reported the growth of MoS2 with a crystallinity of ≈1 µm when grown for 30–60 min at 530 °C and 0.23 torr using typical precursors for CVD-MoS2 (MoO3 and sulfur). In the case of the third strategy, when aromatic molecules are added, they evaporate and condensate to form heterogeneous nuclei. This lowers the barrier to nucleation and can promote low-temperature growth. In the fourth case, since the reaction rate constant is proportional to exp (−Ea/kT) (where Ea is the activation energy for the reaction), lowering Ea by adjusting the reaction path can lower the growth temperature. For example, in a study by Gong et al., the growth of MoS2 with a crystallinity of over 100 µm at 450 °C is shown when (NH4)2MoO4 is used as a precursor. The decrease in Ea was demonstrated through a DFT calculation. Similarly, growth assisted by Au catalysts or alkali metal halide catalysts can be classified into such examples. Thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC) measurements indicate that the mixing of alkali metal halides with metal oxides pushes the melting point of most transition metal oxides to within the range of 600–800 °C.[80b] In this way, all TMDCs on the periodic table can be grown within this temperature range, although alkali metals that are introduced during the reaction have a significantly bad effect on the reliability of the device, and thus have limitations in their actual application. The fifth strategy can be achieved by utilizing a liquid substrate that can take advantage of the rapid movement of atoms adsorbed on the surface. Zhou et al. reported the synthesis of crystalline 2D \nGaSe and 2D GaxIn1-xSe at low temperatures of 100–150 °C \nusing Ga and In-Ga alloys with a melting point of ≈30 °C.\nWang et al. was able to synthesize tens of micrometer-sized Ga2In4S9 ternary alloys at low temperatures of 300–450 °C by heating the In-Ga alloy (In:Ga = 1:3) at 950 °C and supplying sulfur. Here, small binding energy between Ga or In and a chalcogen atom may also contribute to lower the growth temperature. Similarly, when Te (melting point of 450 °C) is mixed with W (melting point of 3422 °C), W is dissolved in Te at 450 °C and forms an alloy with W, thus synthesizing WS2 at a low temperature of 500 °C becomes possible. Despite the relatively low growth temperature, highly crystalline (≈50 µm) \nMeanwhile, similar to the growth of a-Si:H, the growth of a-MoS2 can be achieved at a low temperature using PECVD. \nAhn et al. prepared a 4 inch PI substrate with 1 nm (five to six layers) of Mo deposited using an electron beam evaporator.\nWhen plasma is formed, the injected H2S molecules collide with Ar+ ions, forming H2S+ ions. These H2S+ ions can then be accelerated in the sheath region located near the growth substrate. The accelerated ions can collide with Mo, and finally a MoS2 film is created. The thickness of the film was measured as 3–4 nm (five to six layers); however, the domain size of the film grown at 150 and 300 °C was 5 and 7 nm, respectively. This implies that, similar to a-Si, a uniform film can be \nobtained over a large-area using PECVD, although the quality of MoS2 has a certain limitation.\nAs in the case of LTPS, it is clear that the crystallization of as-grown a-MoS2 using a laser can improve the quality of the a-MoS2. This approach was applied by Vilá et al. (Figure 5c).\nUnder high vacuum conditions, a diode-pumped continuous wave laser (532 nm) was continuously focused on the sputtered a-MoS2 on a SiO2/Si micro-pillar to heat the overall substrate, which subsequently annealed the entire a-MoS2 film through heat conduction. The a-MoS2 underwent a solid-state phase transformation during isothermal heating, resulting in crystallized 2H-MoS2. By monitoring the reference Si peak shift from room temperature, the crystallization temperature of a-MoS2 can be inferred. The integrated Raman peak intensity of E2g1 and A1g over time can then provide information on crystallization kinetics. From an Arrhenius plot for a rate constant, the energy barrier for crystallization was estimated to be 1.03 eV per atom, which implies that sulfur diffusion (1.04 eV per atom for diffusion in MoS2 as predicted through DFT calculations) \nmay play a crucial role in crystallization.\nAlong with laser sources, xenon flash lamps with a broad light spectrum have also been spotlighted as a scalable and cost-effective tool for a novel light-material interaction owing to their large-area processability and excellent compatibility to the roll-to-roll process. Kim et al. employed a large-scale (>6.25 cm2) intensely pulsed light source to induce a controlled photonic crystallization of an a-MoS2 film. The a-MoS2 sputtered on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was treated through a flash lamp process in air, leading to a phase transformation into 2H-MoS2 without a decomposition of the polymer substrate. However, flash-induced MoS2 heating upon crystallization causes a mismatch of the thermal expansion coefficient between the MoS2 and PDMS, which results in a uniform wrinkling of the MoS2/polymer.\n5.1.2. Uniform And Scalable Growth Of Tmdcs\nTypically, thin film deposition in the semiconductor process takes place at low pressure. This is because not a masstransport-limited growth but a surface-reaction-limited growth occurs at low pressure, thus enabling highly uniform and conformal growth of thin films. Therefore, for the purpose of uniformity in TMDC growth, low-pressure CVD has been widely used. Transport phenomena simulations also support that the growth at low pressure is more advantageous in uniformity than high pressure in the layered material growth. To date, low-pressure growth has been reported to enable growth of up to 4 inch (7.5 torr) and 6 inch (20 torr) wafers in metalorganic CVD (MOCVD) and CVD. Also, uniformly coating the precursor on the surface can achieve a large-area, uniform growth. By means of reacting predeposited WOx film under Se atmosphere, growth of up to 8 inch wafers (1–10 torr) has been reported. Alternatively, disposing uniformly coated (or deposited) precursor substrates facing the growth substrate can be used. This approach is similar to the use of multiple rotating cylindrical target arrays to form uniform films for the large-area deposition of a-IGZO. Using this method, uniform growth up to 1.5 × 3 cm2 at the atmospheric pressure \n(760 torr) and up to 6 × 14 cm2 at low pressure has been \n![12_image_0.png](12_image_0.png) reported (Figure 5d). Self-limited reactions can also be used to form uniform thin films. When annealed after coating a mixed solution of (NH4)2MoO4 and KOH on the surface, the migration of -OH groups to the MoS2 (001) surface became thermodynamically stable, resulting in a uniform thin film without ad-layers. In addition, when Au foil is used as a substrate, an atomically thin layer is obtained through the low solubility of Mo or W to Au. Ad-layer growth rate on the as-grown MoS2 or WS2 is very low, which results in a strictly monolayer.[80a] Using methods based on self-limiting growth mechanisms (atomic layer deposition or ALD, inhibitor-utilizing ALD or iALD) yield uniform films regardless of the substrate size (Figure 5e), and up to a 6 inch wafer level growth has been reported. Although a suitable method on a labscale, molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) is also possible for the growth of a uniform thin film, which is currently reported up to 2 inches.\n5.1.3. Thickness-Controlled Growth Of Tmdcs\nThe electrical properties of TMDCs are highly sensitive to the thickness due to the atomically thin nature. In the case of a thick layer, μ decreases by a low interlayer conductivity, while for thin layers, lowering in μ is attributed to the scattering by influence from the interface. Therefore, thickness-controlled growth is essential to modulate the electrical properties. However, the possibility of the layer-controlled growth depends on the physical properties of the TMDCs. There are two governing processes for the growth: one is nucleation and the other is the growth itself. If the growth rate is dominant, the number of layers is limited because a small and thin nucleus is formed.[80b]\nIf the ripening rate during the nucleation process is dominant, multilayer growth is preferred owing to the large nuclei formed. This may explain the layer number tendency of CVDMoX2 (X = S, Se, Te) that is typically observed. Since sulfur has a higher vapor pressure than Se and Te at the same temperature, the growth of MoS2 occurs faster than MoSe2 and MoTe2. \nAs a result, monolayer growth is preferred for MoS2, while multilayer growth is frequently observed for MoTe2. Therefore, the type of TMDC should be carefully chosen to control the number of layers.\nMeanwhile, layer-controlled growth is possible even if the layered growth might be not preferred for certain TMDCs. However, there is a trade-off between the thickness and the quality of the film. Taking MoS2 as an example, because the surface energy of the edge is ≈130 times larger than the basal plane, after one layer is grown on the substrate, the next layer becomes difficult to grow due to a change in the surface energy of the growth substrate. Therefore, the as-grown layer must be defective to allow nucleation and multilayer growth to occur. This process is achieved at the expense of the film quality. In addition, nuclei formation during the growth process is achieved by either seed-mediation (PTAS, etc.) or self-seeding by a cluster or core-shell formation. During this process, however, a 10–20 nm sized seed is inevitably formed, and even though it looks flat and uniform when observed through optical microscopy, its impact on the electrical characteristics can be \n![13_image_1.png](13_image_1.png)\ndetrimental. Therefore, meeting high-quality and layer-controlled growth at the same time is extremely challenging.\nVarious methods have been proposed for layer control in sulfide compounds, which are relatively disadvantageous for layered growth. Jeon et al. reported that the thickness of the MoS2 can be controlled in mono-, bi-, and tri-layers by increasing the interaction of the MoS2 precursor with the substrate through O2 plasma treatment of the substrate surface.\nSong et al. obtained mono-, bi-, and tri-layer WS2 through the sulfurization of plasma-enhanced ALD-deposited WO3 with H2S. Lee et al. obtained 2, 4, 8, and 12 layers of MoS2 when a thick Mo thin film was deposited and sulfurized with H2S. However, the grain size measured by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) was extremely small (10–20 nm). In a precursor deposition-based method, volume expansion occurs owing to a deformation of the lattice structure during sulfurization. When the thickness of Mo film exceeds 3 nm, vertical growth occurs and thereby releasing the strain. Zafar et al. reported that increasing the feeding rate of sulfur promotes the formation of a large WOxS2-y clusters in the gas phase, increasing the number of layers of WS2 up to four. He et al. reported that the thickness of MoS2 can be controlled from a monolayer to up to 30 layers by periodically inserting and removing the substrate using a motor and modulating the number of cycles (Figure 5f). This method has an advantage of forming a uniform thin film (1.5 × 1.5 and 0.6 × 4.7 cm2) in the lateral direction because it is exposed to a uniform growth environment. However, a non-uniformity of the crystal size was observed in the direction perpendicular to the substrate. The grain size of the first layer was several micrometers, but the grain size decreased as the number of layers increased.\n5.2. Mobility Engineering Strategy Of Tmdcs For Tft Applications 5.2.1. Generalized Mobility Model For Tmdcs\nμ refers to the ability of a charge carrier to drift in the direction of an electric field when an electric field is applied. Based on a formula, μ represents the ratio of the applied electric field to the average drift velocity, which is mainly affected by a scattering from the Coulomb interactions among the charged impurities in a lattice and charge carriers, and also from the thermal vibrations in the lattice. Here, lattice vibration from thermal energy is periodic and can be described as quantized particles, which are called phonons. The phonon mode is divided into an optical mode, in which adjacent atoms move in the opposite direction, and an acoustic mode, in which adjacent atoms move in the same direction. According to the directions of the vibration and wave propagation, they are divided into longitudinal \n(parallel) and transverse waves (perpendicular). Meanwhile, if we consider a model where atoms are connected by springs, in optical mode the spring is stretched more than in acoustic mode, resulting in a higher elastic potential energy. Therefore, when the temperature is low, the scattering by the acoustic phonons predominantly occurs, and when the temperature is high, excitation of the optical phonons contributes largely to the scattering.\nSo far, numerous models have been proposed to predict the \n![13_image_0.png](13_image_0.png)\nintrinsic μ in bulk semiconductors. A similar approach can be used for the atomically thin 2D materials, however, μ must be newly assessed because the band structure changes as the scale decreases to nanometer level and the contribution of the surface properties increases. Kaasbjerg et al. theoretically predicted the phonon-limited μ in a single-layer MoS2.\n In this case, at low temperature regime (e.g., 100 K), μ is predicted to be μ ≈ T−γ where γ = 1 because the influence of the longitudinal acoustic (LA) and transverse acoustic (TA) phonons is important at low temperatures. As the temperature increases, the transverse optical (TO) phonons, the homopolar phonons \n(HPs), and the Fröhlich scattering (scattering by the longitudinal optical phonons) become stronger, and thus γ is predicted to be 1.69 at room temperature. For reference, γ is known to be \n≈2.6 in a bulk material. Meanwhile, according to Matthiessen's rule, μ can be expressed as the sum of the reciprocal of μ by each contributing mechanism because μ is proportional to the scattering rate of the charge carriers (**Figure** 6a). As a result, μ of a single-layer MoS2 at room temperature was estimated to be 410 cm2 V−1 s−1 when considering five phonon scattering mechanisms. Radisavljevic et al. used a double-gate structure to improve μ significantly (≈200 cm2 V−1 s−1) compared to previous reports. In this structure, the homopolar mode \n(out-of-plane vibrational mode) is quenched. When the contribution of the homopolar mode was excluded, the estimated μ was ≈70 cm2 V−1 s−1. Therefore, impurity screening from the deposition of a high dielectric constant (κ) GI was expected to contribute significantly to the increase in the experimental μ. In addition, for the scattering caused by impurities to prevail, the distance between the impurities must be on the same order or smaller as the mean free path of the phonons. This corresponds to the minimum impurity concentration of ≈5 × 1011 cm−2. As a result of this strong doping, the authors suggested that the typical mechanically exfoliated MoS2 has a low μ.\nWhen a high-κ GI such as HfO2 is used, surface optical (SO) \nphonon (or remote polar phonon) scattering occurs. This scattering is induced by the optical phonon mode of the thin film with a high-κ, in which oscillating dipoles are formed. At this time, because the electric field induced from the dipole is an evanescent field that cannot propagate to a large distance, the electric field is exponentially reduced with the distances, and thus its influence is limited near the interface of a high-κ GI. \nTherefore, in Si-based devices, SO phonons are typically influential when an inversion layer is formed. Meanwhile, TMDCs are largely affected by SO phonon scattering due to their atomically thin nature. To evaluate this, Ma et al. predicted μ when MoS2 was in contact with several different dielectrics. At this time, a single layer of MoS2 was assumed to be surrounded by an insulating film of infinite thickness, and thus the effect of the dielectric was slightly overestimated. Assuming that a charge has formed from an impurity in the MoS2, when a high-κ GI \nis used, the electric field from the charge is screened to reduce the carrier scattering by the impurity. In addition, a screening effect was observed when the concentration of free carriers was high. On the other hand, as κ value of GI increases, the angular frequency of the SO phonon (ωSO) decreases, which increases the SO phonon scattering effect. This scattering effect is negligible at low temperature (T < 100 K) because the SO phonons \n![14_image_0.png](14_image_0.png)\nare not populated at low temperatures, but are dominant over impurity scattering at room temperature. For example, if no SO \nphonon scattering occurs in the SiO2/MoS2/HfO2 structure, μ is expected to be ≈130 (when NI = 6 × 1012 cm−2, ns = 1.15 × 1013 cm−2) and ≈1400 cm2 V−1 s−1 (when NI = 2 × 1012 cm−2, ns = 1 × 1013 cm−2). However, when SO phonon scattering is present, μ is reduced to ≈50 and ≈70 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. \nHere, NI is the concentration of impurities, and ns is the concentration of free carriers in MoS2. In this case, when only SO \nphonon scattering is considered, μ is ≈70 cm2 V−1 s−1. However, μph, which considers the intrinsic phonon-limited μ and SO \nphonon scattering, decreases as κ increases. For extreme conditions of air/MoS2/air or free-standing MoS2, the value of μph can be improved to ≈10 000 cm2 V−1 s−1. By contrast, when the concentration of impurities is high (>1012 cm−2), an impurity scattering becomes μ-limiting factor and thus dielectrics are barely influential to μ. Therefore, the authors suggested that the samples be clean and have a low concentration of impurities and a GI with a moderate κ value (e.g., h-BN are AlN) to achieve high μ.\nMeanwhile, the more polarizable the M-O bond becomes, the larger the SO phonon scattering and the smaller ωSO becomes. \nBecause EN difference between the two elements determines the ionic characteristic of the bond, EN of the elements can provide a guideline for finding a GI suitable for TMDC materials. For example, in the case of an oxide, considering Pauling EN, SiO2 (ΔENSi,O = 1.54) has a ωSO1 of 55.6, whereas Al2O3 (ΔENAl,O = 1.83) has a ωSO1 of 48.18, ZrO2 (ΔENZr,O = 2.11) has a ωSO1 of 16.67, and HfO2 (ΔENHf,O = 2.14) has a ωSO1 of 12.4. For nitride, BN (ΔENB,N = 1.00) has a ωSO1 of 93.07, whereas AlN (ΔENAl,N = 1.43) has a ωSO1 of 81.4. Here, assuming a spring model, the angular frequency ω between two atoms is proportional to (1/mA + 1/mB)\n−0.5 (where mA and mB are the atomic weight of atoms A and B, respectively), and thus the smaller the atomic weight, the higher ωSO can be.\nThe above results suggest that a multilayer GI can be effective in improving μ characteristics when compared to a single layer GI. Li et al. reported that μ can be increased through the use of a stack structure of GI. To compare the electrical characteristics with GI, a dual-gate device using 4.2 nm thick MoS2 as a channel was fabricated. SiO2 was used as the bottom-gate GI and Al2O3/HfO2 was used as the top-gate GI. μ measured at 300 K was 55 cm2 V−1 s−1 with the SiO2 insulating film, but increased to 81 cm2 V−1 s−1 with Al2O3/HfO2. The enhanced μ is due to a dielectric screening effect when using a high-κ GI, while good interfacial properties of Al2O3 with MoS2 (as compared to those of SiO2) are satisfied at the same time. In fact, low-frequency 1/f noise measurement indicated that the noise amplitude was reduced by more than 40% in the device with Al2O3/HfO2 GI, \nand the extracted trap density was reduced by approximately twofold. Similarly, Yu et al. reported that μFE of a single-layer MoS2 at room temperature can be increased to 148 cm2 V−1 s−1\n![15_image_1.png](15_image_1.png)\nusing high-κ oxide (10 nm)/SiO2 (285 nm) multilayer GI.\nThe increase in μ was mainly due to the suppression of the CI scattering by using high-κ GIs. As the κ value increased while CI density remains constant, μ increased in order of SiO2 (81 cm2 V−1 s−1), Al2O3 (113 cm2 V−1 s−1), and HfO2 (148 cm2 V−1 s−1). Here, μFE can also be improved by controlling the carrier density by gate voltage.\nMeanwhile, point defects (e.g., a vacancy) and line defects \n(grain boundaries) are present in TMDCs. Majority of them are sulfur vacancy, which is known to contribute to CI scattering and short-range scattering. Yu et al. reported that μFE can be improved by inhibiting the scattering at the vacancies through a passivation of the sulfur vacancy. In this case, (3-mercaptopropyl)trimethoxysilane (MPS) was used for passivation of the sulfur vacancy. When MPS reacted with a single layer MoS2 and subsequent annealing is carried out, the sulfur vacancy was replaced with sulfur. From HRTEM images, the density of the sulfur vacancy was found to decrease from ≈6.5 × 1013 to ≈1.6 × 1013 cm−2, which reduces the CI scattering. Reduction in trap density also led to a decrease in the short-range scattering rate, then μ increased by approximately threefold, from 26 to 81 cm2 V−1 s−1. Lin et al. reported five defects, namely, VSe\n(selenium vacancy), SeW (tungsten vacancy substituted by W), VW (W vacancy), impurities (e.g., Fe, Mo, and Au emitted from a stainless susceptor or quartz tube during the growth), and Se interstitials when measuring scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images at 5 K in MOCVD-WSe2.\n Scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) showed that VSe, SeW, and VW form mid-gap states within the band gap, whereas impurities and Se interstitials do not form mid-gap states, and do not affect the electrical properties. When the as-grown WSe2 was annealed at 850 °C under H2Se atmosphere, VSe and SeW decreased by approximately tenfold, and VW was mostly eliminated. As a result, 800 °C grown WSe2 with reduced defects showed μFE of 29.4 cm2 V−1 s−1, whereas 650 °C grown WSe2 with high defect density showed much lower μFE of 0.083 cm2 V−1 s−1.\n5.2.2. Effect Of Thickness On The Mobility Of Tmdcs\nIn general, μ of an atomically thin TMDC is much lower than a bulk material. Das et al. insisted that this phenomenon is in part due to the Schottky barrier between the metal and TMDC material, but mostly affected by scattering from a charged impurity (CI), the contribution of the non-uniform distribution of charges due to charge screening, and the contribution of the interlayer resistance. To explain this, a resistor network model was introduced. According to this model, in the case of a bottom-gate device, when the gate voltage is applied, charges are accumulated in the GI. The charge accumulated in the GI \nbecomes Cox(Vgs–Vth), in which image charges are induced in the MoS2 layer. If there is no screening effect, the charges are evenly distributed in MoS2. If a screening is present, the electric field applied to the charges on the far side from the gate is screened by the charges gathering on the near side, and the amount of charge induced decreases away from the gate. By contrast, the source and drain electrodes are located at the top, which is directly connected to the top MoS2 layer. To access the bottom MoS2 layer, the interlayer resistances (Rint) caused by the van der Waals (vdW) gap must be overcome (Figure 6b). In addition, resistance occurs even when electrons flow in MoS2 laterally, and thus the flow of electrons can be described through the network connection. Because scattering by CI also affected by a screening effect, the scattering effect decreases as it moves away from the bottom-gate (i.e., as it is nearer to the source and drain). That is, μ in the i-th layer from the bottomgate can be expressed as Equations (3) and (4).\n$$\\frac{Q_{i}}{Q_{i-1}}=\\exp\\biggl{(}-\\frac{d_{\\rm ML}}{\\lambda}\\biggr{)}\\tag{1}$$\n![15_image_0.png](15_image_0.png)\n$$\\mu_{i}=\\mu_{1}+(\\mu_{-}-\\mu_{1})\\Biggl{(}1-\\exp\\Biggl{(}-\\frac{(i-1)d_{\\rm ML}}{\\lambda}\\Biggr{)}\\Biggr{)}\\tag{4}$$\nwhere Qi is the charge induced in the i-th layer, μ1 is the μ in the first layer, μ∞ is the maximum μ when there is no scattering effect, dML is the thickness of a single layer, and λ is the Thomas-Fermi screening length.\nFor a 13-layer MoS2 TFT with Sc as source and drain electrodes, Sc has a low ϕ and thus Rc owing to Schottky barrier height (SBH) of 30 meV was estimated as 0.65 kΩ µm. However, the measured Rc was much larger than this. This indicates that mechanisms other than SBH contribute to the Rc. When fitted using a resistive network model, values of dML = 0.6 nm, λ = 7 nm, Rint = 2400 Ω µm, μ1 = 30 cm2 V−1 s−1, and μ∞ =\n800 cm2 V−1 s−1 were extracted. When Vgs–Vth = 1 V, the position of the \"hot-spot\" where the current value in each layer is at maximum was at approximately ninth layer from the bottom (Figure 6c). This means that, for the current to flow, it must pass through the two or three layers of the vdW gap, and Rc at this time was as high as ≈10 kΩ µm. By contrast, when Vgs– Vth = 5 V, the position of the hot-spot was at approximately tenth layer from the bottom, and Rc was as low as ≈5 kΩ µm because it passed through a vdW gap of one or two layers. A \nhot-spot is formed close to the contact side when Vgs increases, implying a decrease in Rc.\nWhen the thickness of MoS2 increases, the charge distribution becomes biased to the source and drain electrodes. If there is no Rint, a decrease in CI screening results in a saturation in μ with the thickness. However, when Rint is present, charges nearer to the source and drain electrodes contribute more to the charge transport. Since the amount of induced charges at the upper layers becomes smaller with thickness due to Thomas–Fermi screening, the increase in thickness results in a decrease in μ. Experimentally, when μ of MoS2 is measured by varying the thickness from 2 to 70 nm, μFE is 29 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 2 nm but increases to ≈185 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 10 nm, and again decreases to ≈36 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 36 nm. This shows that the optimized thickness of MoS2 for a high μ is 6–12 nm. In the case of graphene with a small λ and a small Rint, the charge is mostly collected at the bottom when gate bias is applied.[112a]\nIn this case, the resistance required to access the bottom layer is small, and thus the hot-spot is mainly located at the bottom. Therefore, a device with a single layer performs better than a multilayer device.\nSimilarly, Zheng et al. reported that by using CVD-grown pyramidal MoS2, μ can be increased by lowering Rc.\nof the synthesized MoS2 was 20–30 µm, with an exposed edge width of 200–600nm. Interestingly, μ of the pyramid structure was at least 1.4-fold (four layers) to up to fivefold (one to three layers) larger than that of exfoliated samples with the same thickness. This is because the electrodes are in contact with the edges of each layer, allowing electrons to be transferred to the lower layer without overcoming the interlayer resistance (Rint).\nLi et al. proposed a model for a lopsided carrier concentration distribution, as previously proposed for Si and GaAs, to describe the CI scattering with the thickness of the MoS2 (Figure 6d).\nThe concentration distribution is a function of Vg and the thickness. According to this function, as the thickness of the MoS2 increases in the back-gated structure, the charge is dispersed and the peak point of the charge concentration moves away from the gate. At this time, because the Coulomb scattering rate is inversely proportional to the square of the distance, CI scattering decreases when the thickness increases. In addition, as Vgs–Vth increases, the carrier is distributed closer to the gate, and thus the CI scattering is reduced; however, as the Fröhlich scattering by the longitudinal optical phonons (48 meV) increases, μ increases initially but soon reached to the saturation (Figure 6e and polar optical phonon in Figure 6f). At this time, when the MoS2 is thin, the effect of the CI is significant, and thus the Vgs–Vth required for CI shielding becomes extremely large. \nTherefore, it can explain that μ is not saturated within the limited range of Vgs–Vth. By contrast, the authors evaluated μFE with the number of layers while varying the gate position and the GIs in a double-gate device. In a bottom-gate device, when the topgate GI is HfO2, μFE in a single layer increased by approximately twofold compared with that in air. However, as the number of layers increases, the upper part of the MoS2 acts as an insulating film (κMoS2 = 17.8 ≈ κHfO2), and the effect of improving μFE by the high-κ GI is almost disappeared. In a top-gate device, the charge accumulated at the top side of MoS2 enhances the CI shielding effect, increasing the μFE of each sample by ≈50%. \nHowever, even with the top-gate structures and high-κ GIs, the single-layer μFE increased by up to threefold, which is still several times smaller than that predicted theoretically. Therefore, the authors suggested that lowering the concentration of impurities will be more effective. Impurities are derived from gaseous adsorbates on the upper surface, residues during the device fabrication, water molecules at the interface, and unsaturated bonds of SiO2 on the lower surface. They can be removed through a post-annealing and transfer in a dry environment. It was predicted that when the concentration of impurities is reduced by tenfold, from 3 × 1012 to 0.3 × 1012 cm−2, the monolayer μFE become more than doubled.\n5.2.3. Effect Of Transition Metal And Chalcogen Combinations\nHuang et al. predicted μe at room temperature by selecting 14 types of semiconducting 1T and 1H structures from layered MX2 compounds in the International Crystal Structure Database \n(ICSD). At this time, the charge scattering originates from LA phonon scattering (μLA), optical phonon scattering (μOP), \nand piezoelectric scattering (µPZ), and it is assumed that there is no influence from impurities. Then μ can be calculated as 1/μ = 1/μLA + 1/μOP + 1/μPZ. Piezoelectric scattering indicates scattering from an interaction of the charge and the electric field \n![16_image_0.png](16_image_0.png)\ngenerated when a deformation occurs in a crystal without inversion symmetry (piezoelectric crystals, such as 1H-MoS2, MoSe2, MoTe2, WS2, and WSe2). Only μLA and μOP were considered for the 1T phase crystals (HfS2, HfSe2, PtS2, PtSe2, PtTe2, SnS2, SnSe2, ZrS2, and ZrSe2), which are not piezoelectric crystals. \nInterestingly, as the difference in atomic weight between M and X increased, energy gap between optical and acoustic branch increased, and thus scattering between acoustic and optical phonon modes are suppressed, which result in an increase in thermal conductivity. Therefore, calculated μ showed the tendency of μMS2 > μMSe2 > μMTe2. For example, the predicted μ of MoS2 at room temperature was 354 cm2 V−1 s−1. However, WS2 was 1793 cm2 V−1 s−1, PtS2 was 3942 cm2 V−1 s−1, and PtSe2 was 4038 cm2 V−1 s−1, which are approximately five to ten times higher than those of MoS2. Because these compounds have a band gap of 1.2 to 2.0 eV, Ion/Ioff is also expected to be excellent. In addition, even in an undiscovered phase and ternary or quaternary compounds, there is a possibility that a layered 2D TMDC materials having a high μ and a moderate band gap exist. For this reason, the prediction of μ of these new materials has an important meaning.\n5.2.4. Effect Of Doping\nOne of the most important, but usually a poorly considered doping source is a dielectric. A dielectric can modulate the charge density in the channel layer owing to the presence of dipoles. This effect is particularly pronounced when the dielectric is non-stoichiometric. Rai et al. reported that when TiOx\n(x < 2) is used as GI, the Rc decreases from 2.9 to 180 Ω µm owing to the n-doping effect by GI, and μFE increases from 24 to 83 cm2 V−1 s−1.\n Here, GI was amorphous TiOx (x ≈ 1.5 according to XPS analysis) prepared by sol–gel method. When analyzing the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum after depositing TiOx on MoS2, the exciton peak decreases in intensity and red-shifts. This is typically observed when the electron concentration of MoS2 increases because excitons formed through photo-excitation are easily converted into negatively charged trions, which are more stable and have lower energy than excitons. Therefore, it can be inferred that TiOx has an electron donating effect. An analysis of the transfer curve shows that Vth negatively shifts and the gate modulation significantly decreases, which also means an increase in the electron concentration from n-doping. Similarly, Kang et al. reported that in the case of a back-gated device based on MOCVD-MoS2 with HfO2 as an passivation layer and SiO2 as GI, μFE is 0.3 cm2 V−1 s−1 when measured at atmospheric pressure.[88a] However, μFE improves to 12.4 cm2 V−1 s−1 after the device was left in a vacuum for 10 h, and μFE is 15.8 cm2 V−1 s−1 when it annealed in a vacuum for 24 h, which was explained by the doping effect from HfO2.\nMeanwhile, doping can also be achieved using a reducing/\noxidizing agent that can donate or withdraw the charges. Kiriya et al. showed that doping is possible when using benzyl viologen (BV). The CB edge of MoS2 (0 V vs a standard hydrogen electrode) and the reduction potential of BV (−0.79 V \nfor BV0/BV+, −0.33 V for BV+/BV2+) are located close together \nsuch that electrons can be easily transferred from BV to MoS2. \nThe transfer curve has an Ion/Ioff of 105 and Rc of 3.3 kΩ µm before doping, however, the Vgs dependence of Ids disappears after doping. That is, degenerate doping occurs in MoS2, where μFE is 24.7 cm2 V−1 s−1, the charge density is 1.2 × 1013 cm−2, and the Rc becomes approximately three times smaller \n(1.1 kΩ µm). The doping by BV makes almost no changes in the transfer characteristics even if the device is left in the air for 9 days. This is advantageous in terms of stability and doping level control in that BV can be reversibly removed in toluene.\nA doping method using vacancy-anchored molecules was devised, which considers the presence of chalcogen vacancies on the surface of the TMDC. Sim et al. proposed a charge transfer doping using thiol molecules, which has -CF3 (1H, 1H, \n2H, 2H-perfluorodecanethiol, FDT) or -NH2 (2-mercaptoethylamine, MEA) at the opposite side of -SH. In general, -NH2 acts as an electron donating group by lone pair electrons of N, and -F acts as an electron withdrawing group owing to its strong EN. When MEA is applied to pristine MoS2, an -NH2 group donate electrons to MoS2. At the same time, it assists the adsorption of O2 and H2O, which act as a p-dopant. Without annealing, the two opposite effects are canceled out, and thus the transfer curve does not change significantly. However, after annealing at 250 °C for 1 h under air, in the MEA-treated sample, Vth shifted significantly to the left (a negative shift) and Ion was greatly improved, and the charge carrier density increased to 3.7 × 1012 cm−2. However, when FDT was treated, Vth shifted to the positive, and Ion decreased significantly as the carrier density decreased by 1.8 × 1011 cm−2. Although thiolbased doping is a stable method, there is a disadvantage in that the surface roughness increased.\nOther than charge transfer doping and vacancy passivation doping, various types of doping methods are available by using AuCl3,\n alkali metal, metal carbonate, and plasma treatment. However, except for the doping by dielectrics, most are not permanent and the effect of doping significantly reduced over time.\n5.3. Contact Resistance In Tmdc Tfts 5.3.1. Origin Of Fermi Level Pinning\nμ of TMDCs predicted by the theoretical models is high enough for display TFTs, however, the value is much lower in an actual device. Among many origins, Rc is known to play major roles in μ degradations. In Section 2.2.2, it was shown that Rc of a-Si:H \nand LTPS can be significantly reduced by inserting a highly doped area between the source/drain electrode and channel. However, in the case of atomically thin TMDC, it is not easy to achieve a permanent doping, and thus the metal comes into direct contact with the TMDC. In this case, as the wave function of the metal is extended to the TMDC by metal-induced gap states (MIGS), strong FLP is observed. As a result, regardless of the contact metal, Schottky barrier is formed at the interface between TMDC channel and metal electrode (**Figure** 7a,b).\n![17_image_0.png](17_image_0.png)\nThis is also the cause of the conduction polarity that appears regardless of the type of metal electrode. For example, in MoS2, pinning occurs near the VB edge and thus it typically represents an n-type conductivity, and in WSe2, pinning occurs near the CB edge, which usually shows an ambipolar characteristics owing to narrow band gap or a p-type conductivity.\nMeanwhile, Gong et al. argued that in addition to MIGS, the intrinsic mechanism that appears between 2D semiconductors and metals also contributes to the FLP. To prove this, a DFT calculation was performed for the contacts between several metals and MoS2. The model assumed that MoS2 is pristine without any defects. Therefore, MIGS or defect-induced gap states (DIGS) mechanism could not contribute to FLP. Figure 7c shows the plane-averaged charge density difference \n(Δρ) with the distance before and after the contact is made. \nChange in the dipole moment can be obtained by integrating Δρ multiplied by distance with the distance, and the result indicates that the dipole moment at the interface was induced by the contact between metal and MoS2. This is due to the small space available for an atomically thin MoS2 to accommodate the electrons, and thus the dipole greatly reduces effective ϕ of metal by rehybridizing the metal d orbitals. In this case, as the distance between the metal and MoS2 increases, the dipole moment induced at the interface is reduced. Therefore, inserting a buffer layer between metal and MoS2 can be effective to mitigate FLP. Meanwhile, at the interface, atoms from metal electrode and sulfur (Scontact) on the surface of the MoS2 can form a bond. Therefore, the bond between the Scontact–Mo is weakened. Accordingly, Mo d states in the band edge become spread within the band gap to form a gap state, which also contributes to FLP. In this case, the gap state exists locally in Mo instead of Scontact, which cannot be explained by decaying wave function with the distance from the metal (MIGS). As a result, the pinning factor (S) was calculated as 0.71, which indicates a weak pinning. Here, S is defined by the first-order partial derivative of SBH with respect to ϕ, or the change of SBH \nwith ϕ. In the case of Al, because the d band exists deeper than the s and p bands, the direction of the induced dipole moment is different from that of other metals (Ag, Au, Pd, Ir, and Pt), which increases ϕ. In addition, if the d orbital is full (Ag, Al, and Au), the interaction with MoS2 is relatively small, and thus the shift in the EF of MoS2 with the metal contact is small. In the case of Pt, large ϕ (6.1 eV) lead to a p-type conduction in MoS2.\n5.3.2. Contact Engineering By Work Function Engineering Of Metals\nDas et al. reported that μFE is obtained differently depending on the type of metal when using Sc (ϕ = 3.5 eV), Ti (ϕ = 4.3 eV), Ni (ϕ = 5.0 eV), and Pt (ϕ = 5.9 eV) as electrodes of a ten-layer MoS2.\n Here, using Richardson equation, SBH (30 meV for Sc, ≈50 meV for Ti, ≈150 meV for Ni, and ≈230 meV for Pt) \nwas extracted from the Vds–Ids relationship with temperature. \nThis differs from the SBH estimated from the subtraction of ϕ to the χ of MoS2, which is attributed to FLP. At this point, S obtained was 0.1, which indicates that a strong pinning occurred. As a result, μFE was obtained as 184 cm2 V−1 s−1 for Sc, 125 cm2 V−1 s−1 for Ti, 90 cm2 V−1 s−1 for Ni, and 21 cm2 V−1 s−1 for Pt. That is, the value of μFE was higher when \n![18_image_0.png](18_image_0.png)\nChuang et al. reported that p-type conductivity can be achieved in MoS2 when using MoOx (x < 3) with a high ϕ\n(6.6 eV). Although MoOx has a high resistivity of ≈200 Ω µm, depositing a sufficiently thin MoOx layer of 50 nm or less results in the carrier transport without hindrance. Meanwhile, an XPS analysis of Pd (ϕ = 5.1 eV) and MoOx showed that the Pd has a sharp Fermi–Dirac step near the VB edge, whereas MoOx has relatively weak defect bands by weak O-vacancies near the VB edge. This means that MoOx not only has a low DOS near the EF but also has localized bonding states, which greatly reduces the formation of MIGS. Therefore, MoOx is less affected by the FLP and different to MoS2 contacted with high ϕ metal (e.g., Pd) showing an n-type conduction, MoS2 contacted with MoOx shows a p-type conduction.\nChuang et al. achieved a low Rc of ≈300 Ω µm by inserting a degenerate p-doped MoS2 (Mo0.095Nb0.005S2) layer between the metal electrode (Ti/Au) and WSe2.\n At this time, the doped layer was grown using the chemical vapor transport, and shows good environmental and thermal stability because Nb is connected by a covalent bond. Meanwhile, the difference in carrier density between the doped MoS2 and bare MoS2 establishes a band offset (Figure 7d). In traditional 3D semiconductors, the band offset is determined by a covalent bond between the two materials. In the case of junctions between 2D materials, weak interlayer binding energy makes the control over the energy band of bare MoS2 channel possible by applying gate bias without altering the energy level of doped MoS2 layer. That is, control of the band offset by tuning gate bias is possible. In this way, SBH for hole injection and the Rc was greatly reduced, and an ohmic contact with the μFE of 220 cm2 V−1 s−1 was achieved.\n5.3.3. Contact Engineering By Inserting Fermi Level Denning Layer\nKim et al. validated the Fermi level depinning (FLDP) effects in a more systematic way by introducing a buffer layer. TiO2 was used as a buffer layer, where TiO2 was deposited only in the source and drain area, excluding the effects of the interaction between the channel and the buffer layer. In addition, both source/drain and source/buffer/drain structures were implemented on the same exfoliated single crystal MoS2, eliminating the effects of changes in the characteristics of the channel materials. At this time, Ti, Cr, Au, and Pt electrodes were used, and devices with these metals showed n-type conductions. \nInterestingly, for Ti, there was little change in Ion owing to the insertion of 1 nm TiO2. However, Ion decreased by tenfold for Cu, 102-fold for Au, and 103-fold with Pt. Since Ion decreases as the ϕ of the metal increases, it can be inferred that the SBH \nfor electron notably increased with metal ϕ by the FLDP. Meanwhile, when fitted using thermionic emission model, S was found to be increased from 0.02 (metal/MoS2 structure) to 0.24 (metal/insulator/MoS2 structure) with a TiO2 layer insertion. For the thickness of the TiO2, the SBH tends to increase with the buffer layer thickness, which means an increased FLDP with the buffer layer thickness. Meanwhile, the FLDP can be induced by 1) MIGS reduction, 2) metal/semiconductor interface passivation, and 3) a dipole formation at the interface. To \n![19_image_1.png](19_image_1.png)\nevaluate this, the SBH of an electron was plotted as a function of metal ϕ. The SBH at the intersection between the real metal/\nMoS2 contact (S = 0.02) and an ideal metal/MoS2 contact (S = 1) \nwas calculated as 45 meV. For a perfect pinning (S = 0), the line also shares the same intersection point with S = 0.02 and S = 1. \nIn an ideal case, SBH is 0 for perfect pinning. Therefore, the discrepancy indicates that the pinning point within the multilayered MoS2 band gap, or ECNL, is located 45 meV below the CB edge. Based on these results, when S = 0.24 without influence from dipole (crossing the common intersection point) is compared with the experimental data for metal/TiO2/MoS2, the SBH reduction owing the formation of the dipole was estimated as 38 meV. Meanwhile, the deposition of TiO2 by sputtering makes the surface of MoS2 worse than that of the pristine MoS2, and thus the effect of interface passivation by TiO2 insertion is negligible. Therefore, the authors concluded that FLDP owing to an introduction of a buffer layer is mainly caused by a reduction of the MIGS, and the formation of dipoles makes a minor contribution.\n5.3.4. Achieving Van Der Waals Contact For Weak Fermi Level Pinning\nSince strong FLP in TMDCs occurs by the interactions between metals and TMDCs (e.g., formation of hybrid bonds), it is important to achieve vdW contact between metals and TMDCs that the SBH can be tuned as designed. Lie et al. reported that vdW contacts at the interface can be achieved by transferring metal electrodes onto the MoS2 (Figure 7e). In detail, a metal pattern was formed on a Si substrate and transferred to a multilayer MoS2(4–20 nm)/PMMA/SiO2/Si substrate using PDMS. After that, only PMMA on the contact pad was removed and the transport characteristics were measured. Analysis of the device by cross-sectional TEM shows that the MoS2/metal interface is atomically sharp when the metal electrodes were transferred by PDMS. Contrary to this, in the case of direct metallization by electron beam evaporator, defects, strain, disorder, and metal diffusion were observed at the interface. In terms of conductivity, devices with Ag (ϕ = 4.3 eV) electrode showed n-type, and devices with Cu (ϕ = 4.6 eV) showed a bipolar characteristics but more like an n-type with Ids three orders of magnitude smaller than the device with Ag electrode. This indicates that Cu has larger SBH for electron than Ag. \nDevices with Au (ϕ = 5.1 eV) and Pt (ϕ = 5.9 eV) electrodes exhibited a p-type conductivity due to the high ϕ, while the conductivities are n-type in the case of direct metallization due to FLP. Calculation of S value showed that the direct metallization has S value of 0.09, indicating strong FLP. On the other hand, when the metal electrode was transferred, S was obtained as 0.96, indicating almost no FLP is present. For the devices fabricated by metal electrode transfer method with PMMA/SiO2 as GI, μFE of MoS2 was obtained as 260 cm2 V−1 s−1 for electrons \n(Ag electrode) and 175 cm2 V−1 s−1 for holes (Pt electrode) at room temperature. For serial tunneling resistance established by vdW gap, the authors concluded that the contribution is negligible (theoretically estimated as 10−10–10−8 Ω cm2) due to very small gap (0.10–0.14 nm for theoretical predictions and 0.15 nm for experimental measurement). For reference, Rc in MoS2-based TFTs is in general 10−5–10−3 Ω cm2.\nSimilarly, Jung et al. used transferred via contact (TVC) \n![19_image_0.png](19_image_0.png)\nmethod to realize vdW contact between metal and TMDCs.\nDifferent to the previous report, metal electrode was dry transferred by h-BN, which has an advantage of preventing interfacial contamination by polymer residues. For carrying out TVC \nmethod, the environment was found to be very important. \nWhen the TVC is conducted within a glovebox, Pt/2L WSe2 device exhibited mainly a p-type conduction with Vth of ≈20 V, and a weak n-type conduction with Vth of ≈30 V. At 295 K, μFE\nfor hole was 195 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an RC was 3.5 kΩ µm. By contrast, when the TVC is performed in the air, Vth was negatively shifted (−10 V) for both p- and n-type conduction and Ion for the p-type conduction was significantly reduced. This indicates that contamination by water and hydrocarbons occurs when the device is exposed to air, which moves EF of the metal toward the mid-gap of the WSe2, increasing the SBH for a hole injection. \nIn addition, due to charge trapping at the interface, hysteresis is also observed.\nMeanwhile, Wang et al. showed that a vdW contact can be made by using a soft metal, which does not damage the surface of MoS2 during the deposition process. To demonstrate the concept, In (10 nm) was first deposited at 10−6 torr and then Au \n(100 nm) as a capping layer was deposited to prevent oxidation of In in the air. When the device with vdW contact was fabricated, RC was 3.3 kΩ µm at a single layer and 800 Ω µm at a multilayer MoS2. μFE was measured as 167 cm2 V−1 s−1 despite the use of SiO2 as GI and the channel remaining unencapsulated. At this time, the SBH was found to be 110 meV, which is the difference between ϕIn (4.1 eV) and χ of MoS2 (4.0 eV), \nwhich indicates that FLP does not occur at the interface. \nUnlike MoS2, WS2 and WSe2 have barriers to the electron or hole injection and thus have a high resistance because the CB \nor VB edge does not match well with ϕIn. For WSe2, the electronic injection barrier is 0.60 eV (RC = 16 kΩ µm) and the hole injection barrier is 0.73 eV (RC = 225 kΩ µm) when In/Au is used as an electrode. In this case, however, charge injection barrier can be controlled by deposition of alloys of In and other metals. Soft nature of In metal is suitable for the alloy formation. For example, when In (3 nm)/Pt (100 nm) was used as an electrode, the Kelvin force microscopy (KFM) measurement showed that ϕ of metal slightly increased from 4.05 (In) to 4.23 eV (In/Pt).\nKim et al. demonstrated a vdW contact by evaporating metal at a moderately low temperature, and at the same time, the substrate is cooled to 100 K using liquid nitrogen. When the interfaces of In or Au-deposited MoS2/SiO2/Si were analyzed by TEM, Au was found to invade MoS2 and make defects on the first and second layer of MoS2, while In make a clean interface without invasion. This is because In melts at ≈530 °C \nat the deposition pressure of 10−7 torr, whereas Au melts at \n≈860 °C that makes evaporating Au clusters more energetic. \nIn the case of the substrate temperature, the film was uniformly deposited at a low temperature (100 K), while granular film was deposited at room temperature. This suggests that lowering the energy of the metal cluster near the substrate is also important. Based on this, 6L MoS2 devices with In as source and drain electrodes, SiO2 as the GI, and h-BN as an encapsulation layer, showed μFE of 50 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an RC\nof 1 to 2 kΩ µm at room temperature. At this point, the RC\n![20_image_1.png](20_image_1.png)\ndecreased as the temperature decreases, implying ohmic contact is established.\n5.4. Effect Of Fabrication Processes On The Performance Of Tmdc Tfts 5.4.1. Effect Of Metal Deposition Pressures\nDifferent to the predictions, the real devices typically show μ below the expectations. When handled without care, there are possibilities that the samples are degraded in the ambient conditions. Also, there are some chances that the degradation occurs during the deposition process. McDonnell et al. confirmed that when depositing Ti on MoS2, different interfaces are formed depending on the deposition pressure. Here, the formation energies of the compounds possibly made during the deposition are −890 kJ mol−1 for TiO2, −226 kJ mol−1 for MoS2, and −574 to −390 kJ mol−1 for TiSx. Under a high vacuum (HV, ≈7.5 × 10−7 torr), Ti can be oxidized while it is deposited since O2 is sufficient. XPS analysis also confirmed the formation of TiO2. \nUnder ultra-high vacuum (UHV, ≈7.5 × 10−10 torr), TiO2 could not be formed owing to a low O2 concentration. Rather, TiSx is formed that is energetically more stable than MoS2. Also, Mo and MoxSy are formed as by-products. When the samples are passivated by 2 nm of Au during deposition, oxygen was not detected at samples with Ti deposited under UHV, while it was not at the samples with Ti deposited under HV. Therefore, TiO2 formed under HV originated from the deposition process, not from oxidation after deposition. At this time, due to the similar value for χ of TiO2 and ϕTi, the electrical characteristics are not significantly altered when TiO2 is deposited instead of Ti.\nMeanwhile, English et al. argued that there may be differences in the device performance depending on the deposition pressure of the metal electrode. When the morphology of metal is compared, UHV (10−9 torr) deposited Au showed sub-micrometer granules whereas HV (10−6 torr) deposited Au had nanocrystalline granules. Since the amount of adsorbed adsorbates at the metal-MoS2 interface at UHV is small, Au-MoS2 binding energy becomes smaller than cohesive energy of Au. This prefers to have a larger grain size for Au when deposited at UHV. \nAs a result, MoS2-Au interface can be smoother, which reduces RC and increases μ. In addition, the reduced amount of adsorbates at the interface also suppresses CI scattering, decreasing the RC and increasing μ. Consequently, the RC was reduced by approximately threefold by depositing Au under UHV rather than HV. Meanwhile, the effective barrier height extracted from the Richardson equation was not significantly different between UHV-Au and HV-Au, which implies that RC rather than the SBH \nhas a major effect on the device performance.\n5.4.2. Effect Of Process Residues\nAtomically thin TMDCs are vulnerable to any residues left during the device fabrication process. This is because the space that can accommodate changes by the residues (e.g., transferred charge) is relatively small. Liang et al. argued that PMMA as a typical photoresist cannot be completely removed even through vacuum annealing is carried out. The left PMMA \n![20_image_0.png](20_image_0.png) acts as a p-type dopant and induces a carrier density of 7.2 ×\n1011 cm−2.\n At this time, if the remaining PMMA is removed by scanning the surface of the TMDC in contact mode AFM, the surface roughness is reduced from 1.11 to 0.33 nm, and the maximum drain current increased by 136% on average and μFE\nincreased by 13%. Along with the photoresist, heterogeneous seed (e.g., PTAS) during the CVD process can also affect to μ. Utama et al. reported that PTAS acts as an impurity source and can worsen the electrical characteristics by increasing the roughness scattering. For two to five layered MoS2, μ of MoS2 grown without PTAS (≈1–10 cm2 V−1 s−1) was more than three orders of magnitude larger than MoS2 grown with PTAS \n(≈10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1).\n5.4.3. Effect Of Strain\nIf the growth of TMDC is assisted by the thermal energy, a strain is inevitably generated in the as-grown TMDC during substrate cooling owing to differences in the thermal expansion coefficients between the TMDC and substrate. Atomically thin TMDC is vulnerable to the change in its properties by the strain, which also affects to the electrical characteristics. Amani et al. compared the properties of as-grown CVDMoS2 and CVD-MoS2 transferred to a new substrate. When measuring the length of the edge directly by scanning electron microscopy, it was found that a 1.24% tensile strain is applied to the as-grown MoS2. This was similar to the value of the tensile strain of 1.37% calculated from the E2g1 and A1g peak shifts in the Raman spectra. Meanwhile, when the strain is released by transfer process, μ becomes 17.6 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is three times larger than the as-grown MoS2 (5.0 cm2 V−1 s−1).\n5.5. Reliability Of Tmdc Tfts 5.5.1. Hysteresis\nHysteresis in display TFT is important since the driving current in OLED can change significantly depending on the sweep direction and rate of gate bias. English et al. reported that the hysteresis can be reduced by evaporating adsorbates on the surface of the MoS2 channel by vacuum annealing (≈10−5 torr, 300 °C, 3 h) of devices within a probe station. At this time, Ids also increased. This was attributed to a Vth reduction, and not an RC reduction. Indeed, from the estimation of RC, the Au electrode did not made significant change in RC, while Ni electrode made an increase in RC by ≈25% as affected by oxygen during the annealing process.\nTongay et al. reported that the electronic concentration of MoS2 can be controlled by the adsorption of O2 and H2O from the air onto the surface of MoS2.\n Here, O2 and H2O withdraw electrons from MoS2, and thus electrostatic screening by electrons is weakened. As a result, the exciton becomes stabilized due to an increase in the exciton binding energy. Also, as the concentration of the electrons decreases, Auger recombination and non-radiative decay is reduced. This leads to an increase in the PL intensity by ten- or 35-fold (compared to the \nintensity measured at vacuum) when MoS2 is exposed to O2 or H2O. Meanwhile, when one O2 or H2O molecule is physiosorbed onto the surface of one unit cell of MoS2, the DFT calculation showed that 0.04 (equivalent to 5 × 1013 cm−2 in MoS2) \nand 0.01 electrons per unit cell are transferred to the adsorbates. At this time, the binding energy between the adsorbates and MoS2 is as weak as 70–140 meV (thermal energy at room temperature is 26 meV), then the adsorption at room temperature could be reversibly controlled through gas pressure control. On the other hand, chemisorption was found to be difficult to occur due to the high energy barrier of ≈2 eV. Meanwhile, the adsorbates can be anchored more strongly on the S vacancies, where the binding energy is estimated as 110 meV for O2 and 150 meV for H2O. At this time, the transferred charge to H2O increased by fivefold. However, such responses were not observed in inert gases, and a forming process was necessary to obtain sensitive responses. At this time, annealing is likely to remove contaminants or organic residues, to relieve stress built between the substrate and MoS2, or to form chalcogen vacancies. Similarly, Schmidt et al. reported that when backgated MoS2 device with its surface exposed to air was annealed at 200 °C for 2 h in a N2 atmosphere, there were no changes in the transfer curve. However, a subsequent annealing at 120 °C \nin vacuum for 4–10 h make a negative shift in a transfer curve owing to the desorption of O2 and H2O that make the device more n-type.\nYu et al. evaluated hysteresis behavior depending on the number of MoS2 layers (Figure 7f). Interestingly, bilayer MoS2 passivated by ALD-Al2O3 showed no hysteresis after passivation. It followed conventional carrier number fluctuation model in 1/f noise models. However, for multilayer, it exhibited large hysteresis even if it was passivated. From 1/f noise analysis, the authors found that the frequency behavior does not follow well-known 1/f noise models because of bulk traps inside the MoS2. From SIMS profiling, they found that oxygen species exists in the exfoliated MoS2 and suggested that such oxygen species contribute as bulk trap sites.\n5.5.2. Environmental Stability\nIn general, TMDC shows a deterioration of the surface even when exposed to air for a short period of time. Gao et al. measured the properties of CVD-WS2 after it is stored in ambient conditions for a year. As a result, most areas of the WS2 disappeared in the optical image, and the PL intensity was reduced by up to sixfold. In addition, even when CVD-WS2 was stored at ≈1 torr for 1 month, two orders of magnitude reduction in the drain current is observed. From XPS analysis, W:S = 1:1.33 was measured. Also, as the sample is aged, S \nlosses become notable and the amount of W-O bond increased. Meanwhile, from the Auger electron spectroscopy element mapping, oxygen was found to be rich at the grain boundaries and edges. From the fact that single crystal mechanically exfoliated samples showed low degradation rate over time, the authors suggested that oxidation through aging occur in the following sequence: 1) initiation of oxidation at the crystal edge, grain boundary, and defects (e.g., vacancy). 2) Propagation of oxidation to the grain interiors. Such degradations can be suppressed by coating the barrier layers with a low water \n![21_image_0.png](21_image_0.png)\nand O2 permeability, such as with perylene C and PMMA. \nMeanwhile, control over the growth conditions and growth geometry may also suppress a degradation of the synthesized sample (e.g., CVD-grown sample). For example, MoS2 grown at a low vapor concentration did not show any apparent changes in the properties during the aging owing to its small S vacancy concentration.\n5.6. Oled Applications Of Tmdc Tfts\nRecently, efforts on driving pixels in displays based on TMDC TFTs were made by several groups. Atomically thin nature of TMDCs are advantageous in realizing deformable, flexible, foldable, rollable displays and soft electronics requiring both a mechanical robustness and a high electrical performance. \nFigure 8a shows a pixel driving circuit using mechanically exfoliated WSe2 as a channel material for switching and driving TFTs. With the traditional 2T driving circuit, on and off of OLED pixels and adjusting grayscale luminance is possible. Here, a switching signal from the switching TFT (left-side TFT in Figure 8a) controls the on/off operation of the pixel driving circuit, and the data signal from the switching TFT controls the grayscale of the OLED while the switching signal is in an on-state. According to this operating mechanism of a 2T driving circuit, OLED pixels show only an on-state when the gate voltage swing (VSW) and the data voltage (VDATA) are simultaneously applied at 2–3 and 6–7 s (Figure 8b). Since an OLED is based on a current driving scheme, precise control over the OLED driving current (IOLED) is very important. \nHere, IOLED could be adjusted by changing VDATA. When VDATA\nwas increased from −5 to −3 V, IOLED decreases from 8.46 to 0.62 µA, and the luminance of the OLED also decreased \nLater on, Woo et al. fabricated a 2T driving circuit for an OLED operation on a flexible plastic substrate using CVDgrown bi/trilayer MoS2 as a channel material (Figure 8d).\nWhen tested under a 2T driving scheme, both high uniformity in electrical characteristics over large area and a sufficient performance of the switching and driving TFTs were confirmed. \nIn terms of electrical properties, Ion over 100 µA, Ion/Ioff of \n≈109, and μFE of ≈9 cm2 V−1 s−1 were obtained. For a bending test with a bending radius (R) from infinite (flat state) to a 4 mm, the TFT showed a stable current density and Ion/Ioff, as shown in Figure 8e. Figure 8f shows that as VDATA decreased from 8 to 1 V, output current (IOUTPUT) also decreased accordingly, indicating that the grayscale control is possible with high reliability even under R = 3.5 mm. This corresponds to a strong tensile strain of 1.82%, indicating a nearly critical point of an Al2O3 breakdown. That is, for the displays based on TMDCs, an inorganic GI can be a limiting factor in achieving high flexibility.\nSimilarly, Choi et al. demonstrated an AM-OLED driven by bilayer MoS2 TFTs on a flexible polymer substrate \n(Figure 8g). Here, MOCVD at a moderately low pressure \n(7.5 torr) enabled a centimeter-scale growth of MoS2. The MoS2 film had a high uniformity in electrical properties (over 500 TFTs) with an average μ of 18.1 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is sufficient \n![22_image_0.png](22_image_0.png)\nto drive AM-OLED. However, a simple 1T-1OLED scheme is used, and thus IOLED must be controlled by the gate bias under a constant data bias (Figure 8h). Finally, by controlling gate bias and data bias in real time, displaying letters of M-O-S-2 in a sequence was demonstrated (Figure 8i). Not only the display was working on a human wrist, but also its variation in Ion/Ioff was very small (± 2%) without the external compensation circuits. Also, a small variation in IOLED at R = 0.7 mm was shown, implying TMDCs have great potentials in realizing future displays with various form factors requiring an extreme flexibility.\n6. Conclusion\nDisplays have evolved in such a way that they provide users more conveniences as an interactive platform of communications among people, by delivering visual information in the form of light. In early days, displays were bulky, energy-inefficient, and had low resolutions. However, the development of TFT technologies resulted in a breakthrough, realizing slim, lightweight, and high-resolution flat panel displays. Along with the development of new display types such as LCD and OLED, transitions in form factors have realized small-sized mobile \ndisplays such as those in smart phones and smart watches, which have become an important interface in Internet of Things (IoTs) and have changed our lifestyles.\nThe technological transitions were made possible by the invention and development of materials and their associated device technologies. For example, the establishment of excimer laser technology was the first step toward the discovery of high μ LTPS. This resulted in the widespread use of OLED, which has shown the possibilities of transforming displays into any shape. On the other hand, simulations or design-driven approaches have enabled the commercialization of large-area displays with AOSs. Similarly, the discovery of new channel materials will make it possible to realize next-generation displays such as tomographic image-synthesized layered 3D display, which requires materials with exceptionally high performances. TMDC is one of the strong candidates of such new materials since it possesses exotic properties originating from the 2D electron gas system.\nFor the realization of new materials, not only the material property itself but the related processes should be precisely designed. For example, LTPS technology can be adopted to improve crystallinity of new channel materials by utilizing light– material interactions, which have shown significant potential for realizing high-performance 2D materials via their exceptional capability to induce multi-physical, transient, and non-equilibrium photon reactions. Similarly, as recently reported by Im et al., spot-beam laser-crystallization methods, which can mitigate the line-beam associated non-uniformity issues and reduce the cost of laser, can be applied in industrial scales. Likewise, the commercialization of new materials can be achieved by utilizing the existing technologies to exploit maximum material properties. Such developments in materials preparation and processing systems along with the related software and artificial intelligence \n(AI) technologies in the display itself would enable us to make a further leap toward a new era in the display industry.\nThis work was supported by Creative Materials Discovery Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by Ministry of Science and ICT (NRF-2016M3D1A1900035) and LG Display Co., Ltd.\nConflict Of Interest\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\ncontact resistance, device structures, display technologies, thin film transistors, transition metal dichalcogenides Received: October 31, 2019 Revised: December 16, 2019 Published online: \n a) F.

However, poor selectivity and the reduced immunity of a-IGZO with respect to data lines (Al, Cu)\nusing a wet etchant (PAN) have still limited their facile implementation into mobile products , . With regard to performance, it is imperative to secure a high mobility, which is in ever-increasing demand, to realize an ultrahigh resolution and high frame rate driving. In this regard, indium gallium zinc tin oxide (IGZTO) has been an interesting composition system, because: 1) it has a high carrier mobility (>30 cm2/Vs) and 2) its improved chemical selectivity and immunity against wet etching using PAN can improve its production capacity and quality, stemming from the chemically robust nature of SnO2.\nAlthough the feasibility of high mobility and reasonably stable IGZTO TFTs has been reported –, little is known with regard to the physical origin of their superior performance.\nIn this article, we compared the performance and electrical stability of IGZO and IGZTO TFTs prepared via sputtering. The transistor with an IGZTO channel exhibited a superior field-effect mobility (μFE) of 46.7 cm2/Vs and a low gate swing [subthreshold swing (SS)] of 0.15 V/decade compared with those (20.3 cm2/Vs and 0.18 V/decade) with an IGZO\nchannel. Furthermore, the gate-bias stress stability for the IGZTO TFTs was found to be better than that for the IGZO TFTs. The physical rationale for these intriguing results could be attributed to enhanced percolation path formation and efficient mass densification due to Sn loading into the IGZO\nIi. Experimental Procedure\nThe bottom gate a-IGZO and IGZTO TFTs were fabricated onto heavily doped p-type silicon substrates with a 100-nmthick thermal SiO2 film as a gate electrode. The 20-nmthick IGZO and IGZTO films were deposited as a channel layer onto the SiO2/Si substrates using a magnetron sputtering system at room temperature. The 3-in-diameter ceramic IGZO and IGZTO targets were used. The power, working pressure, and O2/(Ar + O2) ratio were 100 W, 3 mTorr, and 10%,\nrespectively. The gas flow rate for Ar and O2 was fixed at 18 and 2 sccm, respectively, corresponding to an oxygen 0018-9383 © 2020 IEEE. Personal use is permitted, but republication/redistribution requires IEEE permission.\npartial pressure of 10%. Tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) was deposited as a film for the source/drain electrodes using the same sputtering system. The dc power and working pressure were 50 W and 5 mTorr under an Ar atmosphere (flow rate of 20 sccm), respectively. The channel width ( W ) and length ( L ) of the channel region were 1000 and 300 µ m, respectively. The channel and source/drain electrodes were patterned through a shadow mask during deposition. The fabricated TFTs were subjected to thermal annealing at 300 or 400 °C for 1 h under an air ambient furnace. The electrical properties of the TFTs were characterized at room temperature under dark ambient conditions using a Keithley 2636 semiconductor analyzer system. The surface morphology of the IGZO and IGZTO films was analyzed via atomic force microscopy (AFM, XE-100, Psia). The chemical states of the IGZO and IGZTO films were characterized via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, THETA PROBE, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The structural properties and mass density of the IGZO and IGZTO thin films were analyzed via high-resolution X-ray reflectivity measurements (XRR,\nPANalytical, X'pert Pro). The XRR data were fit using the Philips Wingixa software package. The electronic structure, which included features of the conduction band (CB), was analyzed using the X-ray absorption spectra (XAS). XAS was measured using a coherent X-ray beam source at the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL) on beamline 10D.\nIi. Results And Discussion\nFig. 1 shows the representative transfer characteristics of the fabricated TFTs with a -IGZO and IGZTO channel layers. The field-effect mobility ( μ FE ) was calculated from either the maximum transconductance ( μ FE , lin = Lg m /(WC OX V DS ) at VDS = 0.1 V, where gm is the transconductance and COX\nis the oxide capacitance of the gate insulator per unit area)\nor the incremental slope ( μ FE ,sat) of V GS versus IDS\nplot in the saturation region.

The SS\n(SS = dVDs/dlog/Ds [V/decade]) was extracted from the linear segment of the plot for log( IDS ) versus VGS . The device with a conventional a -IGZO channel annealed at 300 °C exhibited a //FE,lin value of 16.2 cm 2 /Vs, VTH of 6.1 V, SS of 0.49 V/decade, and an I ON /OFF ratio of ~10 8 [see Fig. 1(a)] . The a -IGZO TFTs annealed at T A = 400 °C\nexhibited an improved µ FE , lin value of 20.3 cm 2 /Vs, V TH of 1.4 V, SS of 0.18 V/decade, and an ION/OFF ratio of > 108\n[see Fig. 1(b) ], which was comparable with the state-of-theart characteristics of a -IGZO TFTs that were implemented in AMOLED television products . By contrast, a substantial improvement ( ∼ 33.9 cm 2 /Vs) in terms of µ FE , lin was clearly observed for the TFT with an IGZTO channel even at a lower TA of 300 °C, as shown in Fig. 1(c) . The highest µ FE,lin value (~46.7 cm 2 /Vs) was achieved for devices with IGZTO\nchannels at T A = 400 °C. The µ FE,sat value, which usually has the maximum peak value under the saturation condition\n( V GS –V TH < V DS ), was also compared in Table I . The overall trend for the different devices was consistent with the variation of µ FE ,lin value although the saturation mobility for the given device is smaller than the linear mobility. Generally, the µ FE value in multicomponent oxide semiconductor systems can be affected by the cation composition, film roughness, film density, and defect density of the channel layer. The cation composition of In:Ga:Zn for the IGZO channel layer was found to be 31:56:13. Thus, the fraction of [In]/([In] + [Ga] + [Zn])\nwas 31 at. %. On the other hand, the fraction of mobility enhancers certainly increased for the IGZTO transistors where the ratio of In:Ga:Zn:Sn for the channel layer was determined to be 51:24:21:4. Among different cations, the 5s orbital intercalation of the In 3+ cation with the largest ion radius provided an effective percolation pathway near the CB edge, which was known to be a mobility enhancer. Considering an identical electron configuration and the similar ion radius of In 3+ and Sn 4+ , the larger fraction ( ∼ 55%) of [In] and [Sn]\nwas responsible for a significant mobility improvement\n(~46.7 cm 2 /Vs) for the resulting IGZTO transistors. It should be noted that the SS factor for the IGZTO TFTs was smaller than that for the IGZO TFTs at a given T A = 300 and 400 °C,\nas summarized in Table I . From the SS values, the number of fast bulk traps (NSS) and semiconductor–insulator interfacial traps (Dit) was calculated using the following equation :\n$$\\mathrm{SS}={\\frac{q k_{\\mathrm{B}}T(N_{\\mathrm{SS}}t_{\\mathrm{ch}}+D_{\\mathrm{it}})}{C_{i}\\log(e)}}$$\nwhere q is the electron charge, kB is Boltzmann's constant, T is the absolute temperature, and tch is the channel layer thickness. NSS and Dit in the IGZO or IGZTO TFTs were calculated by setting one of the parameters to zero. Therefore, the NSS and Dit values were considered to be the maximum trap densities formed within a given system. The NSS value\n(7.8 × 1017 cm−3eV−1) for IGZO at TA = 300 ◦C was rather high, suggesting that a reduction in the tail state distribution was not effective under a relatively lower annealing temperature. Thermal annealing at 400 ◦C resulted in a greater threefold reduction (2.2 × 1017 cm−3eV−1) in the NSS value for the IGZO transistor. Interestingly, the IGZTO device at TA =\n300 ◦C exhibited a smaller NSS value (1.8×1017 cm−3eV−1)\nthan that of the IGZO device at TA = 400 ◦C. This meant that the high loading of In and Sn cations allowed the unwanted gap states to be easily eliminated during thermal annealing.\nTo gain insight with regard to the superior performance of IGZTO TFTs compared with IGZO TFTs, the structural and chemical states of the IGZO and IGZTO films were examined via AFM, XRD, XRR, and XPS. Fig. 2 shows the AFM morphologies for the IGZO and IGZTO films annealed at TA = 300 and 400 ◦C. A featureless smooth topography was observed for all the IGZO and IGZTO films. The rootmean-square (Rrms) value for the IGZO films at TA = 300 and 400 ◦C was 1.5 and 1.2 nm over a scan area of 2×2 μm2. The Rrms values for the IGZTO films at TA = 300 and 400 ◦C were slightly reduced to 1.1 and 1.0 nm at TA = 300 and 400 ◦C,\nrespectively. Fig. 3 shows the XRD patterns for the IGZO and IGZTO films on SiO2/Si substrates. Both oxide films featured no discernible peaks irrespective of TA, indicating a typical amorphous phase.\nThe mass density of the IGZO and IGZTO films was evaluated via an XRR analysis . Fig. 4 shows the XRR\ndata for the IGZO and IGZTO films on SiO2/Si substrates annealed at TA = 300 and 400 ◦C. Critical angles for the total reflection for the IGZTO films, which is proportional to the electron density for the given film, were larger than those for the IGZO films irrespective of TA, indicating that the IGZTO film was denser at a given TA. The critical angle values for the IGZO films at TA = 300 and 400 ◦C were 0.697 and 0.706◦, respectively, whereas those values (0.721◦\nand 0.730◦) were increased for the IGZTO films at TA = 300 and 400 ◦C. Thus, the highest mass density of 6.58 g/cm3 was obtained from the IGZTO film at TA = 400 ◦C, whereas the IGZO film at TA = 300 ◦C exhibited the lowest mass density of 6.02 g/cm3 (see Table II). The XRR-derived Rrms values for the IGZTO films at TA = 300 and 400 ◦C were 0.47 and 0.52 nm, respectively, which were smaller than those (0.70 and 0.68 nm) for the IGZO films at TA = 300 and 400 ◦C. The reason for the roughness difference between AFM and XRR was due to the macroscopic volume analysis of the XRR probes, whereas the AFM scan area was quite small (∼2-μm scale). Thus, the XRR-derived roughness COMPARISON OF R rms AND M ASS D ENSITY V ALUES FOR THE IGZO\nAND IGZTO F ILMS A NNEALED AT T A = 300 AND 400 °C\n| AFM R OO      | XRR Rem   |      |      |\n|---------------|-----------|------|------|\n| ID            | density   |      |      |\n| (g/cm 2 )     |           |      |      |\n| IGZO/400 °C   | 1.2       | 0.68 | 6.08 |\n| IGZTO/300 1 C | 1.0       | 0.47 | 6.43 |\n| IGZTO/400 °C  |           |      |      |\ndata were more reliable. It is well accepted that the mass density of the channel layer is a key factor in determining the electrical performance and stability of the resulting oxide transistors . It should be noted that the mass density of the film depended on the ingredient of cations and film densification properties during thermal annealing. In this article, we roughly estimated the mass density of the given crystal IGZO or IGZTO films using the following equation:\nΡ = ( Σ X I M I )/[ Σ X I ( M I / Ρ I )]\nwhere x i (i = 1, 2, 3, and 4) is the molar fraction of In 2 O 3 ,  Ga 2 O 3 ,  ZnO,  and  SnO 2 ,  respectively; M i  is  a  corresponding molecular weight; and ρ i ( i = 1, 2, 3, and 4)\nis the mass density of crystal In 2 O 3 (7.18 g/cm 3 ), Ga 2 O 3 (6.44 g/cm 3 ), ZnO (5.61 g/cm 3 ), and SnO 2 (6.85 g/cm 3 ),\nrespectively –. The theoretical maximum density for In0.31Ga0.56Zn0.13O1.435 and In0.51Ga0.24Zn0.21Sn0.04O1.415 was estimated to be 6.63 and 6.74 g/cm 3 , respectively. Therefore, the degree of composition-normalized densification for the IGZO and IGZTO films at 400 °C was estimated to be 91.7% and 97.6%, respectively. The shallow Gaussian trap states and tail states below the CB edge could be attributed to oxygen vacancies (more accurately under-coordinated indium)\nwith a large void volume and In cation disordering, respectively . The high mass density of the given IGZO film suggested that these adverse trap and tail states were effectively reduced during thermal annealing. Although there was no explicit calculation for the IGZTO system, it was quite reasonable that similar gap states, such as Gaussian trap and tail states, existed in the IGZTO substance. Thus, superior mobility and reduced gap states for the IGZTO transistors should result from the effective mass densification of the IGZTO channel layer during thermal annealing compared with that of IGZO films.\nThe chemical states of the IGZO and IGZTO films were analyzed via XP spectra. Fig. 5(a) and (b) shows the XP spectra for the O1s peak of a -IGZO thin films at T A = 300 and 400 °C, respectively. The C 1s peak for C–C bonds was assigned to 284.5 eV to calibrate the photoelectron binding. The O 1s peak was deconvoluted into three sub peaks at 530.2, 530.9, and 531.9 eV , . The O 1s peaks centered at 530.2 and 530.9 eV were assigned to the full coordination of oxygen to metal ions and to under-coordinated metal ions. Although the latter peak was associated with oxygen vacancies ( V O ), these vacancies could not be strictly defined in amorphous materials due to a lack of long-range order.\nHowever, for convenience, oxygen associated with undercoordinated metal ions was referred to as Vo-related O 1s\n| O 1s peak [ eV ]   |                  |              |      |\n|--------------------|------------------|--------------|------|\n| ID                 | Oxygen deficient | .attice oxyg |      |\n| 531.9 ± 0.10       | 530.9 ± 0.10 )   | 530.2 ± 0.10 |      |\n| IGZO               | 5.8              | 28.9         | 63.5 |\n| 1/300°C            |                  |              |      |\n| IGZO               | 4.1              | 22.1         | 73.5 |\n| 4000               |                  |              |      |\n| IGZTO              | 4.3              | 18.7         | 7.0  |\n| 1/300°C            |                  |              |      |\n| IGZTO              | 3.7              | 9.5          | 86.9 |\n| 400°C              |                  |              |      |\neven within the amorphous phase of the IGZO film. The peak at 531.9 eV was attributed to impurity-related oxygen, such as hydroxyl groups. As the annealing temperatures increased from 300 to 400 °C, the metal-oxygen lattice peak and Vo-related peak increased and decreased, respectively, without a significant change in the impurity-related peak (see Table III ). This indicated that high-temperature annealing facilitated the conversion of Vo defects into metal-lattice oxygen, which was corroborated by an improvement in the performance of the resulting IGZO transistors. Similar thermal annealing trends were observed for the IGZTO films. However, it must be emphasized that the relative area ( ∼ 9.5% and 3.7%) of the Vo and impurity-related peaks for the IGZTO\nfilms annealed at T A = 400 °C were the smallest compared with those ( ∼ 22.1% and 4.1%) of IGZO fi lms annealed at T A = 400 °C. These results could be attributed to the effective mass densification of IGZTO films during thermal annealing compared with that of IGZO films. The exact mechanism is not clear at the present. However, the loading of additional Sn ions or a large fraction of In ions into the IGZTO films may be helpful toward the effective rearrangement of cations or adjusting the stoichiometric cation-to-anion ratio, leading to a reduction in adverse gap states and mass densification.\nThe VB offset (EVB) between the Fermi level (EF) and VB maximum (EVB) for the IGZO and IGZTO thin films decreased slightly from 3.18 and 3.22 eV to 3.09 and 3.13 eV,\nrespectively, when TA increased from 300 to 400 ◦C. The corresponding extracted band gap values for the IGZO and IGZTO films decreased from 3.57 and 3.25 eV to 3.46 and 3.12 eV, respectively, with an increase in TA from 300 to 400 ◦C. Considering the band gap (by spectroscopic ellipsometry) and VB offset (by XPS), a schematic energy diagram was obtained, as shown in Fig. 6(c). With regard to IGZO\nfilms, the CB offsets (ECB) between the CB minimum\n(ECB) and EF for the films at TA = 300 and 400 ◦C\nwere 0.39 and 0.37 eV, respectively. By contrast, the ECB\nvalues for IGZTO films at TA = 300 and 400 ◦C were reduced to 0.03 and −0.01 eV, respectively. This indicated that the IGZTO films exhibit facile percolation conduction, whereas the transition from localized trap-mediated transport to percolation was dominant in the IGZO films. Obviously, a drastic decrease in the CB offset was related to an increase in the free electron density (n) by the following equation:\nn = NC exp[−(ECB–EF)/kBT ], where NC is the effective density of states near ECB, kB is the Boltzmann's constant, and T is the absolute temperature. This result correlated with the superior mobility and more negative VTH values for the IGZTO transistors compared with those for IGZO transistors.\nThe experimentally measured O K1 edge XAS spectra of\nbinary In2O3, ZnO, Ga2O3, and SnO2 were coplotted to identify their responsible contribution within the IGZO and IGZTO films. Major features \"A\" and \"B\" in the IGZO film spectra could be attributed to In 5sp/Ga 4s/O 2p and In 5s/Zn 4sp/O 2p, respectively . The lowest energy CB state of the \"A\" feature was known to possess a large degree of s-orbital character rather than p-character, which was primarily responsible for electrical conduction through the empty states. The number of lowest energy CB states for the IGZO films was relatively independent in terms of thermal annealing [see Fig. 7(a)]. Interestingly, thermal annealing of the IGZTO film increased the relative intensity of feature \"A,\" suggesting that the heavy loading of In and Sn could enhance the effective number of unoccupied orbital states. Additionally, the photon energy for feature \"A\" was slightly reduced, which correlated with the lower O K1 edge of SnO2 compared with In2O3.\nFinally, the bias-thermal-stress instabilities of the IGZO\nand IGZTO TFTs were compared. Fig. 8(a) and (b) shows variations in VTH (VTH) for the IGZO and IGZTO TFTs at TA = 400 ◦C, respectively, under positive bias stress (PBS)\nconditions as a function of the stress time. In this test, the devices were stressed under gate biases of +20 V (for PBS) and −20 V (for negative bias stress (NBS)) at room temperature for 3600 s. The devices with IGZO channels suffered huge positive (VTH = +7.7 V) shifts during PBS\ntesting, as shown in Fig. 8(a). By contrast, the IGZTO TFTs exhibited stable behavior against PBS duration: the VTH\nvalue was reduced to +0.5 V. It was also shown that the negative shift of VTH for the IGZO and IGZTO TFTs was comparable (VTH = −0.4 V) under NBS testing. The superior PBS stability of the IGZTO TFT was maintained at the ac condition, as shown in Fig. 9. The VTH values for the IGZO and IGZTO TFTs at TA = 400 ◦C during ac PBS duration were 1.47 and 0.08 V, respectively, which were substantially smaller than those under dc PBS duration.\nThe reason for the smaller VTH values under ac condition compared with dc condition for both devices can be attributed to the detrapping process during recovery phase of ac bias stress . In addition, the equivalent dc stress time for ac stress test is approximately half of that for dc stress test, because the duty ratio of ac test is 50%. Thus, the effective\nreduced stress time (total summation time of high-level stress)\ncan also result in the smaller AVTH values. Generally, the bias instability of the IGZO TFTs was known to deteriorate with an increasing In fraction in the IGZO channel due to the facile creation of oxygen vacancy defects. The superior bias stability in the IGZTO TFTs was unexpected due to the heavy loading (~56%) of In and Sn in the IGZTO system. PBS\ninstability could be explained on the basis of the carrier trapping mechanism. The amount of charges trapped into the channel bulk and channel/insulator interface would be proportional to the number of trap states near the quasi-Fermi\nenergy level. The interfacial states or channel bulk trap sites provide possible trapping sites only if they are empty states.\nThe deep states filled with electron cannot capture the mobile electron carrier. Thus, the tail state distribution below E C\nwas largely responsible for the PBS instability of the given device. As mentioned earlier, the IGZTO device at T A = 400 °C exhibited a smaller NSS value (1.6 x 10 17 cm − 3 eV − 1 )\nthan that (2.2 × 10 17 cm − 3 eV − 1 ) for the IGZO device at an identical T A . Therefore, the superior PBS stability of the IGZTO device should be attributed to a lower tail distribution. In amorphous semiconductors, tail states and deep states can be attributed to the disorder of constituent atoms and undercoordinated configurations, respectively. This suggested that the simultaneous loading of In an Sn helped atomic relaxation during thermal annealing as discussed in the XRP data. The interpretation was consistent with the fact that IGZTO featured a high degree of mass densification ( ∼ 97.6%) compared with\n(91.7%) IGZO films. Indeed, the portion of oxygen deficiency (~9.5%) in IGZTO films at T A = 400 °C was smaller than that ( ∼ 22%) for IGZO fi lms in the XPS analysis.\nIt should be noted that the negative V TH value of IGZTO\nTFTs at T A = 400 °C may not be desirable in terms of the standby drain leakage current, which was mainly caused by the increase in n . The reason for the increase in n of IGZTO\nfilm at T A = 400 °C compared with that at T A = 300 °C\nis rather ambiguous. The electrical role of Vo should be carefully considered, because Vo with under-coordinated and fully coordinated cation act as trap state and a shallow donor, respectively , . The ratio of shallow Vo centers over trap-like Vo defects can be a meaningful parameter. It was suggested that the higher mass density for the given cationcomposition channel favor the shallow Vo center rather than trap-like Vo defects. Thus, the denser network of IGZTO film at T A = 400 °C compared to that at T A = 300 °C could result in the increase of n value and negative displacement of V TH\nvalue, because the ratio of shallow Vo centers over trap-like VO defects can be significantly increased (i.e., mitigation of carrier compensation effect) despite overall Vo-related peak reduction. The oxygen doping during the IGZTO preparation turned out to be effective to shift the VTH value to the positive VGS direction. Fig. 10 shows the transfer characteristics of the IGZTO TFTs at TA = 400 °C where the channel layer was deposited at the higher oxygen ratio of Ar:O2 = 16:4 sccm; its μFE, SS, and VTH values were 40.4 cm2/Vs, 0.11 V/decade, and 0.0 V, respectively.\nIn summary, the electrical performance and stability of the a-IGZO and IGZTO TFTs were examined. The μFE value\n(46.7 cm2/Vs) and SS factor (0.15 V/decade) for the IGZTO\ntransistors was improved substantially compared with that\n(20.3 cm2/Vs and 0.18 V/decade) for IGZO transistors at TA = 400 ◦C. Obviously, the superior performance of IGZTO\ntransistors should be attributed to the increased fractions\n(∼55%) of In and Sn, which provided an easy percolation path and lower effective mass. This was supported by a drastic decrease in CB offset and an enhanced number of empty orbital states from the energy band and XAS analysis.\nInterestingly, the IGZTO TFTs exhibited an improved gatebias stability compared with the IGZTO TFTs, which could not be explained by the conventional composition dependence. The XRR and XPS analyses indicated that the IGZTO films at TA = 400 ◦C featured a high degree (97%) of mass densification and lower VO defect density (9.5%) compared with the IGZO films (91.7% and 22.1%, respectively), which resulted in a lower tail state distribution below EC and superior PBS stability. Therefore, the quaternary IGZTO system could be used as an alternative backplane device for advanced mobile active-matrix displays."

        "text": "Achieving High Field-Effect Mobility Exceeding 50 Cm2/Vs In In-Zn-Sn-O Thin-Film Transistors\nJi Hun Song, Kwang Suk Kim, Yeon Gon Mo, Rino Choi, and Jae Kyeong Jeong Abstract**— Bottom gate and etch stopper-type thin-film transistors (TFTs) with a channel layer of indium–zinc–tin oxide were**\nfabricated. The resulting TFTs exhibited a high mobility exceeding 52 cm2/V s, a low subthreshold gate swing of 0.2 V/decade, a threshold voltage of 0.1 V, and an ION/OFF ratio of >2 × 108.\nThe stability of the oxide passivated device under the positive and negative bias stress conditions was superior to that of the nitride passivated device, which can be attributed to the lower trap density in the channel layer.\nIndex Terms**— Indium zinc tin oxide semiconductor, high**\nmobility, passivation, nitride film, hydrogen, thin-film transistors.\nRECENT interest in the transition metal oxide thin film transistors (TFTs) for information display has led to a demand for various multi-component materials, composed primarily of heavy cations with *(n-1)d*10ns0 orbitals because they offer several intriguing properties, such as low temperature processing, high mobility (>10 cm2/Vs), excellent uniformity, and good transparency to visible light , . These properties indicate that metal oxide TFTs are suitable replacements for amorphous and polycrystalline Si TFTs in active matrix (AM) displays, such as liquid crystal display and organic light emitting diodes. On the other hand, the next generation AM display requires a larger size (>60 inch), high resolution (>200 pixels per inch), and high frame rate\nK. S. Kim and Y. G. Mo are with the Research and Development Center, Samsung Display, Yongin 446-711, Korea.\nDigital Object Identifier 10.1109/LED.2014.2329892 channel layer –. Therefore, it is still imperative to search for metal oxide TFTs with both high mobility (>40 cm2/Vs)\nand low off-state current (<10−12 A).\nIn this study, indium zinc tin oxide (IZTO) was used as a channel layer and the resulting IZTO TFTs exhibited promising performance: the field-effect mobility and off-state current\n(*IOFF* ) were 52.4 cm2/Vs and 2 × 10−13 A, respectively. The mobility of ∼ 52.4 cm2/Vs achieved in this study is the highest of any patterned metal oxide TFTs without compromising the other device parameters, such as *IOFF* . Moreover, IZTO TFTs with the bilayer passivation architecture of SiO2/SiO2 also showed better positive and negative gate bias stress stability than with the passivation architecture of SiNx/SiO2.\nIi. Experimental Procedure\nThe lithographically pattern Mo metal film on a SiO2/glass substrate was used as the gate electrode. A SiO2 (200nm)\nfilm as a gate dielectric layer was prepared by PECVD at 380°C. The 50-nm-thick IZTO film was deposited on a SiO2/Mo/SiO2/glass substrate by magnetron sputtering. The atomic ratio of the IZTO film was In: Zn: Sn = 40: 36: 24.\nAfter defining the IZTO channel using conventional lithography and etching, a 200-nm-thick SiO2 film was deposited and patterned as a etch stop layer (ESL). The SiO2 film was formed by PECVD at a power of 500 W, chamber pressure of 2.5 Torr, and chamber temperature of 300 °C. The gas flow rate of SiH4 and N2O were 50 and 9,000 sccm, respectively.\nThe Mo source/drain electrode was formed by sputtering and patterned by dry etching. Finally, the IZTO devices were passivated using either 100-nm-thick SiO2 or SiNx film. In the case of PECVD-derived SiO2 (SiNx) passivation, the chamber power, pressure and temperature were 700 (590) W, 250 (300) °C and 3.0 (1.5) Torr, respectively. The gas flow rates of SiH4 and N2O during deposition of SiO2 passivation layer were 150 and 4,000 sccm, respectively while those of SiH4 and N2 for SiNx passivation were 130 and 1,350 sccm, respectively. After preparing the IZTO device, the samples were annealed thermally at 300 °C for 1 hr. The transfer characteristics of the IZO TFTs with W/L = 270/15 µm were measured at room temperature using a Keithley 2636 source meter.\nIii. Results And Discussion\n(µFE ) value was calculated from either the maximum transconductance (µFE,lin = Lgm/WCiVDS, where Ci and gm are 0741-3106 © 2014 IEEE. Personal use is permitted, but republication/redistribution requires IEEE permission.\nthe gate capacitance per unit area and the trans-conductance, respectively) or the incremental slope (µFE,sat) of VGS vs I\n1/2 DS\nplot in the saturation region. The threshold voltage (VTH)\nwas determined by adjusting the gate voltage, which induces a drain current of L/W × 10nA at a VDS of 5.1V. The sub-threshold gate swing (SS = dVGS/dlogIDS[V/decade])\nwas extracted from the linear part of the log(IDS) vs. VGS plot. The interfacial (Nit) and bulk trap (Nss) density were calculated from the SS values. The oxide-passivated device exhibited remarkable performance: the µFE,lin , µFE,sat , SS, VTH\nand ION/OFF ratio were 48.0±3.5, 41.0±2.5 cm2/Vs, 0.14 ±\n0.03 V/decade, −0.5 ± 0.2 V, and >2 × 109, respectively, as shown in Fig. 1(a) and (c). Promising performance was also observed for a nitride-passivated device: the µFE,lin , µFE,sat , SS,\nVTH and ION/OFF ratio were 52.4 ± 15.0, 36.0 ± 13.9 cm2/Vs, 0.20 ± 0.03 V/decade, 0.1 ± 0.12 V and >2×109, respectively\n[Fig. 1(b) and (d)]. The Nit (NSS) values for the oxide and nitride passivated devices were 2.1 × 1011 (4.3 × 1016) and 3.6 × 1011 cm−2eV−1 (7.2 × 1016 cm−3eV−1), respectively.\nIt is interesting to discuss why the high mobility can be achieved for a-IZTO TFTs. In the a-IGZO system, the In 5s orbital with spherical symmetry is responsible for n-type conduction because its ionic radius is larger than those of Zn2+ and Ga3+ ions . Therefore, the higher indium content in a-IGZO system gives rise to the enhanced mobility due to the easy percolation path and its lower effective electron mass. On the other hand, the maximum indium content (<50 at%) was limited because the shallow oxygen vacancy defect can be created easily in the indium-rich IGZO system, leading to the strong compromise of VTH and *IOFF*. To control the net carrier density of the channel layer, the gallium cation was incorporated as a strong oxygen binder, i.e. a carrier suppressor in the a-IGZO semiconductor , . In this study, the Ga cation was replaced with a Sn cation. Therefore, the physical role of Sn ion is important for understanding the carrier transporting property in a-IZTO system. In this study, the relative cation composition of In and Sn ions was 40 and\n24 at.%, respectively. According to a recent calculation of the electronic structure, the Sn ion acts as a mobility enhancer, similar to the In ion in a-IZTO system, which can be attributed to the similar Sn 5s orbital structure to In 5s orbital .\nTherefore, the higher In and Sn content (∼64 at.%) in IZTO\nfilm facilitates the effective intercalation of the Sn or In 5s orbital or makes the percolation path smaller, leading to high mobility of the resulting a-IZTO TFTs , . Although the relative portion of the mobility enhancer including In and Sn ions is very high (∼64 at.%), the VTH and *IOFF* values of the resulting devices were not deteriorated. This suggests that the Sn cations make it difficult to create a shallow oxygen vacancy defect in the amorphous IZO system. In other words, the Sn cation appears to act as not only a mobility enhancer, but also a relatively good oxygen binder. This postulation was consistent with the result of first principle calculations: the formation energy of oxygen vacancy defects in Sn-doped IZO was ∼0.3 eV higher than that in the IZO system .\nIt is noted that the high mobility of a-IZTO TFTs is partly attributed to the hydrogen incorporation from the PECVDderived ESL and passivation layer.\nThe gate bias stress-induced instability of the oxide and nitride passivated devices were compared. The devices are stressed under the following conditions: the applied VGS\nvalues were (Vth + 20) and (Vth − 20) V for the positive bias stress (PBS) and negative bias stress (NBS) conditions, respectively and the VDS value was fixed to 5.1V for 3,600s.\nFig. 2(a) and (b) show the evolution of the transfer characteristics as a function of PBS time for the oxide and nitride passivated devices, respectively. The oxide passivated device exhibited stable behavior: the shift in VTH for the oxide passivated devices was ∼0.04. In contrast, the nitridepassivated device suffered from a VTH shift of 1.02V for an identical PBS duration. The inferior PBS instability of the nitride device can be attributed to its higher interfacial\ntrap density. The creation of new defect states in the channel layer can be excluded for the possible origin because stretchout phenomena were not observed in the subthreshold drain current region and capacitance voltage (C-V) characteristics, as shown in Fig. 2(b) and (d).\nThe superior stability of the oxide passivated device compared to the nitride passivated device was also observed for the NBS induced instability. Fig. 3(a) and (b) show the evolution of the transfer characteristics for both devices under NBS conditions. The application of NBS at room temperature on the oxide passivated device caused a smaller negative VTH shift of 0.67V [Fig. 3(a)]. In contrast, the NBS stability of the nitridepassivated device deteriorated substantially, which exhibited a negative VTH shift of ∼1.50 V, as shown in Fig. 3(b).\nThe superior NBS stability of the oxide passivated device was observed consistently from the change in the of C-V\ncharacteristics for both devices [Fig. 3(c) and (d)]. Here the superior NBS stability of the oxide passivated device is also consistent with its lower interfacial density. The inferior NBS\nstability of the nitride passivated device seems to be related to the larger incorporation of hydrogen to the IZTO channel region because the SiNx film contains more hydrogen species than the SiO2 film . Very recently, it was calculated the substitutional hydrogen at oxygen site (HO) can be stabilized to a pair of negative interstitial hydrogen (H−i ) and neutral oxygen vacancy (V0O) when the Fermi energy level (EF) is near the conduction band edge . This H-DX center can be converted to a shallow donor (H+O) and a free electron when the quasi-EF level near the channel interface moves downward due to the application of NBS . This deep-to-shallow state transition of hydrogen related defect center can give rise to the VTH instability. Therefore, the nitride passivated device would exhibit a larger VTH shift compared to the oxide passivated device , .\nIn summary, the IZTO TFTs exhibited promising device performance irrespective of the passivation structure: the µFE,lin , SS, VTH and ION/OFF ratio for both devices was 48.0 ∼ 52.4 cm2/Vs, 0.14 ∼ 0.20 V/decade, −0.5 ∼ 0.1 V and >2 × 108. In terms of the PBS and NBS stability, the oxide passivated device showed better resistance than the nitride passivated device, which can be attributed to its lower interfacial or bulk trap density. Therefore, the IZTO TFTs can be used as an alternative backplane device for the next generation AM displays."

Among the many promising channel materials such as indium gallium oxide (IGO) , indium zinc oxide (IZO) , zinc tin oxide (ZTO) , indium gallium tin oxide (IGTO) ,\nindium zinc tin oxide (IZTO) , the amorphous indium gallium zin tin oxide (a-IGZTO) system  emerges as a front-runner in the pursuit of high mobility, highlighting a potential to surpass the traditional a-IGZO system.\nIn a previous work, the synergic 5s-orbital intercalation of In3+ and Sn4+ can assist the formation of an efficient percolation conduction pathway due to the identical electron configuration ([Kr]4d105s0), leading to a decrease in the electron effective mass and thus improvement in terms of µFE .\nChoi et al. experimentally demonstrated that TFTs with a-IGZTO channel material have a superior a µFE of 46.7 cm2/Vs compared to that (10-20 cm2/Vs) of conventional a-IGZO TFTs . More recently, Lee et al.\nconducted a cation combinatorial investigation in a-IGZTO via co-sputtering of IGZO and SnO2 targets . The high performance in a-In0.29Ga0.35Zn0.11Sn0.25O TFTs with a remarkably high µFE of 85.9 cm2/Vs and good ION/OFF ratio of 3.1 × 108 were obtained through careful alloying of SnO2 and substitutional hydrogen sourced from a hydrogen-abundant plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposited SiO2 film.\nDespite its excellent electrical characteristics, the reliabilities of a-IGZTO TFTs remain one of the main issues for implementation in high-end OLED applications.\nFor example, the shift of VTH (1VTH) values for the a-In0.29Ga0.35Zn0.11Sn0.25O TFTs were 0.42 and −0.16 V\nafter positive bias stress (PBS, VGS,ST = VTH + 20 V) and negative bias stress (NBS, VGS,ST = VTH − 20 V) for 3,600 s, respectively .\nIn this letter, we report the fabrication of highly reliable a-IGZTO TFTs with superior performance: a µFE of 90.2 cm2/Vs, a low subthreshold swing (SS) of 0.10 V/decade, 0741-3106 © 2023 IEEE.

Unlike the co-sputtering of the previous IGZTO, the single IGZTO target is used to verify the practical feasibility application in the product line in this study.\nTo mitigate the risk of overestimation of the µFE value, the evaluation of TFTs involved defining the width of measured devices as the width of the island IGZTO channel layer, rather than considering the width of source/drain electrodes. Significantly, the 1VT H values were within the range of ± 0.08 V\nafter PBTS (VGS,ST = VTH + 20 V) and NBTS (VGS,ST =\nVTH − 20 V) at an elevated temperature of 60 ◦C for 3,600 s.\nThese performance and reliability outcomes demonstrate stateof-the-art characteristics compared to those for any metal oxide TFTs reported in the existing literature, highlighting their potential usage for innovative, high-resolution AMOLED displays.\nIi. Experimental Procedure\nBottom gate and top contact structures were fabricated on 100-nm-thick SiO2/Si substrates in which a conductive p\n+ substrate and thermal oxidation SiO2 film act as a gate electrode and dielectric, respectively. A 15-nm-thick a-IGZTO\nthin film as a semiconducting channel layer was deposited using RF-magnetron sputtering on the SiO2/Si substrate with the size of 25 mm × 25 mm. The 4-inch IGZTO targets with three compositions were used to deposit the IGZTO\nchannel layer, which was provided by Vital Materials Co. The sputtering power of the IGZTO target and chamber working pressure were 50 W and 2 mTorr, respectively. The sputter target composition ratios for Sample 1, 2, and 3 are In: Ga:\nZn: Sn = 50: 20: 20: 10, 60: 10: 20: 10, and 70: 10: 10: 10 at%,\nrespectively. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis revealed the cation compositions of In: Ga: Zn: Sn in three sample a-IGZTO films to be ① 51: 24: 21: 4 at%, ② 60: 14: 20: 6 at%,\nand ③ 65: 13: 7: 15 at%, respectively. The slight disparity between the target and film compositions can be attributed to variations in the sputtering yield of cation elements and/or potential instrumental analytical error. Notably, the sum of\n[In] + [Sn] of the target (film) composition for Device 1, 2 and 3 was 60 (55), 70 (66) and 80 (80) at%, respectively.\nThe 100-nm-thick ITO films were deposited by DC-magnetron sputtering as the S/D electrode. The channel and S/D layers were patterned by metal shadow masks. The width (W) and length (L) of the fabricated channel were 1000 µm and 300 µm, respectively (Figure 1 (a)). After depositing the a-IGZTO channel, a 5-nm-thick SiO2 film used as a passivation layer (PVL) was deposited on the a-IGZTO via the PEALD process (100 W, 1 Torr, 150 ◦C). The fabricated devices were annealed at 400 ◦C for 1 h under an air atmosphere.\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nFigure **1(b)** shows the glancing-incidence X-ray diffraction\n(GI-XRD) patterns for the three IGZTO films. The a-IGZTO\nfilms had no discernible peak, suggesting that they were amorphous. The surface roughness (denoted as the root mean square roughness, Rrms) revealed values of approximately 0.4 nm, demonstrating uniform and reasonable values regardless of the composition ratio of a-IGZTO (Figure 1 **(c)-(e)**).\nThe field-effect mobility was calculated from the transfer characteristics as µFE = Lgm/ (WCOXVDS) at VDS = 0.1 V.\nDevice 1 showed a reasonable µFE value of 32.4 cm2/Vs, SS of 0.11 V/decade, and a positive VTH of 0.14 V\n(also see **Table** I). As the ratio of ([In] + [Sn])/ ([In] +\n[Ga] + [Zn] + [Sn]) increased from 55 at% (Device 1) to 66 at% (Device 2), a significant improvement in terms of the µFE value was observed: they exhibited a high µFE value of 90.2 cm2/Vs, low SS of 0.10 V/decade, and moderate VTH of −0.4 V. Device 3 with the ([In] + [Sn])/ ([In] +\n[Ga] + [Zn] + [Sn]) of 80 at% showed an even higher µFE value of 135.1 cm2/Vs. However, it suffered a negative displacement of VTH (−2.6 V). These results are consistent with the theoretical prediction that an increasing fraction of In and Sn facilitates the effective percolation conduction pathway and reduces effective electron mass. The negative displacement of VTH indicates that the free electron density in a-IGZTO channel tends to increase with increasing [In]\nfraction, which is attributed to the weak In-O oxygen bonding strength, leading to generation of oxygen vacancies , , . The corresponding output characteristics confirm our interpretation (Figure 2 **(d)-(f)**).\nIncorporation of the multivalent Sn ion in the semiconducting IGZO film should increase the adverse trap\n| Comparison of Electrical Parameters for Three Devices   |             |             |              |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|--------------|\n| Device ID                                               |             |             |              |\n| μ r E (cm 2 /Vs)                                        | 32.4 ± 0.7  | 90.2 ± 10.8 | 135.1 ± 19.5 |\n| SS (V/decade)                                           | 0.11 ± 0.03 | 0.10 ± 0.03 | 0.12 ± 0.04  |\n| VTH (V)                                                 | 0.14 ± 0.3  | -0.4 ± 0.4  | -2.6 ± 0.6   |\n| N T παν (10 17 cV 1 cm 3 )                              | 2.7 ± 0.7   | 2.4 ± 0.7   | 2.9 ± 1.0    |\n| PBS/NBS ( DVTH )                                        | < ± 0.02    | < ± 0.03    | < ± 0.11     |\n| PBTS/NBTS ( ΔV TH )                                     | < ± 0.05    | < ± 0.08    | < ± 0.36     |\ndensity by the action of the existing Sn 2+ gap-state, which was confirmed in Device 3 with the largest N T,max value\n(2.9 × 10 17 eV − 1 cm − 3 ). In this regard, it is important to discuss the reason why the lowest N T,max value (2.4 ×\n10 17 eV- 1 cm-3 ) was observed for Device 2. Figure 3 presents the SIMS depth profiles depicting the intensity of H and SnH in the IGZTO films fabricated using different composition ratios. A clear trend is observed, indicating an increase in hydrogen-doping concentration within a -IGZTO films as the Sn fraction increases. This phenomenon can be attributed to the presence of unreacted H ligands in DIPAS\nor residual OH groups during the ALD process of SiO 2 film growth, to bind with Sn, resulting in the formation of SnH  .\nThe hydrogen doping in the Sn-containing IGZTO system plays a critical role in determining the trap density and bias stability of the resulting field-effect transistors.

        "text": "Activation Of Igzo Devices At 150°C Via Reduction Process Using Hydrogen Gas During Sputtering\nYusaku Magari*, S G Mehadi Aman**, Daichi Sasaki**, Mamoru Furuta** \n*Interdisciplinary Faculty of Science and Engineering, Shimane University, Shimane 690-8504, Japan\n**School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Kochi University of Technology, Kochi 782-8502, Japan \nIn this study, we propose an activation method of IGZO films at 150 °C for future flexible electronics. By adding hydrogen gas during IGZO sputtering, near-conduction band minimum defect states and carrier concentration in the IGZO film could effectively be decreased by annealing at 150 °C. We successfully demonstrated high-performance IGZO thin-film transistors (TFTs), Schottky diodes, and metal-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MESFETs) at a maximum processing temperature of 150 °C.\nAmorphous oxide semiconductors; hydrogenated IGZO; TFT; Schottky diode; MES-FET; flexible electronics; magnetron sputtering \n1. Introduction\nTransparent amorphous oxide semiconductors (TAOSs),\nparticularly In–Ga–Zn–O (IGZO) have received much attention due to their superior electrical properties (μFE > 10 cm2V-1s-1) even when deposited at room temperature . Therefore, they are considered to be promising to develop future flexible electronics, including flexible displays, wearable devices, and chemical and/or optical sensors [3–5]. However, during the IGZO sputtering process, various type of defects generated in IGZO films by highenergy particles, such as recoil argon and oxygen ions. Thus, a thermal annealing step typically at around 300 °C (i.e. the activation process) is necessary to reduce the defects and achieve the desired device performances . However, such thermal treatment at a high temperature is not suitable for the direct formation of IGZO devices on a cost-effective flexible polymer substrate including PET and PEN, which has a relatively low glasstransition temperature (< 200 °C). The oxygen vacancy is a typical defects in oxide semiconductors; thus, an oxidation acceleration process of IGZO films, such as O3 annealing, wet O2 annealing, high-pressure O2 annealing, and simultaneous additional external energy (ultraviolet, electric fields, and magnetic fields) and thermal treatments, have been proposed for low-temperature activation of the IGZO films (< 200 °C) [7–13].\nIn this study, we propose an activation method of IGZO films at 150 °C via reduction process using hydrogen gas during sputter deposition of IGZO. We successfully demonstrated highperformance thin-film transistors (TFTs), Schottky diodes, and metal-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MES-FETs) at a maximum process temperature of 150 °C, which is useful for flexible electronics. In addition, the proposed method doesn't require any additional expensive equipment and/or change in the conventional oxide TFT fabrication method; thus, it's suitable for mass production. We have also explained the basic mechanism of the hydrogenated IGZO, and that will be helpful for further research. \n2. Experimental Methods 2.1 Hydrogenated Igzo Deposition Conditions\nAn IGZO film was deposited by DC magnetron sputtering, without substrate heating, from a ceramic InGaZnO4 (In:Ga:Zn = 1:1:1 atom.%) target using a mixture gas of Ar, O2, and H2, as shown in Fig. 1(a). The O2 and H2 gas ratios were defined as R[O2] = \nO2/(Ar+O2+H2) and R[H2] = H2/(Ar+O2+H2), respectively. For hydrogenated IGZO (hereafter denoted as IGZO:H), R[H2] was varied from 0 to 9.9%, while R[O2] was fixed at 1%. The deposition pressure and DC power were maintained at 1 Pa and 80 W. \n2.2 Device Fabrication Processes\nSchottky diode, and (d) MES-FET. All devices were fabricated at a maximum process temperature of 150 °C on a heavily doped p+-\nSi substrate for TFTs, and on a glass substrate for Schottky diodes and MES-FETs. After IGZO deposition, the films were annealed in air at 150 °C for 1 h for all devices. Then, stacked film of molybdenum/aluminum/molybdenum (Mo/Al/Mo) as source/drain electrodes for TFTs, and a silver oxide (AgxO) for Shcottky gate were deposited by RF magnetron sputtering. Au was deposited on AgxO by vacuum evaporation. The TFTs were fabricated through a shadow mask with channel length (L) of 350 μm and width (W) of 1400 μm. The Schottky electrode was patterned by photolithography and lift-off procedures. The radius of the Schottky contact was 100 μm for Schottky diodes, and L of 10 μm and W of 100 μm for MES-FETs. The detailed fabrication process of the devices appears elsewhere [14–17]. \n3. Results And Discussion 3.1 Electrical And Structural Properties Of Igzo:H Films\nFigure 2 shows the hydrogen depth profile in the IGZO films. The hydrogen ion intensity in the IGZO increased upon increasing R[H2] values. The hydrogen concentration in the IGZO:H film deposited at R[H2] of 5% and 8% was more than one order of magnitude higher than that in IGZO without R[H2]. This result indicates that over 1021 cm-3 hydrogen is present in IGZO:H films deposited at R[H2] of 5% and 8%. \nFigure 3 shows the carrier concentration of the IGZO:H films deposited at various R[H2] values and constant R[O2] of 1% before and after annealing at 150 °C. For the as-deposited films, the carrier concentration of the IGZO:H (R[H2] > 2%) increased over two orders of magnitude from the IGZO deposited without H2 (1.0×1017 cm-3). It is well known that hydrogen acts as a shallow donor in IGZO ; thus, the increase in the carrier concentration of asdeposited IGZO:H films with the R[H2] values was considered to be due to hydrogen doping effects. In contrast, the number of free carriers in IGZO:H deposited at R[H2] of 5% or more significantly decreased upon annealing at 150 °C. Although the hydrogen induced the formation of free carriers in the as-deposited films, the carrier concentration of the films effectively reduced by lowtemperature annealing. This result suggests that the added hydrogen during sputtering compensated the defects in IGZO after low-temperature annealing. \nFigure 5 shows transfer characteristics of the IGZO TFT after annealing at 150 and 300 °C, and the IGZO:H TFT after annealing at 150 °C. Table 1 summarizes the electrical properties of the TFTs. Although the TFT exhibited switching properties, a huge hysteresis \n(VH) of 6.52 V was observed in IGZO TFT annealed at 150 °C. In contrast, the IGZO:H TFT exhibited excellent switching properties with a negligible VH, field-effect mobility (μFE) of 13.4 cm2V-1s-1 subthreshold swing (SS) of 0.13 V, even after annealing at 150 °C. \nThese values are comparable to that of the IGZO TFT after annealing at 300 °C as shown in table 1. \nTo investigate the electronic states in IGZO:H films, hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HAXPES) analysis with an excitation X-ray energy of 7940 eV was performed. This allows us to obtain information from the bulk regions without ion sputtering. Figure 4 shows the HAXPES spectra around the bandgap (Eg) region obtained from the IGZO films annealed at 150 and 300 °C, and the IGZO:H film annealed at 150 °C. The near-valence band maximum \n(near-VBM) and the near-conduction band minimum (near-CBM) \nstates were clearly observed in all samples. The former states lie in the VBM energy expands to ~ 1.5 eV toward the Fermi level (EF), and the latter states were located at just below EF. For the IGZO \nfilms, both the near-VBM and near-CBM states decreased upon increasing annealing temperature from 150 to 300 °C, indicating that thermal annealing at 300 °C is effective for reducing the number of subgap defects. For the IGZO:H film, the number of near-VBM states increased, whereas that of near-CBM states decreased upon introducing hydrogen. The density of near-CBM \nstates in 150 °C-annealed IGZO:H is comparable to that in 300 °Cannealed IGZO. Based on density functional theory analysis, Körner et al. reported that metal–metal (M–M) bond form nearCBM states; such defect states were suppressed by incorporating hydrogen to form M–H bonds . Bang et al. reported that the anionic hydrogens stabilized at the oxygen vacancy sites, whereas the M–H bonds form near-VBM states . It is considered the hydrogen introduced during sputtering preferentially binds to metal (M–H) because the hydrogen concentration in the IGZO:H film was more than one order of magnitude higher than that in IGZO as shown in Fig. 2. Although IGZO:H had a higher density of nearVBM states than IGZO, such deep states might have little impact on electron transport properties in the IGZO devices. \n3.2 Electrical Properties Of Igzo:H Tfts\n| Table 1.

Table 2 summarizes the electrical properties of the Schottky diodes. For the IGZO Schottky diode annealed at 150 °C, poor diode properties with JF/R of 1.0×105, Ib of 0.86 eV, and n of 1.45 were obtained. In contrast, superior diode properties of JF/R of 3.8×1010, Ib of 1.17 eV, and n of 1.07 were obtained in the IGZO:H Schottky diode annealed at 150 °C. These values are comparable to those of IGZO Schottky diode obtained after annealing at 300 °C. Moreover, we demonstrated excellent electrical performance of the Schottky diode even on PEN substrate. To the best of our knowledge, the obtained IGZO:H Schottky diode exhibited the highest JF/R value in the reported IGZO-based Schottky diodes. \n3.4 Electrical Properties Of Igzo:H Mes-Fets\nFigure 7 shows the transfer characteristics of the MES-FETs with IGZO single layer channel and IGZO:H/IGZO stacked channel after annealing at 150 °C. Table 3 summarizes the electrical properties of the MES-FETs. The MES-FET with IGZO single layer channel showed high off-current. This is due to a poor Schottky gate contact to the IGZO as shown in Fig. 6. On the other hand, by applying an IGZO:H on IGZO (IGZO:H/IGZO), the offcurrent of MES-FET markedly decreased while slightly increased on-current. An on-off current ratio (Ion/off) of 4.2×108, a Vth of -5.9 V and a SS of 0.15 Vdec-1 were achieved for the IGZO:H/IGZO stacked channel MES-FET. The drain conductance of 1.1×10-4 S \nwas obtained from the output characteristics. The obtained MESFET characteristics were significantly improved compared to the previously reported amorphous oxide MES-FET characteristics despite low-temperature process of 150°C. \n| Table 2.

Conclusions\nWe proposed the hydrogenated IGZO for reducing the activation temperature of IGZO films below 150 °C. The hydrogenated IGZO \nwas produced by adding moderate amount of hydrogen during IGZO sputtering. Although the presence of the additive hydrogen during the sputtering increased the carrier concentration of the IGZO more than 1019 cm-3, those free carriers were effectively decreased below 1017 cm-3 by low-temperature annealing at 150 °C. \nThe electrical properties of the IGZO:H TFTs fabricated at 150 °C \nsignificantly improved with μFE of 13.4 cm2V-1s-1, SS of 0.13 V, \nand VH of 0.61 V. In addition, superior properties with an extremely large JF/R of 3.8×1010 for Schottky diodes, and Ion/off of 4.2×108 for MES-FETs were achieved at 150 °C. The proposed method is very promising for the fabrication of oxide devices below the softening temperature of plastic substrates for future flexible electronics. \n5.

Introduction\nThin-film transistors (TFTs), based on field-effect transistors (FETs), are manufactured through a bottom–up process that involves the systematic stacking of layers. This bottom–up approach bestows significant process advantages, offering a considerable level of flexibility in structural design and material selection, thereby providing TFTs with a highly versatile platform. This design flexibility allows TFTs to extend beyond display backplanes [1–3] into various device areas, including digital and analog circuits [4–9] and image sensors [10–12]. In particular, many studies have been carried out recently to apply emerging materials such as organics [13–17], metal-oxide semiconductors [18–21], twodimensional (2D) materials [22–24], and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) [25–28], rather than Si, as TFT channels.\nWhile demonstrations have often been limited to the unit device level, proving practical device feasibility requires expanding to array scale. These array types are broadly categorized as passive-matrix  and active-matrix . The passive-matrix takes the form of a crossbar array and has the advantage of a simple structure and low manufacturing cost. However, resolution improvement is constrained by crosstalk issues between adjacent pixels in the passive-matrix . On the other hand, active-matrix, with a TFT in each pixel enabling independent pixel operation, avoids crosstalk and can achieve higher resolution . This has led to the adoption of active-matrix not only in displays but also in various sensors, including photodetectors [34–36] and pressure sensors [37–39], etc.\nIn this review, we highlight research outcomes on active-matrix-based displays and various sensors, focusing particularly on studies implementing active-matrix with TFTs based on emerging materials. Furthermore, we revisit the specific purposes served by each sensor and explore the technologies they use. This review explains the interest of the use of the active-matrix approach across diverse applications and investigates its potential for expanding practicality from lab to industry.\n2. Thin-Film Transistors And Active-Matrix Array\nTFTs are mainly fabricated in a bottom–up process, unlike Si-based metal-oxidesemiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs), which are manufactured in a top-down process . A bottom–up process-based TFT is not only free in terms of designing device structure but also has excellent substrate compatibility [41–43]. In addition, a TFT can be implemented based on various processes such as spin coating , inkjet printing ,\nphotolithography , and thermal evaporation . Through considerable effort, large-area processes have also become possible. Securing large-area process technology has enabled development beyond the characteristic evaluation at the unit device level to TFT-based system levels, such as digital and analog circuits, including active-matrix arrays. In particular, active matrices can be applied to various applications and offer many advantages. The active-matrix array is a method originally used for addressing the pixels in the display. Unlike the passive-matrix, which is a crossbar array that crosses horizontally and vertically, the active-matrix array contains one transistor per unit pixel. In the activematrix, pixels are selected by controlling the on/off of the TFT. The very low off current of the TFT prevents the crosstalk issues that are problematic in the passive-matrix. This leads the active-matrix array to be used in various ways, such as sensor arrays and displays.\nAs mentioned earlier, the active-matrix array was initially adopted as an addressing method for displays and was later used to drive sensor arrays beyond displays. The driving methods of a sensor array and a display are not significantly different. A display converts electrical signals within the system into light. On the other hand, in a sensor array, the opposite process is achieved by converting information such as light and temperature into electrical signals through sensor devices and processing them in the internal system. In other words, both the display and the sensor array are the same up to the point of selecting a specific column through a switching transistor, and the only difference is the direction of signal transmission through the data line.\nThe implementation of an active-matrix array allows for the expression and sensing of more information, such as displaying a specific image or sensing the distribution of temperature or pressure. These unique features of the active-matrix array contribute to the ongoing development of advanced display and sensor systems.\n3. Active-Matrix-Based Displays 3.1. Liquid Crystal Display (Lcd)\nA liquid crystal display (LCD) is one of the types of displays and is currently used in most televisions and monitors. The working principle is to control the amount of light transmitted by controlling the arrangement of liquid crystals located between two polarizers through voltage. To express color, color filters corresponding to red, green, and blue are used. Additionally, there are LCDs that are driven by using a reflector instead of a backlight to reflect external light. Cong et al. demonstrated an active-matrix polymer-dispersed liquid crystal (PDLC) seven-segment display using CNT TFT . They utilized PDLC,\nformed by embedding micro-sized liquid crystals into a polymer matrix, and controlled the transparent or opaque state based on the refractive index difference between the polymer matrix and the liquid crystal, depending on the applied voltage (Figure 1a,b). The proposed PDLC display has a structure in which two ITO electrodes are sandwiched above and below the liquid crystal (Figure 1c). Figure 1d illustrates a CNT TFT-based backplane for driving a seven-segment display. The fabricated PDLC display demonstrated the ability to clearly distinguish light transmittance in the visible light region based on the voltage applied to both ends of the PDLC. Building on this capability, they successfully displayed numerical information by selectively controlling the liquid crystal of each pixel through CNT TFT.\n3.2. Light-Emitting Diode (Led)\nUnlike LCD, light-emitting diode does not require a backlight and the pixels emit light on their own; so, the pixels can be turned off completely, making real darkness possible. In addition, since there is no need for layers such as backlights and polarizers, as required in LCD, it is possible to implement thinner displays. These light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are divided into organic LED (OLED) [ 53 - 57 ], micro- LED ( μ -LED) [ 58 , 59 ], and quantum dots LED (QLED) [ 60,61 ], depending on the materials used, and each is being actively researched and developed by several researchers. In particular, many attempts to apply emerging materials such as organic, oxide semiconductor, and 2D materials as backplanes have been reported.\nPeng et al.  developed a driving circuit for an 8 × 8 active-matrix LED based on organic TFTs (OTFTs) on paper [ 62 ]. They utilized paper with high roughness as a substrate, gradually alleviating the roughness by forming screen-printed silver and parylene-C as the gate electrode and gate dielectric. The reduced surface roughness led to the successful implementation of an 8 × 8 organic transistor array with a 100% yield (Figure 2a,b). Finally, they integrated LEDs into the array and demonstrated the display of character information by controlling the active-matrix LEDs with the proposed organic transistor array (Figure 2c ).\nThis highlights the feasibility of implementing functional circuits, such as active-matrix arrays, using organic semiconductors even on rough substrates like paper.\nUm et al. developed an active-matrix LED display by integrating GaN µ -LEDs with an amorphous indium-gallium-zinc-oxide (a-IGZO) TFT backplane [ 63 ]. First, they fabricated the a-IGZO TFT backplane and GaN µ -LED pixel array on glass and sapphire substrates, respectively. Subsequently, they completed the implementation of a 128 × 384 µ-LED\narray display by integrating the GaN µ-LED on the sapphire substrate into the a-IGZO\nTFT backplane through flip chip bonding (Figure 2d). The flip chip bonding process was conducted below 100 ◦C, ensuring no deterioration in the characteristics of the TFT\nbackplane, and consequently, text and portrait images were successfully displayed on the display.\nChoi et al. attempted to configure the backplane of the OLED display with MoS2 TFT . They optimized the characteristics of MoS2 TFT before applying it as a driving TFT. The top and bottom of the MoS2 channel were encapsulated with Al2O3, resulting in high on-current and low hysteresis characteristics. The introduction of the Al2O3 layer reduced the charge trap density at the interface, contributing to improved electrical properties.\nUsing MoS2 with enhanced characteristics, they implemented an OLED display on a flexible polymer substrate. The positive threshold voltage of the MoS2 TFT reduced power consumption as it did not require a separate voltage to turn off the pixel. They demonstrated real-time control of text images by attaching a flexible OLED display with the manufactured MoS2 backplane to a wrist (Figure 2e).\nBaek et al. implemented a CNT TFT-based active-matrix QLED display . In particular, to investigate the optimum design for a high-performance QLED array, they compared the characteristics of a total of four types of QLED arrays according to the type of driving TFT (p- or n-type) and the connection configuration between QLED and the driving transistor (conventional QLED or inverted QLED) (Figure 2f). They passivated Si3N4 on p-type CNT TFT to prepare n-type CNT TFT. The conversion of CNT TFT to n-type operation through Si3N4 passivation is because the positive fixed charge in Si3N4 causes ntype doping and protects it from atmospheric oxygen and water, which cause p-type doping effects . Subsequently, the distinction between conventional QLED and inverted QLED was defined based on whether the upper Al and lower ITO electrodes served as cathode/anode or anode/cathode, respectively. At this point, depending on whether ITO, the bottom electrode of QLED, is in contact with the drain or source of the driving transistor, the cases were classified into four structures: (i) drain contact with the bottom anode (DCBA), (ii) source contact with the bottom cathode (SCBC), (iii) drain contact with the bottom cathode (DCBC), and (iv) source contact with the bottom anode (SCBA). As a result of comparing the electrical and optical characteristics of the four structures, when the QLED was connected to the source of the driving TFT (SCBC, SCBA), it showed poorer performance than when connected to the drain. This is because the voltage between the gate and source, which determines the drain current, is reduced due to the voltage drop occurring at the QLED. Therefore, when applying a p-type or n-type TFT as a driving TFT,\nit is advantageous to adopt the DCBA and DCBC structures. Based on this, they ultimately produced a 5 × 5 QLED array with p-type and n-type CNT TFTs as driving TFTs and demonstrated real-time display of character images.\n3.3. Light-Emitting Electrochemical Cell (LEC)\nUnlike OLED, which requires additional layers such as an electron injection layer and an electron transport layer in addition to the light-emitting layer, a light-emitting electrochemical cell (LEC) has a simple structure consisting of a light-emitting layer and two metal electrodes [67–70]. This simple structure is a great advantage, especially when implementing stretchable light-emitting devices. In order to provide elasticity to existing OLEDs, elasticity must be imparted to all layers, including the electron and hole injection layers as well as the light-emitting layer. However, in the case of LEC, only the lightemitting layer needs to be elastic; therefore, the process' difficulty is low.\nLiu et al. utilized the advantages of LEC to implement an organic-based stretchable active-matrix organic LEC (OLEC) array . They first fabricated a stretchable activematrix TFT array to drive a stretchable OLEC array. They mixed a crosslinker containing flexible polydimethysiloxane into conjugated polymers to prevent the semiconductor layer from delamination from the perfluorinated elastomer used as the gate dielectric when Liu et al. utilized the advantages of LEC to implement an organic-based stretchable active-matrix organic LEC (OLEC) array . They first fabricated a stretchable activematrix TFT array to drive a stretchable OLEC array. They mixed a crosslinker containing flexible polydimethysiloxane into conjugated polymers to prevent the semiconductor layer from delamination from the perfluorinated elastomer used as the gate dielectric when the TFT is stretched (Figure 3a). At this time, the introduced crosslinker strengthened the bond between the two layers by crosslinking the conjugated polymers and the elastomeric dielectric layer during the annealing process, thereby preventing delamination of the semiconductor layer when stretching. Based on this, they successfully fabricated a stretchable TFT array (Figure 3b,c). Then, OLEC was integrated on the TFT array \n(Figure 3d), and it was demonstrated that OLEC could be driven through OTFT both without twisting and with twisting (Figure 3e,f). \nthe TFT is stretched (Figure 3a).

Active-Matrix-Based Sensors\nUnlike displays that process internal electrical signals to output visual information, sensors play a crucial role by receiving information about specific external elements and converting it into corresponding electrical signals. Sensors are categorized based on the detection target, ranging from particles like photons [72–75] and gases [76–78] to external physical changes such as pressure , strain [81–83], and temperature . The development of these various sensors can provide many benefits to humans, such as preventing accidents from occurring caused by harmful elements such as toxic gases and ultraviolet, and enabling an accurate evaluation of the strength of products produced at manufacturing sites. Furthermore, by mimicking human sense organs such as vision and touch, sensors can contribute to the ongoing development of artificial intelligence and robotics, paving the way for innovative technologies in the future.\n4.1. Photosensors\nPhotosensors are devices that convert optical signals into electrical signals and can perform the function of vision among the human senses. In addition, photosensors can be manufactured by targeting visible light , ultraviolet [86–88], and infrared \ndepending on the purpose. In particular, it is interesting that the presence or absence of light irradiation that humans cannot see, such as ultraviolet and infrared, can be detected through the photosensor.\nTakahashi et al. achieved an imager capable of detecting visible light by monolithically integrating a CNT-based backplane with organic photodiodes . They utilized PI substrates to take advantage of the material advantages of CNT, regioregular poly(3hexylthiophene) (P3HT), and -phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) in both TFTs and photodiodes. This approach resulted in the successful demonstration of a visible light imager with flexibility. Moreover, they integrated a Gd2O2S/Tb scintillator film, capable of converting X-rays into green light, into the visible light imager (Figure 4a,b). The introduction of the Gd2O2S/Tb scintillator film facilitated X-ray detection without causing damage to the organic active layer of the photodiode (Figure 4c).\nX-rays possess strong energy and can be harmful to the human body, necessitating their detection for safety. In contrast, near-infrared (NIR), like X-rays, is invisible to humans but has very weak energy and is not harmful to the human body. Detection of NIR is significant as it can be utilized in various applications, including temperature measurement, near-field communication, and medical fields. In medical applications, the deep penetration characteristics of NIR enable measurements such as heart rate and oxygen saturation. Li et al. employed solution-processed In2O3 to construct the backplane of a NIR sensor array . Additionally, they integrated solution-processed In2O3, known for its high electron mobility, into an NIR-responsive hybrid phototransistor along with an organic bulk heterojunction (Figure 4d). PTB7-Th and BTPV-4F were used as donor and acceptor materials, respectively, for the organic bulk heterojunction. Among the two materials, BTPV-4F is responsible for the actual absorption of NIR, while PTB7-Th is intended to improve the separation of electron–hole pairs through a built-in electric field generated by the formation of an organic bulk heterojunction. Finally, they manufactured a 16 × 16 hybrid NIR sensor array based on unit pixels in the form of one transistor–one phototransistor and successfully detected the NIR irradiation area.\nThe detection of a specific wavelength band, such as X-ray or NIR, is determined by the intended use of the sensor . To imitate human vision, the sensor must be designed to target the visible light region, and each pixel should have the ability to distinguish between red, green, and blue light. Kim et al. introduced CdSe quantum dots as the active layer of a phototransistor on top of an a-IGZO transistor as a method to implement a color-selective imaging function. They initially demonstrated photodetector arrays with phototransistors capable of detecting red, green, and blue light, respectively, arranged in the lateral direction.\nSubsequently, to enhance the resolution, they attempted to vertically stack the quantum dots responsible for red, green, and blue. By investigating the photoresponse characteristics according to the stacking order of the red, green, and blue quantum dots, it was shown that stacking them from the bottom is the optimal structure. Based on this, they finally implemented color-selective photodetection at the same region by integrating an a-IGZO\nTFT-based backplane and a phototransistor with vertically stacked quantum dots.\nThe primary function of a photosensor is to detect light, but when its light-sensing properties are utilized, it can be actively employed in medical applications, such as for measuring a person's heart rate and oxygen saturation. Ruiz-Preciado et al. fabricated a highly flexible all-organic photosensor array by integrating organic photodiodes and OTFTs through an inkjet-printing process [ 93 ]. They demonstrated photoplethysmography (PPG) measurement by directing a red LED onto a finger and observing the pulsatdetection.

Gas Sensor 4.2. Gas Sensor\nGas sensors are widely applied as devices that detect the presence of target gas in a specific space. In particular, measuring oxygen concentration or detecting harmful gases can inform people in the area of danger early and help them evacuate. Therefore, it is important for gas sensors to detect even minute levels of concentration quickly. Kim et al. \ndemonstrated NO2 gas detection using a two-step grown MoS2 TFT-based gas sensor array (Figure 5a) . Here, the two-step growing method proceeds with a sputtering step followed by a thermal sulfurization step. For both the switching TFT and the sensing TFT, two-step grown MoS2 was applied as a channel, but the switching TFT was passivated with a SiO2 layer to prevent reaction with gas (Figure 5b). In the case of the sensing TFT, \nthe drain current decreased as the concentration of NO2 gas increased (Figure 5c). This means that NO2 gas increases the resistance of the MoS2 channel, and when the concentration of each NO2 gas was 128 ppm, the resistance increased by about 60% compared to the initial resistance (Figure 5d). The reason why MoS2 TFT was able to react to NO2 is because two-step grown MoS2 has a poly-crystalline structure and many grain boundaries. In fact, for this reason, defects are intentionally formed to improve reactivity to gas. \nGas sensors are widely applied as devices that detect the presence of target gas in a\nspecific space.

In fact, for this reason, defects are intentionally formed to improve reactivity to gas.\nUnlike photosensors and pressure sensors, gas sensors have not yet been implemented at the array level in many cases. This may be because, unlike other sensors that can obtain meaningful information by detecting specific image information or pressure Unlike photosensors and pressure sensors, gas sensors have not yet been implemented at the array level in many cases. This may be because, unlike other sensors that can obtain meaningful information by detecting specific image information or pressure distribution, gas sensors only need to detect the presence and concentration level of a specific gas.\nTherefore, if expanded in the direction of simultaneously detecting two or more different gases rather than just one specific gas, a gas sensor array could also be attractive.\n4.3. Pressure Sensors\nShin et al. implemented a pressure sensor array based on graphene FET with airdielectric . They used two plastic panels connected by elastic joints as a substrate and created source/drain patterns and gate patterns on each panel. Afterward, by folding the elastic joint to the boundary, the two panels were completely overlapped and the FET\nstructure was completed. At this time, the thickness of the air-dielectric corresponding to the gap between the graphene and the top gate is determined by the thickness of the elastomeric partition spacers. Therefore, the thickness of the air-dielectric and the pressure are inversely proportional, and as the pressure increases, the thickness of the gate dielectric of the graphene FET decreases. This means that an increase in pressure induces the capacitance of the gate dielectric, ultimately leading to an increase in the current of the graphene FET. Additionally, they successfully demonstrated a transparent pressure sensor array by introducing Ag NWs as electrodes (Figure 6a–c). However, the proposed graphene FET-based pressure sensor has limitations due to high off current; so, for low-power operation, the addition of FETs or other alternatives was needed to select each cell.\nJang et al. replaced graphene with MoS2, a well-known 2D semiconductor, as the channel layer to address the high-off-current issue, a drawback in existing graphene FETbased pressure sensors . Although MoS2 has a two-dimensional structure, it differs from graphene in having a band gap suitable for a semiconductor channel. Notably, MoS2 exhibits the ability to control electrical and optical properties depending on the number of layers. In the case of monolayer MoS2, it possesses a direct band gap and outstanding optical properties. By incorporating monolayer MoS2, which exhibits both excellent electrical and optical properties, into the pressure sensor, they successfully developed a pressure sensor array with low power consumption. Moreover, they leveraged the optical properties of monolayer MoS2 to enhance pressure sensitivity further by introducing mechanoluminescent materials that emit visible light when compression or friction force is applied (Figure 6d). Through this approach, when pressure is applied to the MoS2-based pressure sensor, not only does the dielectric thickness decrease, but the additional effect of excess carriers being created in MoS2 by the emission of mechanoluminescent materials is introduced. This results in an increased amount of change in current for the same pressure\nAmong the existing pressure sensor types, in addition to the previously mentioned FET-type, many piezoresistive pressure sensors have been reported. The piezoresistive type offers the advantage of not only having a simple structure but also exhibiting high pressure sensitivity and enabling continuous sensing. Zhao et al. developed a pressure sensor utilizing a 64 × 64 CNT TFT-based backplane and a piezoresistive film (PRF) blended with CNT and thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) elastomer (Figure 6f,g) . Before the fullscale demonstration, they conducted a comprehensive investigation into the characteristics of the pressure sensor. The sensor demonstrated faster response times, with rising and falling times of 5 ms and 3 ms, respectively, compared to existing PRF-based pressure sensors. Additionally, the proposed pressure sensor exhibited excellent sensitivity and spatial resolution. Notably, it was demonstrated that the sensor could detect even the footprint of an artificial honeybee weighing 6.7 g, as illustrated in Figure 6h.\nThe high sensitivity of the pressure sensor allows it to detect even minute changes in pressure; so, it can also be applied to biosignal monitoring applications with weak signal strength. Karner-Petritz et al. implemented a pressure sensor array, utilizing a poly(vinylidene fluoride: trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF:TrFE))-based ferroelectric transducer and a DNTT-based OTFT for each pixel . They fabricated an organic-based pressure sensor array on a 1 um thick parylene substrate (Figure 6i). The ultra-flexible properties of the parylene substrate allow the pressure sensor array to be attached to uneven human skin. Exploiting this flexibility, they measured pulse waves using pressure sensors aligned with the direction of blood flow (Figure 6j). Moreover, they demonstrated the extraction of Exploiting this flexibility, they measured pulse waves using pressure sensors aligned with the direction of blood flow (Figure 6j). Moreover, they demonstrated the extraction of pulse wave velocity and blood pressure by analyzing the time difference at the peak point of the pulse wave from sensors spaced apart from each other.\nEfforts persist in enhancing the performance of diverse pressure sensors, with endeavors directed towards incorporating additional features, including transparency. The pursuit of high-performance pressure sensors holds significance as it can pave the way for the creation of bio-health devices characterized by low latency and high precision. Such devices enable the monitoring of vital biological indicators like blood pressure and heart rate, contributing to advancements in healthcare technology. \npulse wave velocity and blood pressure by analyzing the time difference at the peak point\n![10_image_0.png](10_image_0.png)\nof the pulse wave from sensors spaced apart from each other.\nEfforts persist in enhancing the performance of diverse pressure sensors, with endeavors directed towards incorporating additional features, including transparency.

Such devices enable the monitoring of vital biological indicators like blood pressure and heart rate, contributing to advancements in healthcare technology.\n4.4. Strain Sensors Sun et al. fabricated an active-matrix strain sensor array by integrating a P(VDF-TrFE)-\nbased piezoelectric nanogenerator (NG) and a graphene FET . The bottom electrode of the piezoelectric NG and the gate electrode of the graphene FET are connected with patterned graphene (Figure 7a). Additionally, the conductivity of the graphene FET is determined by the potential of the graphene gate electrode through the electrolyte. As a result of evaluating the characteristics of the proposed strain sensor, they showed that when strain is applied to the device, the conductivity of the graphene FET is modulated as a piezoelectric potential is generated due to the alignment of the dipole in the PVDF that constitutes the piezoelectric NG. They further expanded the sensor to a 4 × 4 array based on piezopotential-gated graphene FETs and visualized the distribution of strain applied to the substrate.\nIn the context of strain sensors, being devices designed to measure externally applied stress, they operate in an environment where the components can be susceptible to damage through repetitive measurements. Consequently, there is a need for research aimed at enhancing the reliability of strain sensors to facilitate continuous sensing. Oh et al.\nintroduced a semiconductor thin film with self-healing properties, offering insights into addressing reliability issues in strain sensors . They employed a semiconductor thin film comprising a mixture of DPP-TVT-PDCA and PDMS-PDCA-Fe elastomer, determining through an examination of carrier mobility at various mixing ratios that the optimal ratio was 1:5. The self-healing properties of the proposed semiconductor thin film mixed with DPP-TVT-PDCA and PDMS-PDCA-Fe elastomer result from the presence of abundant dynamic metal–ligand coordination bonds . Finally, they fabricated a 5 × 5 strain sensor array and performed additional passivation to prevent device malfunction due to human sweat, showing that the electrical characteristics remained stable even after 15 h after dropping artificial sweat on the sensor array. After verifying the stability aspects, including the self-healing properties, they successfully visualized the distribution of strain by mapping the current of the sensors that make up the array when the center of the 5 × 5 strain sensor array was pierced with a plastic tip (Figure 7c–e).\nAs mentioned earlier, in order to improve the reliability and durability of the strain sensor, it is necessary to not only ensure stability to the semiconductor layer but also consider the stress in the interconnection between the components that make up the device.\nLi et al. investigated the stress distribution throughout the strain sensor through simulation when a horizontally increasing strain was applied to a resistive strain sensor consisting of an elastic sensitive region and two electrodes at both ends (Figure 7f) . A noticeable stress peak occurred at the interface between the elastic-sensitive region and the electrode, which means that in the strain sensor of the aforementioned structure, the junction between the electrode and the elastic-sensitive region is an unstable element with a high possibility of malfunction. Hence, they introduced an additional interconnected layer to mitigate stress at the contact area while preserving the strain sensing characteristics. Consequently, it was confirmed that the peak stress in the strain sensor was reduced by more than threefold\n(Figure 7g). Based on this, they introduced a CB-PDMS/Ecoflex interconnected layer into a strain sensor with Ag NW embedded in PDMS elastomer and Ag paste as the sensitive region and electrode, respectively, and secured stability at the contact area. Finally, by integrating a strain sensor into the flexible active-matrix OLED display, they could sense the distribution of strain according to the bending of the display and through this, implemented an interactive surface (Figure 7h).\nZhao et al. developed a multi-modal sensor capable of simultaneously detecting both strain and relative humidity . They applied and integrated graphene and MoS2 to sense strain and relative humidity, respectively. Even though the two sensing functions were performed simultaneously, mutual interference was avoided because graphene was insensitive to humidity and, conversely, MoS2 had a negligible response to humidity. They attached the proposed multimodal sensor to a mask to measure human breathing frequency, conducting measurements both before and after exercise. During this process, they could extract the breathing frequency by analyzing the cycle in which the peak of resistance changes for the measured strain and humidity occurred. Additionally, it was possible to observe changes in humidity attributed to exhalation. Consequently, while enhancing the performance of sensors such as sensitivity and response time is crucial, expanding the capability to sense multiple elements within the same area represents a direction for further advancement in the sensor field.\ninsensitive to humidity and, conversely, MoS2 had a negligible response to humidity.

Temperature Sensors\nHong et al. constructed a temperature sensor array based on a CNT TFT backplane . The temperature sensor array consists of a total of four layers, excluding Ecoflex, which is used as a flexible substrate. The CNT TFT and temperature sensor are positioned on the first and fourth layers, respectively, starting from the bottom\n(Figure 8a). The gate and source lines for array configuration are located on the second and third layers. Notably, the gate and source lines are constructed using Galinstan, ensuring that the electrical characteristics remain stable even when the Ecoflex board is deformed.\nMoreover, electrochemically synthesized polyaniline nanofiber film was employed as the temperature sensor channel and had a resistance sensitivity of 1.0% ◦C\n−1in the range from 15 to 45 ◦C (Figure 8b). Subsequently, following the integration of the temperature sensor with the CNT TFT, a linear change in current corresponding to temperature was observed (Figure 8c). This enabled the calculation of the temperature based on the change in drain current when a finger contacted the 5 × 5 temperature sensor array. Remarkably, the calculated temperature value closely matched the measurement obtained with an infrared thermometer.\nRen et al. implemented a temperature sensor array consisting of a DNTT TFT and a pentacene/Ag NPs thermistor in a 16 × 16 array (Figure 8d) . The constructed temperature sensor array demonstrated the ability to detect temperatures in the range of 20 to 100 ◦C, achieving a temperature resolution of 0.4 ◦C. In the case of the DNTT TFT,\nthe change in electrical characteristics in the relevant temperature range was negligible.\nInstead, only the resistance of the pentacene/Ag NPs thermistor exhibited a sensitive response to temperature. To validate the practicality of the temperature sensor, they placed a 2 cm × 2 cm Peltier heater on the sensor, inducing a temperature change. They successfully performed 2D temperature mapping using the temperature sensor array\n(Figure 8e). Moreover, by utilizing the flexible properties of poly(ethylene naphthalate)\n(PEN) used as a substrate, they demonstrated the measurement of body temperature by attaching the sensor to a person's forehead.\nThe two previous temperature sensor arrays were implemented by integrating a thermistor with a resistance change sensitive to temperature on a TFT-based backplane that is insensitive to temperature change. In addition, the focus was on implementing a temperature sensor and demonstrating the measurement of the temperature distribution of an object or body temperature. Furthermore, Kim et al. proposed a flexible temperature sensor array designed for low-power operation . To achieve a temperature sensor capable of low-power operation, they used a voltage range corresponding to the subthreshold region of the transistor because the subthreshold region is located near 0 V, which naturally leads to low power consumption. In addition, the characteristic that transport of carriers in the subthreshold region is mainly achieved by temperature-sensitive diffusion could serve as an opportunity to sense temperature at the subthreshold region. The implemented subthreshold transistor-based temperature sensor operated stably even under strain of up to 100%, and its sensitivity to temperature was recorded at a very high 9.4% ◦C\nAdditionally, they successfully measured the surface temperature of a cold or hot spherical metal ball using the proposed temperature sensor (Figure 8f–h).\n°C−1. Additionally, they successfully measured the surface temperature of a cold or hot \n![14_image_0.png](14_image_0.png) spherical metal ball using the proposed temperature sensor (Figure 8f–h).\n![14_image_1.png](14_image_1.png)\n5. **Summary** 5. Summary\nIn this review, we reported on studies that implemented an active-matrix array using TFTs based on emerging materials such as organic semiconductors, metal oxide semiconductors, 2D materials, and CNTs (Tables 1 and 2). The versatility of the TFT-based activematrix, which can overcome resolution limitations due to crosstalk issues in the passivematrix, became the reason for introducing the active-matrix not only in displays but also in various sensors. In addition, TFTs based on the bottom–up process offer a high degree of design flexibility, allowing for freedom in material and structure selection during In this review, we reported on studies that implemented an active-matrix array using TFTs based on emerging materials such as organic semiconductors, metal oxide semiconductors, 2D materials, and CNTs (Tables 1 and 2). The versatility of the TFT-based active-matrix, which can overcome resolution limitations due to crosstalk issues in the passive-matrix, became the reason for introducing the active-matrix not only in displays but also in various sensors. In addition, TFTs based on the bottom–up process offer a high degree of design flexibility, allowing for freedom in material and structure selection during production. The freedom of choice regarding design parameters allows TFTs to be manufactured not only on rigid substrates such as silicon and glass, but also on flexible substrates based on paper and polymers. As a result, many attempts have been reported to provide flexibility and stretchability to active-matrix-based displays and various sensors.\nIn particular, the flexible and stretchable sensor array produced allows for close contact with surfaces that are not flat, such as human skin. This is used in healthcare to measure biological signals by minimizing the gap between the sensor and the surface to which it is attached. It enables precise measurements in the monitoring system.\n| Application   | Transistor Materials   | Emission Materials      | Wavelength Band   | Quantum Efficiency   | Array Scale   | Ref.   |\n|---------------|------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|----------------------|---------------|--------|\n| LCD           | CNT                    | -                       | -                 | -                    | 5 × 5         |    |\n| micro-LED     | DNTT                   | micro-LED module        | White             | -                    | 8 × 8         |    |\n| micro-LED     | a-IGZO                 | GaN                     | 456 nm            | -                    | 384 × 128     |    |\n| OLED          | MoS2                   | Alq3/C545T              | -                 | -                    | 6 × 6         |    |\n| QDLED         | CNT                    | CdSe/CdxZn1−xSe/ZnS QDs | 609 nm            | 19.1%                | 5 × 5         |    |\n| OLEC          | PII2T                  | SY/ionic elastomer      | -                 | -                    | 5 × 5         |    |\n| Sensor Type   | Transistor Materials   | Sensor Materials      | Sensitivity           | |Operating Voltage|   | Array Scale   | Ref.   |\n|---------------|------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|---------------|--------|\n| Photo         | CNT                    | P3HT:PCBM             | 0.15 AW−1             | 5 V                   | 18 × 18       |    |\n| Photo         | In2O3                  | PTB7-Th/BTPV-4F       | 1393 AW−1             | 10 V                  | 16 × 16       |    |\n| Photo         | a-IGZO                 | CdS QD, CdSe QD       | 5.2 × 103 AW−1        | 15 V                  | 12 × 12       |    |\n| Photo         | DPP-DTT                | P3HT-IDTBR            | 0.356 AW−1            | 10 V                  | 10 × 10       |    |\n| Gas           | MoS2                   | MoS2                  | -                     | 10 V                  | 7 × 6         |    |\n| Pressure      | Graphene               | Graphene              | 2.05 × 10−4 kPa−1     | 30 V                  | 12 × 12       |    |\n| Pressure      | MoS2                   | MoS2                  | 0.045 Mpa−1           | 60 V                  | 20 × 20       |    |\n| Pressure      | CNT                    | MWCNTs/TPU composite  | 385 kPa−1             | 3 V                   | 64 × 64       |    |\n| Pressure      | DNTT                   | P(VDF:TrFE)           | 0.12 nC N−1           | 3 V                   | 12 × 12       |    |\n| Strain        | Graphene               | P(VDF:TrFE)           | Gauge factor (GF): 69 | 1 V                   | 4 × 4         |    |\n| Strain        | DPP-PDCA-PDMS          | DPP-PDCA-PDMS         | GF: 5.75 × 105        | 60 V                  | 5 × 5         |   |\n| Strain        | -                      | AgNWs                 | -                     | -                     | 4 × 9         |   |\n| Strain        | MoS2                   | Graphene              | GF: 412               | 5 V                   | 10 × 10       |   |\n| Temperature   | CNT                    | polyaniline nanofiber | 1.0% ◦C −1            | 10 V                  | 5 × 5         |   |\n| Temperature   | a-IGZO                 | Mxene                 | -                     | 4 V                   | 16 × 16       |   |\n| Temperature   | DPPT-TT                | DPPT-TT               | 9% ◦C −1              | 1 V                   | 5 × 5         |   |\nThere are many advantages to active-matrix using emerging-material-based TFTs, and the following matters need to be considered for further development to reach industrialization in the future. (i) Although it is important to improve the performance of TFTs based on emerging materials integrated into the active-matrix, it is necessary to secure reliability through continuous research and evaluation of operation stability that can maintain stable characteristics in various surrounding environments. (ii) In the case of active-matrix sensors, development is needed to detect two or more factors within the same area. This will be important in the development of gas sensors capable of detecting and identifying multiple gases, especially in the field of gas sensors that are less scalable to array scale. (iii) In addition, in order to advance to the industrialization stage, technology for manufacturing a high-resolution active-matrix array must be secured through improvements in the fine process level to improve the integration of TFTs based on emerging materials. As has been the case so far, the development of emerging-material-based TFT and active-matrix-based displays and sensors will continue to be implemented by many researchers, and it is clear that it will have a beneficial impact on our lives in the future.\nAuthor Contributions: S.K. performed literature research, analysis, and wrote the paper.

Details of these technological applications have been the subject of technical reviews, but the materials and specifically the metal oxide devices have not been coherent reviewed. This work brings together a wide range of information to present an overview of the history and development of metal oxide devices, from their earliest inception to the most recent advances. This begins with a discussion of the first developments of metal oxides and their applications, and the earliest realisations of metal oxide semiconducting devices and moves on to a discussion of the factors that need to be considered in designing metal oxide semiconducting devices, including; material choice, deposition methods and device structure. This is followed by an in-depth review of the effects of material defects and concludes with a review of the current state of applications based on metal oxide semiconductors.\n1 Introduction\nOver the past two decades there has been a rapid increase in the volume of technological applications that use metal oxide semiconductor-based devices. These applications include\nJoe Troughton received his MPhys\n(2013) and PhD (2019) degrees in Physics from the University of Durham. Joe's field of research is the relationship between nanoand micro-scale materials properties and the macro scale behaviour of devices. He is currently a postdoctoral researcher at Ecole des Mines de Saint-E´tienne where he is focusing on developing novel stretchable electronics for biomedical applications. Del Atkinson display technology and a variety of fast moving consumer goods\n(FMCGs). There are a number of technical reviews that cover these technologies in great detail,1–6 while the details of the oxide materials, devices concepts and the device details that form the underpinning basis of these technological solutions have not been coherently reviewed. This work aims to provide an accessible overview of these developments from their earliest inception and summarises the current status.\nRoberts Professor of Applied Physics at Durham University and is currently a Royal Society Industry Fellow. Professor Atkinson's research career includes academic and industrial posts and is currently focused on thin-film magnetic materials, spintronics, thin-film semiconductors for flexible electronics, and semiconducting nanowires and nanocomposites for device applications.\nHe has published over 100 research papers and has four patents granted. The focus of research is on understanding the relationship between physical structure and functional material properties in nanoscale structures for device applications, including memory and sensors.\nTo begin, transparent conductive metal oxides (TCOs) are introduced and the application of these TCOs in electronics is described. This is followed by a detailed review of the developments of metal oxide based thin-film transistors (TFTs), which includes key considerations in the choice of material, the materials deposition methods and the different structural forms developed for functional devices. After this, an in-depth discussion of the effects of material defects in devices, with a particular focus on amorphous indium gallium zinc oxide\n(IGZO), is presented. This details the origin and the effects of the key defect types, and the post-deposition treatments employed to minimise their impact on device functionality.\nThe review finishes with a survey of the current applications of a-IGZO, and related materials, devices including displays and flexible electronics applications.\n2 Transparent Metal Oxides\nOptically transparent metal oxides have a variety of applications in electronics and beyond. This section of the overview has a particular focus on dielectric and conductive materials in transparent and flexible applications, while the review of semiconducting applications is presented in the next section.\n2.1 Transparent Metal Oxides As Dielectric Materials\nOne of the most wide spread applications of metal oxides in electronics is as a dielectric material, particularly as the gate dielectric in transistors.\nIn conventional electronics, as the size of silicon transistors has reduced due to commercial pressure to produce ever higher functionality at lower costs, the thickness of the dielectric\n(traditionally SiO2) has reduced in line with other dimensions.7 However, as the thickness of the SiO2 continues to reduce, gate leakage (the current flow due to direct tunnelling of electrons through the film) has become a limiting factor, such that by the early 2000's, with SiO2 thicknesses less than 1.4 nm, the leakage current could reach 1 A cm2 at 1 V.8,9 This device scaling problem has driven the search for materials with higher dielectric constants, k, to replace SiO2.\nThese high-k dielectrics have been in many forms, most commonly metal oxides such as Ta2O3, 10 SrTiO3, 11 Al2O3, 7 and many others12–23 (see Fig. 1). As highlighted in Fig. 1, the dielectric constant is crudely inversely-proportional to the band gap of the material, requiring a balance between a high k and the large band gap required to ensure good insulating behaviour. A key feature to note is that, in addition to providing good electrical isolation between the gate electrode and semiconductor, the large band gap of these high-k dielectrics means they do not absorb light in the visible spectrum, making them optically transparent and therefore a suitable choice for transparent electronics.24 For a comprehensive review of the requirements, potential materials, and developments in high-k dielectrics see the review articles by Wilk et al.7 and Wang et al.24 Due to its large band gap (E8 eV) and reasonable dielectric constant (E9), Al2O3 has become one of the most common\nchoices for the gate dielectric material.24 Al2O3 is also advantageous due to the wide range of deposition techniques that can be used and the uniformity of important characteristics, such as dielectric constant and refractive index, particularly in the amorphous phase.25–31 For current device applications, Al2O3 is thus a good choice for the dielectric. However, due to the lower value of k than many other metal oxides, more recent work has sought to create multilayered dielectrics incorporating other, high-k, materials to further enhance device performance.27,32\n2.2 Transparent Metal Oxides As Transparent Electrodes\nThe second major application of transparent metal oxides in electronics is as a conductive component, known as transparent conductive oxides (TCOs), the main application of which is as electrodes, particularly for display applications.\nThe first report on TCOs came in 1907 with Badeker's discovery of the conductive properties of CdO, Cu2O, and PbO,34 although further developments of the field were limited throughout the first half of the 20th century by the limitations of the vacuum technology at the time. The thermal oxidation of a sputtered metal film, demonstrated by Badeker, was later used to produce tin oxide35 and indium oxide36 films, following which chemical deposition (in the form of pyrolysis) was developed for both.37–39 The same materials were later deposited by reactive sputtering of metal films in an Ar/O2 atmosphere, which was also used to produce iron oxide.40 The second half of the 20th century saw a proliferation of TCO applications such as in anti-static coatings, heat reflecting glass coatings, window heating elements, and many others,41,42 in addition to significant usage in electronics.\nThe overwhelming majority of electronics applications have used indium-tin-oxide (ITO), in part because it was one of the first TCOs to be developed in a controllable manner43–45 and also because the control of the film conductivity that was achieved by controlling level of Sn incorporation.46,47 Alongside the development of ITO, there has been work on SnO2 and ZnObased films, although the former has a significantly higher resistivity and the later has only recently achieved low resistivity values comparable with ITO.48 The main use of TCOs within electronics has been as electrodes in optical devices, initially as the front electrode in rectifying photocells49 and later as the gate electrode in flat panel displays (FPDs).50–53 ITO has also been used as both the gate electrode and source/drain electrodes in the fabrication of fully transparent TFTs,54,55 which are discussed further in Section 3. Details of the physical basis for simultaneous good\n'metallic' conductivity and 'non-metallic' transparency is well described in the review by Edwards et al.56 While there are advantages of using TCO electrodes, particularly in optoelectronic applications, there are also considerable limitations. One of the most apparent, and detrimental, is the resistivity of these TCOs. For all electrodes in a TFT the minimum possible resistivity (r) is desired, as this reduces voltage losses and signal noise. ITO and ZnO both have reported minimum resistivity of around 104 O cm,48 compared to commonly used thin metal films with resistivities in the range of 107 O cm o r o 105 O cm (for example r o 106 O cm for gold,57 r B 6  106 O cm for titanium,58,59 and r B 2  106 O cm for aluminium60 in typical thin film thicknesses at room temperature). ITO further presents cost challenges for manufacturing due to the increasing rarity of indium.41,61,62 Finally, as the field of thin-film electronics moves towards flexible applications, the use of ITO is limited as it fails quickly under strain.61,63 The choice of electrode material, therefore, is highly dependent on the specific application, with TCOs (still predominantly ITO) continuing in established FPD manufacturing, while new alternatives such as carbon nanotubes, graphene, and metallic grids stand to replace ITO when optical transparency is still required but cost and/or flexibility become concerns,41,61,64–67 while simple metal films (or bi- and tri-layer stacks of metals)\ncan be used where transparency is unnecessary and material and processing costs are dominant,68–70 discussed further in Section 3.2.4.\n3 Transparent Metal Oxides In Metal Oxide Thin-Film Transistors\nThe history of thin-film transistors (TFTs) actually pre-dates the now ubiquitous silicon transistor technology, at least in a theoretical sense. The first TFT designs were patented by Lilienfeld71–73 and Heil74 in the early 1930's, but due to the lack of understanding of either semiconductors or vacuum technology, these were purely concept patents with no demonstration of functionality. While these early designs where just concepts, they are very similar to modern designs, with Lilienfeld's first patent, granted in 1930, describing a metal–semiconductor field-effect transistor (MESFET) and another, in 1933, describing a metal-oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) of almost exactly the type seen today. It was not until the '60s, with significant advances in vacuum technology, that the first practical demonstration of TFTs was achieved by Weimer using polycrystalline cadmium sulphide\n(CdS) semiconductor with gold electrodes and a silicon monoxide\n80 The focus of this work was not on device performance, but rather on hysteresis effects for memory applications, so little electrical characterisation was included. It was not until 2003, with the work of Hoffman et al. on ZnO,81 that good electrical performance was shown for a metal oxide based TFT.\n3.1 Development Beyond Zno Tfts\nThe work of Hoffman et al., along with work from Carcia et al. and Masuda et al.82,83 marked the beginning of a new phase of research in metal oxide semiconductors and transparent electronics.\nZnO was known as a semiconducting oxide since the early\n'50s,84 but until the work of these groups, commercial application was limited to passive devices such as transparent conducting films, sensors, photocatalysts, and varistors.85 While the electronic performance achieved by Hoffman and Masuda was on a par with hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H)\nand organic TFTs at the time, in terms of carrier mobility\n(at m r 2.5 cm2 V1 s\n-1), ZnO was limited by the requirement for high processing temperatures, with devices exposed to process temperatures up to 600 1C. However, Carcia showed that similar performance could be achieved by depositing the ZnO using radio frequency (r.f.) sputtering at room temperature. Following this initial work on ZnO devices, many improvements in performance and variations in fabrication methods were reported,86–89 as well as work exploring SnO2 and In2O3 film and ZnO nanowires.90–94 These advances lead to demonstrations of ZnO replacing a-Si:H in flat panel displays\n(FPDs) for both active-matrix LCDs95,96 and AM-OLEDs.97,98 While devices based on binary semiconducting oxides (ZnO,\nSnO2, In2O3, etc.) showed good performance, there were limitations, in particular with the control of the threshold voltage\n(Vth), device stability, and performance uniformity. These problems are attributed to the high defect concentration within the oxide, leading to an excess of free electrons, and the presence of grain boundaries in the polycrystalline binary oxide materials.1 Some control of Vth was achieved by Lim et al.\nthrough doping the ZnO with nitrogen during deposition,99,100 however, the creation of grain-boundary free ZnO over large areas, either single crystal or amorphous, remains very challenging\nand ultimately leads to variations in device performance across the polycrystalline ZnO devices.\nIn an effort to mitigate these issues more complex oxides were proposed by Nomura et al. in 2003, particularly InGaO3(ZnO)5 (IGZO).101 Initially single crystal IGZO (sc-IGZO)\nwas produced that removed issues linked to grain boundaries and greatly reduced the density of defects, such that normallyoff TFTs (where there is no current flow at 0 V gate bias) were demonstrated.101 These devices showed excellent functional characteristics, with high mobility m = 80 cm2 V1 s\n-1, Vth = -3 V, and an on–off current ratio of 106. It was not, however, until the following year with work from the same group showing similar results using amorphous IGZO (a-IGZO),55 that IGZO became widely acknowledged as the leading material for next generation thin-film semiconductors. This work was particularly significant as it showed that good device characteristics, i.e. me E 8.3 cm2 V-1 s\n-1, Vth = 1.6 V, and on–off ratio E 103, could be achieved with processing at room temperature, enabling compatibility with the process constraints of flexible substrates. Additionally, it showed that the amorphous phase, which is stable up to around 500 1C in IGZO,102,103 was able to perform nearly as well as the single crystal phase while being significantly easier to produce.\nThe origin of the insensitivity of the electronic properties to the details of the material structure can be understood as follows: the movement of electrons in a crystalline material such as silicon can be visualised as travelling along the sp3 orbitals of the atoms, which overlap in the regular crystal structure, known as sp3 hybridisation (visualised in Fig. 2(a),\ntop). However, if the crystal structure is disrupted by defects, or the material is amorphous, this conduction pathway is broken\n(Fig. 2(a), bottom) leaving electrons to hop between orbitals in a process known as tail-state hopping.1 This dramatically reduces the mobility of the material. For example, in silicon the electron mobility in single crystal material can reach over 1000 cm2 V1 s 1, 104 but in the amorphous state this can drop to less than 0.05 cm2 V1 s\n105 In contrast, metal oxide semiconductors do not rely on the overlap of these sp3 orbitals to provide the conduction band pathway. Instead, the large s orbitals associated with the transition metal cations overlap to provide a conduction path, (Fig. 2(b)).55 As the s orbitals are spherically symmetrical, this overlap is the same whether the atoms are ordered in a regular crystal structure, or completely disordered in the amorphous form. Further details of the difference in transport mechanisms between traditional silicon and metal oxide semiconductors can be found in the review of the subject from Kamiya et al.1 The initial work from Nomura sparked a rush of publications on multicomponent oxides as the semiconductor component of TFTs. This research spanned both IGZO and many other combinations of cations with electron configuration (n - 1)d10ns0 (n Z 4),106 including Sn-doped ZnO (ZTO),107–111 In-Zn-oxide\n(IZO),112–115 and hafnium indium zinc oxide (HIZO).116–118 For further reviews of the development of the general field of metal oxide TFTs see the papers by Kamiya et al., Fortunato et al.,\nPark et al., and Petti et al.1,2,4,5\n3.2 The Growth Of Igzo Tfts\nSince the demonstration of IGZO by Nomura, many groups have contributed to the current understanding of these materials, both through the empirical study of devices, and through computational studies that use molecular dynamics and density functional theory.\nThe remainder of this section reviews the development of IGZO devices and the understanding of various issues surrounding device fabrication. While this section focuses primarily on IGZO, much of the discussion is directly applicable to other metal oxide devices.\n3.2.1 IGZO atomic composition. One area of interest for the development of IGZO has been the ionic composition of the material. The single crystal devices originally produced by Nomura et al., with the stoichiometry InGaO3(ZnO)5, were grown by reactive solid-phase epitaxy on to an yttria-stabilized zirconia substrate.101,119,120 The amorphous-IGZO demonstrated by the same group was deposited by pulsed laser deposition (PLD)\nfrom a polycrystalline InGaZnO4 target in an oxygen atmosphere and had a cation ratio, measured by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, of In : Ga : Zn = 1.1 : 1.1 : 0.9 (in atomic ratio).55 Systematic studies of the effect of material composition have been carried out by Hosono,121,122 Iwasaki et al.,\n123 and Barquinha et al.124 Hosono evaluated electron mobilities and concentrations through Hall effect measurements, as well as the crystalline nature of the materials, for various film compositions deposited on glass by PLD under oxygen partial pressure PO2 = 1 Pa. Fig. 3 shows tertiary composition maps of the amorphous formation regions, the\nBaraquinha's work, summarised in the review by Fortunato 2 and shown in Fig. 4, investigated IGZO deposited by r.f. sputtering loaded by University of Saskatchewan on 1/3/2020 1:35:\n27 September 2019. Downl.\nThe majority of the work on a-IGZO deposition (more than 90% of published papers up to 20122) has concentrated on sputtering. The main advantage of sputtering is the availability of tools and their compatibility with existing production-scale fabrication infrastructure, along with the capacity to deposit high quality films at, or near, room temperature.5 This continues to be the dominant method of deposition. However, in recent years, there has been a rise in alternative methods for depositing a-IGZO at lower costs and higher throughput, by eliminating the need for vacuum deposition. In most cases this has taken the form of solution processing methods such as spin coating, inkjet printing, or spray pyrolysis.137–140 There is also a growing body of work using spatial atomic layer deposition\n(S-ALD) that began in 2015 with work from Illiberi et al.141 and has expanded to several research groups in the last few years.142–145 While the possibility of depositing IGZO under atmospheric conditions is exciting, with potentially valuable applications in large area and roll-to-roll processing, it remains very much a developing area with significant challenges, and is partially reviewed in the recent work from Sheng et al.145 For solution processing routes these challenges are mostly in terms of the material properties, as solution processed a-IGZO has a significantly lower density than the sputtered material, which leads to reduced device performance in terms of carrier mobility, threshold control, and device stability (see Section 4 for discussion of the link between density, defects, and device performance). In contrast, the main drawback of S-ALD is the cost of the equipment, which is not compatible with existing fabrication facilities aimed at a-Si:H fabrication, and also the relative scarcity of precursor materials, both of which may become less problematic as this technique develops.\n3.2.3 TFT device structures for a-IGZO and other metal oxide TFTs. There are many possible device structures that have been investigated for metal-oxide TFTs. The most common structures are illustrated in Fig. 5. These configurations are typically categorised with respect to the position of the gate and source/drain electrodes relative to the oxide semiconductor and to each other.146 The general principle of all designs is the same - a semiconducting layer is patterned with two electrodes (the source and the drain) in direct contact with the semiconductor. A third electrode (the gate) is isolated from the semiconductor by a dielectric layer.2 This third electrode modulates the conductivity of the semiconductor by capacitive interjection of charge carriers close to the dielectric/semiconductor interface. This is known as the field effect and is the basis for all field effect transistors (FETs).147 The main device configurations fall under two naming conventions, the first based on the gate position relative to the semiconductor, i.e. top-gate or bottom-gate devices. The second is based on the source/drain position relative to the gate and the semiconductor, such that when the gate and the source/drain are the same side of the semiconductor layer it is termed a coplanar device, while if they are on opposite sides of the semiconductor layer this is called a staggered device structure.146 Structures optimised for epitaxial deposition. The first two device structures, (a) and (b), in Fig. 5 are perhaps the simplest designs and were the first to be studied. These designs have two advantages: first they require very few lithographic steps (just one in the case of Fig. 5(a)) making device production relatively cheap and quick. Secondly, the deposition of the semiconductor onto a flat, stable surface allows for epitaxial growth of single crystal material.101,119 The bottom-gate, top contact (BGTC) structure, sometimes referred to as staggered bottom-gate, shown in Fig. 5(a), is commonly used in research settings as commercially available Si wafers with a thermally grown SiO2 layer can be used as the gate electrode and gate insulator respectively, meaning device structures can be created with just a single patterning step.1 This design is, however, incompatible with commercial requirements due to the large overlap of the source/drain with the gate, causing high parasitic capacitance which acts to significantly reduce the switching speed of devices.\nBottom-gate TFT structures. Another disadvantage of device Fig. 5(a), that is common to all bottom-gated designs (Fig. 5(a),\n(c) and (e)), is the exposure of the semiconducting back-channel to environmental contaminants and/or damage during the source/drain definition process. The issue of back-channel exposure has been investigated by many groups. To prevent environmental contamination and the ingress of gases, devices can be encapsulated with a passivation layer, such as SiNx, SiOx, Al2O3, various polymers and even nano-cellulose material.4,116,148–154 Devices with such a passivation layer, but which do not protect the back-channel from the effects of source/drain etching during fabrication, are known as backchannel etch (BCE) devices. In order to protect the back-channel from the effects of etching during source/drain electrode definition, an additional layer, termed an etch-stopper (ES) can be introduced.\nThis allows for more accurate etching of the source/drain electrodes155 and enhanced device performance.4,156,157 While these bottom-gated structures require additional processing steps to create stable, high performance devices, they also have some major advantages. One advantage, which has increased the speed with which IGZO devices have been integrated into commercial products, is that existing display manufacturing using a-Si:H uses a BCE design making the transfer from a-Si:H\nto IGZO very easy.1,4 In addition IGZO is particularly prone to degradation in device characteristics when exposed to light,158–161 particularly UV light, as is the case when operating in display applications with a back-light (AM-LCD and some AMOLED displays for example149). In back-gated devices, where the gate is opaque to light the gate protects the channel region from the effects of the back-light, thereby reducing illumination bias stress effects (see Section 4.4.3162,163).\nTop-gate TFT structures. An alternative way of protecting the semiconducting material from environmental contamination is to fabricate the dielectric and the gate layers on top of the device in a top-gate configuration,4,55,128,164 as illustrated in Fig. 5(b), (d) and (f). This configuration reduces the number of fabricationsteps, while protecting the conduction channel.\nTwo further key advantages exist for top-gate designs: for devices exposed to light from the top, such as in typical OLED\ndisplays, the gate protects the channel from the deleterious light in the same way as discussed for the bottom-gated devices above.116,164,165 Furthermore, the use of a top-gate design allows for a self-aligned gate, defined by exposing the photoresist from the back side of the device (through transparent substrate and semiconductor layers) with the light masked by the source/drain to minimise parasitic capacitance and maximise device response speed.117,164,166–168 A final advantage of top-gated designs concerns epitaxial growth as discussed above. By depositing IGZO epitaxially on an inert substrate, crystalline material can be produced in both Fig. 5(a) and (b) structures. However, structure Fig. 5(a) requires a silicon substrate, making production of transparent devices impossible.\nConversely, by using a top-gated design with transparent electrodes\n(see Section 2.2), fully transparent devices can be produced, with reasonable performance thanks to the reduced overlap of the gate and source/drain electrodes.55,82,83,109,169 Coplanar vs. staggered contacts in TFTs. The second part of the device naming convention is concerned with the position of the source/drain contacts with regard to the semiconductor and the gate. Staggered structures have these contacts on the opposite side of the semiconductor to the gate, as in Fig. 5(b)–(d).\nA staggered structure with a bottom gate (also known as an inverted staggered structure) is the dominant architecture of a-Si:H devices used in commercial display manufacturing, and is therefore an attractive structure for the migration of IGZO into displays to replace a-Si:H. Conversely coplanar devices, with the contacts and the gate on the same side of the semiconductor, have advantages, including easier manufacture for crystalline devices grown epitaxially101 and lower contact resistance between the source/drain contacts and the semiconductor.170,171 Double-gated TFT structures. Some research has also investigated structures with gate electrodes both above and below the semiconductor layer, in a so-called double-gate structure, Fig. 5(g).172–174 This structure requires more processing steps due to the addition of an extra gate and dielectric layer, as well as necessitating a larger device footprint to accommodate the additional lithographic alignment tolerances and a more complex driving scheme.157 The benefit of these more complex device is in significantly improved device performance. This includes improvements in the field effect mobility, mFE, and reduction of the subthreshold swing SS, as reported Lim et al.,\nwho showed nearly a doubling of mFE and halving of SS,175 while device stability is improved,176 and there is a reduction in device noise177 owing to the change in field distribution within the channel. However despite these improvements, doublegate structures currently remain a research interest, with little development thus far towards commercial devices.\nVertical TFTs. The final device structure, depicted in Fig. 5(h),\nis the vertical TFT. This design has come to attention as the push for reduced device footprint has forced researchers to consider alternatives to planar geometries.5 Here the channel is defined by the thickness of a device layer, commonly an additional dielectric layer as in Fig. 5(h),143,178–181 although the channel can also be defined by the thickness of the gate or the semiconductor itself.182–185 This approach is currently very new and only a small amount of work on it exists.\n3.2.4 Electrode composition. In addition to the semiconductor composition, deposition method, and architecture, a significant effect on device performance comes from the electrode material, in particular the source/drain electrodes.\nThe choice of electrode material is determined by the application, with transparent metal oxides selected for flat panel displays, and while alternative transparent materials are being explored for other optoelectronic devices, and metal films are predominant where transparency is not required.\nThe primary consideration for the contact electrodes is then the contact resistance (Rcon) that arises from the interface between the source/drain electrodes and the semiconductor.\nThe total resistance (Rtot) between two contacts is the sum of this contact resistance and the resistance of the semiconductor, which is obtained from the sheet resistance of the semiconductor (Rsq). Resistance values can be extracted using transmission line measurements (TLM) in which contact pads of width W are deposited onto a sheet of semiconductor at varying distances (d), or directly from TFTs with variable channel lengths (d) and widths (W), following186\n$$R_{\\mathrm{tot}}=R_{\\mathrm{con}}+R_{\\mathrm{sq}}{\\frac{d}{W}}.$$\nHigh contact resistance degrades the device characteristics, particularly mFE and the operating frequency5,187,188 and therefore should be minimised. The contact resistance is dependent upon both the choice of electrode material and the nature of the interface between the electrode and the semiconductor.\nThe lowest contact resistances for a-IGZO devices have been achieved with metallic contacts. Early work from Shimura et al.\nshowed that a range of materials including Ag, In, Ti, ITO with a-IZO have contact resistances o10-4 O cm2.\n189 In the following decade there has been a focus on improving the contact resistance with multilayered materials, such as Ti/Au (Au on Ti),190 Ti/Al/Ti,128 AZO/Ag/AZO (aluminium doped ZnO with Ag),191 becoming common,192–195 while the inclusion of other materials, such as a thin films of carbon, either amorphous186 or graphene,196,197 has been reported.\nAs mentioned, the interface between the contact material and the semiconductor is important. Ti has often been included in contacts in order to promote good adhesion between the main contact metal and the a-IGZO, however, there is now evidence that the Ti acts to reduce the a-IGZO,\ncreating TiOx at the interface with metallised a-IGZO below, which leads to more Ohmic behaviour at the contact, improving device performance. This effect was clearly demonstrated by Choi and Kim, see Fig. 6198 and was the basis of recent studies that used other treatments to reduce the a-IGZO below the contacts, such as the inclusion of a thin layer of calcium199 or a helium plasma treatment.200 The source/drain contact is a very active and evolving areas of research for a-IGZO and metal oxide TFTs and the discussion above provides a snapshot of recent achievements, but it does not detail the emerging routes for creating transparent contacts, such as nanowires201,202 and micropatterned meshes,203 or the range of work on conductive transparent metal oxides that specifically addresses optoelectronic applications. For a detailed review of these areas see the excellent recent work from Naghdi et al.204 3.2.5 Buffer layer in TFTs. Where devices are fabricated with a top gate, particularly when using a polymer substrate for flexible applications, it is common to include a buffer layer between the substrate and the a-IGZO. This buffer layer helps create a smooth, stable platform onto which the a-IGZO is deposited, and is necessary as most flexible substrates have a high native roughness (polymer substrates typically have a surface roughness of around 50 nm to 500 nm depending on the preparation conditions, much higher than, for example, typical silicon wafer roughnesses of less than 1 nm). This buffer layer also acts as a barrier against the ingress of moisture and gases from the polymer and/or environment.199,205–208 While this buffer layer does not show any direct electrical behaviour, defects at the interface with the semiconductor can play a significant role in determining device characteristics, as described below in the discussions of defects. The inclusion and optimisation of such a buffer layer, often Al2O3, has been shown to significantly improve device characteristics, in particular negative bias stress (see Section 4.4.2).208,209\n4 Defects In A-Igzo And General Metal Oxide Tfts\nHaving detailed the development of amorphous metal oxide applications, and specifically that of a-IGZO TFTs, this review now turns to the understanding and control of defects in a-IGZO TFTs. This is broken down into a discussion of the major defect types, their effect on device performance, and the various measures reported to limit or harness these effects.\nSignificantly, while most defects are detrimental to device performance, some defects actually contribute to the high carrier density found in a-IGZO that makes it such a useful material. The topic of defects in a-IGZO TFTs has recently been well described by de Jamblinne de Meux.210\n4.1 Defects In The Channel Region\nThere are three main defect types present in the channel region\nof an a-IGZO TFT: oxygen vacancies, metal–metal bonds, and incorporated hydrogen.4 The effects of these on the static transfer characteristics are discussed here, while their effect on device stability is considered separately below.\n4.1.1 Oxygen vacancies. Oxygen vacancies (VO) are perhaps the most complex and impactful defects in the bulk channel.\nVacancies can form during deposition of the a-IGZO or through the removal of oxygen atoms post deposition. The oxygen content in a film is related to the level of oxygen vacancies, although it is not a direct measure as oxygen can also be included in the film as interstitial, i.e. an unbound species in an amorphous structure. The precise level of oxygen required to enable semiconducting behaviour in a-IGZO is not well characterised as reports of the oxygen content in films are limited (most works report the stoichiometry of the target and the O2 partial pressure during deposition). However, there are Fig. 6 Cross sectional high-resolution TEM image of a-IGZO TFT with Ti source/drain electrode with thin interfacial TiOx layer indicated.\nReproduced from Choi and Kim.198 indications that films with as little as 60% of the stoichiometric oxygen content can show semiconducting behaviour, although the behaviour is significantly poorer than the performance of material containing more oxygen.211 In the vicinity of an oxygen vacancy several local structures can arise, depicted in Fig. 7. These local features each have different effects on the electronic properties of the devices, particularly the density of sub-gap states within the density of states (DOS).\nWhere an oxygen vacancy is surrounded by a small number of cations, as in Fig. 7(a), or if the vacancy is next to a large free space void, as in Fig. 7(b), both deep and shallow electron traps are formed.212 These trap sites have a significant effect on the transfer characteristics of devices, and impact upon the operational stability (discussed separately below).\nAs the name suggests, these sites trap electrons (two electrons are trapped at an oxygen vacancy to create a neutral defect), reducing the carrier concentration and increasing the subthreshold swing (SS) while also contributing to hysteresis in the transfer characteristics. SS is directly related to the density of sub-gap trap sites according to1\n$${\\rm SS}=\\ln10\\cdot\\frac{k_{\\rm B}T}{q}\\biggl{(}1+\\frac{qD_{\\rm sg}}{C_{\\rm G}}\\biggr{)}[{\\rm meV\\ decade}^{-1}]\\tag{2}$$\nwhere kB is Boltzmann's constant, q is the elementary electron charge, CG is the gate dielectric capacitance and Dsg is the trap density, made up of trap states at the dielectric–semiconductor interface, Dit, and in the bulk channel, Nsg. Evaluated at 300 K\n$${\\bf S S}=59.5\\biggl(1+{\\frac{q D_{\\mathrm{sg}}}{C_{\\mathrm{G}}}}\\biggr)[\\mathrm{meV~decade}^{-1}]$$\n$$\\left({\\boldsymbol{3}}\\right)$$\nAs Nsg c Dit (around 5 orders of magnitude of difference have\nbeen reported1,213), defects in the channel bulk are effectively responsible for the magnitude of SS. Since SS is a measure of how much voltage is required to switch the device from off to on, a lower SS is desired to reduce the device operating voltage.214 The majority of defects that influence SS are deep within the band gap. Shallow trap states, around 0.1–0.3 eV\nbelow the valence band, contribute to hysteresis in device performance, as they trap electrons under positive gate bias, but release them under negative gate bias. Thus additional bias is needed to release these carriers before switching is observed.1,215,216 Alternatively, where a vacancy is surrounded by many cations, particularly where these form a dense edge-sharing network, a shallow donor level is created, Fig. 7(c). The shallow donor level is the main source of charge carriers in a-IGZO and is therefore vital for charge transport in devices.55,211,217 There are a variety of methods reported that aim to control the oxygen vacancies within a-IGZO. One such approach is controlling the level of vacancies in the material during deposition. This has been demonstrated in sputtered and pulsed laser deposited a-IGZO, where the increasing the partial pressure of oxygen is shown to decrease the level of VO, corresponding to a reduction in the carrier concentration.218–221 Post deposition annealing has also been shown to reduce VO by annealing either in a pure O2 atmosphere or in air.222–224 In such cases, care must be taken to prevent excess oxygen inclusion in the material, as this can degrade device performance.102 While most demonstrations of annealing have taken place at relatively high temperatures, low temperature annealing has also been shown to contribute to a reduction of VO.\n136,154 4.1.2 Metal–metal bonds. The presence of metal–metal bonds is associated with oxygen vacancy defects, in particular in oxygen-poor materials. These bonds form where there is insufficient oxygen, leaving under-coordinated metal ions that bond together to eliminate dangling bonds. These metal–metal bonds induce additional deep sub-gap states in the upper half of the band gap, below the conduction band minimum (CBM),225,226 with their exact position determined by the surrounding ionic environment. The ill-defined positions of these states leads to a wide distribution of observed states, and ultimately to tail-states extending throughout the band gap.227 The presence of extended tail-like states throughout the band gap can significantly increase leakage current in the off state, Ioff.\nReduction of the density of metal–metal bonds follows similar routes as for decreasing VO, because the metal–metal bonds are most commonly found in oxygen poor materials, so the prevention of metal–metal bonds during deposition and post deposition annealing can both be utilised. However, once metal–metal bonds are formed they are harder to eliminate than oxygen vacancies due to the energy required to break these bonds, so post deposition annealing requires higher energies\n(i.e. higher temperatures). The thermal budget for processing of flexible substrates is relatively low (as discussed later in this review) such that high temperatures cannot be used with flexible devices, so for flexibles it is preferable to deposit the material under optimised conditions.\n4.1.3 Hydrogen incorporation. The final major defect type that is common in the bulk of the channel layer is the incorporation of hydrogen. This can happen during deposition,228 with annealing under certain conditions,228–230 or via diffusion from the materials above and below the a-IGZO, i.e. the gate dielectric, etch stopper or passivation layer (in bottom gated devices), or, in some top-gated cases the buffer layer.\nThere has been much debate about the role of hydrogen within a-IGZO, but a general consensus has emerged over the last few years.207,231 The effect of hydrogen has two components that dominate at different H concentrations.\nAt lower concentrations, up to around 2  1021 cm-3 according to Han et al.,\n207 hydrogen in the film either bonds to weakly bound oxygen to create –OH groups232 or replaces oxygen at vacancy sites passivating the vacancy.207,233,234 By passivating these oxygen related defects, hydrogen improves device performance, giving lower subthreshold swing, reduced hysteresis (due to reduction in defect density) and increased carrier concentration.231,235 This last effect results from the fact that singly charged hydrogen states are stable, meaning the hydrogen acts as a shallow donor.231,233 At higher concentration levels, above 2  1021 cm3, hydrogen no longer improves device performance. Instead, the additional hydrogen creates a conductive channel near the dielectric interface that negatively shifts the turn-on voltage in proportion to the level of additional hydrogen.207 As hydrogen is a particularly mobile species it can be hard to control the levels of hydrogen in a film.\nWhile a consensus has started to emerge in recent years, a coherent overview of all mechanisms and potential treatments is still lacking. The field of a-IGZO (and more generally metal oxide TFTs) would benefit greatly from the publication of a comprehensive review of this topic.\n4.2 Defects In The Gate Dielectric\nThe gate dielectric itself can also host defects that have a significant effect on device performance. Specifically, where hydrogen is incorporated into the dielectric layer, such as in Al2O3, HfO2, SiNx, SiOx or any of the other gate dielectrics used, it acts as a charge trapping site.236–238 Similarly, any oxygen vacancies or under-coordinated species in the layer can act as deep or shallow trap sites, much as they do in SiO2 in traditional silicon electronics.239,240 These traps, for the most part, are quite shallow, such that they trap electrons under positive gate bias and release them during negative bias. This weak trapping has only a small impact on long term device performance, discussed below, it does contribute significantly to hysteresis in the device characteristics, because the trapped electrons act to shield the a-IGZO channel from the gate bias.241 Similar to the approaches to eliminate oxygen vacancies and metal–metal bonds in a-IGZO, attempts to reduce the defect density in the dielectric have taken two routes: optimisation of the deposited material and post-deposition annealing. By reducing the level of native defects through optimising the deposition process for the gate dielectric, much additional processing is eliminated. However, it has been shown that where nonoptimised deposition is necessary, annealing can significantly improve the device performance.242,243\n4.3 Defects At The Interface Between The Channel And The Surrounding Dielectrics\nFinally, the remaining locations of defects with significant impact on device performance are at the surface of the a-IGZO channel, at the interface between either the gate dielectric (the front channel) or the passivation/etch stopper/buffer layer (the back channel). Defects at these interfaces can occur for a variety of reasons, including diffusion of material at the interface (that may be the deposited material or unintentionally included species such as hydrogen), the native roughness of the material onto which the a-IGZO is deposited or damage from the deposition and patterning of subsequent materials following the a-IGZO deposition. These defects can act as trap sites, contributing to both hysteresis and device stability.\nWhere bottom-gate devices are concerned, the most effective route to reducing such defects is the inclusion of an etch stopper layer, which is now common practice,155,156,244,245 although care must be taken during deposition of the etch stopper as this may itself cause defects in the a-IGZO.246 For top-gate coplanar devices, where the contacts are deposited on top of the a-IGZO and the channel then defined through lithography, the etching of the contacts can cause significant damage to the interface247 so either an etchant that does not significantly etch a-IGZO, such as H2O2 should be used,174,247 or an off-set structure can be used as in the self-aligned coplanar structure of Fig. 5(i), for example that shown by Hong et al. in Fig. 8.248\n4.4 Device Stability\nThe issue of device stability is treated separately here for two\n![9_image_0.png](9_image_0.png) reasons; first, because it is an important issue with a significant volume of research focused upon it and secondly, because it is impacted by almost all types of defect.\nDevice stability here refers to how much the parameters characterising the quasi-static IV cycle (i.e. SS, Vth, Ion, Ioff, m)\nchange during or after some level of voltage stress. This stability is typically assessed by holding the gate electrode at the positive\n(for positive bias stress, PBS) or negative (for negative bias stress, NBS) extreme of the expected functional range of the device whilst holding the source electrode at ground and either applying a voltage equal to the gate voltage (for constant current measurements) to the drain electrode or holding it at ground. Biasing is then applied for various times under different environmental conditions that often includes light and/or temperature.\nThe significance of device stability stems from the need for devices to perform uniformly within defined tolerances and consistently over extended periods of time and many thousands of cycles. In display applications, small variation in device characteristics can cause obvious and immediate variation in the display output,249 while sensing applications rely on consistent operation of comparators with fixed Vth to make accurate measurements, and low power circuits, such as RFID\ntags require ''normally-off'' devices with a stable Vth 4 0 V, so that no power is wasted and to ensure proper modulation of the carrier signal.\n4.4.1 Positive bias stress. It has been shown, for almost all conditions that have been considered, that applying positive gate bias stress (PBS) causes a positive shift in the transfer curve for devices (DVth), but very little change in mobility (m) or subthreshold swing (SS),165,250–257 see for example Fig. 9(a)\nfrom Lee et al.165 In conventional a-Si TFTs PBS testing has identified two degradation mechanisms: defect creation in the channel and charge trapping in the dielectric or at the interface between the dielectric and the channel.258,259 Defect creation degrades both m and SS, while charge trapping causes a positive shift in Vth.\nAs PBS on a-IGZO devices only causes a shift in Vth, it has been concluded that only charge trapping occurs, with no additional defect creation.1,4,157 This charge trapping can occur at any of the trap sites discussed above, most significantly in the dielectric or at the interface between the dielectric and the a-IGZO. This process is almost identical to that which causes hysteresis between the forward and reverse transfer characteristics, i.e. the trap sites capture an electron, creating a negatively charged layer that shields the a-IGZO from the positive gate bias, which reduces the effective bias of the a-IGZO, so Vth increases. However, unlike with hysteresis, the electrons become tightly bound and remain stable at the defect sites even under negative gate bias.\nIn addition, it has been shown that recovery of the original Vth is possible after a relaxation period, as shown in Fig. 9(b). This recovery is hastened by elevated temperatures,1,2 but has been shown to occur even at room temperature.253,256 An additional contribution to PBS occurs in bottom gated devices with an exposed back channel, where ambient water and oxygen can be adsorbed/desorbed from the surface, which causes an additional shift in Vth, 214,260,261 although this can be effectively eliminated with the inclusion of a passivation layer.262,263 4.4.2 Negative bias stress. In contrast to positive bias, negative biasing of devices shows remarkably little effect on device characteristics when carried out in the dark.1,264,265 The small shifts that have been observed are similar to the PBS,\nwith no change in m or SS, and a small DVth o 1 V, with the original characteristics recovered after a short anneal. This is\n![10_image_0.png](10_image_0.png)\nexplained similarly to PBS, now with trapping of holes at defect sites causing a positive shielding effect and a subsequent lowering of Vth.\n157 As a-IGZO is an intrinsic n-type semiconductor, there is a very low density of holes native to the material and so little positive charge to trap, which limits DVth.\n4.4.3 Illumination bias stress. Many applications of a-IGZO\ninvolve illumination of devices. In display applications this comes either from the back light used in LCDs or from the pixels themselves in OLED displays, while in transparent, and many non-transparent circuits the light comes from the ambient environment.\nIt has been shown that such illumination has a negligible effect on PBS,266 but a significant effect on the negative bias stress, known as negative bias illumination stress (NBIS).\nFig. 10 shows a typical response to NBIS with (a) illumination wavelength, (b) stressing time with illumination at an energy less than the band gap, and (c) stressing time with illumination at an energy greater than the band gap. This figure\n![11_image_0.png](11_image_0.png)\nshows that NBIS causes two significant changes in the transfer characteristics: enhanced negative DVth and an increase in the off-current, Ioff. These results also show that the effects of NBIS\nare dependent on the wavelength of the illuminating light, with little change when the energy is significantly below the band gap of E3 eV, some enhancement in the negative shift with wavelengths near the band gap energy and a significant negative shift and increased Ioff for illumination above the band gap energy.\nThis has been explained with a hole-trapping model proposed by Lee et al.,\n267 in which illumination excites electrons from the valence band to subgap electron traps and the resulting holes are transported to trap sites at the dielectric–semiconductor interface.\nWhile this model explains the enhanced negative DVth, it does not explain the increase in Ioff. Kamiya et al. proposed a slightly different model in which electrons are promoted from deep-subgap states (such as those created by some oxygen vacancies and metal–metal bonds) to the conduction band.\nThis model explains both the shift in Vth, and the increased Ioff as there is a higher concentration of charge carriers in the conduction band even in the ''off'' state. These models are supported by the reported dependence of DVth on the thickness of the channel, where devices with a thicker channel show greater DVth due to an increase in the volume in which photoexcitations can occur.268 4.4.4 Control of mechanisms that lead to device instability.\nThe instability of device performance that results from the presence of defect sites can be improved in various ways. The reduction of defects in the dielectric and at the dielectric/\na-IGZO interface are clear routes to reducing instability effects, since fewer defects means fewer charge trap sites and therefore smaller shifts in Vth.\nFor the dielectric layer this is achieved by optimising the deposition process. For example, it has been shown that higher temperature (250 1C) ALD deposited dielectric produced more stable devices than identically fabricated devices with lower temperature (200 1C) ALD dielectric.269 As with routes to reducing VO and metal–metal bonds, the most effective method for reducing defects at the dielectric/a-IGZO\ninterface is post-deposition thermal annealing.270 This has been shown by many groups to reduce device instability, particularly NBIS,102,160,230,268 which is in part due to local relaxation that accommodates defects and partly due to diffusion of material at the interface that pacifies charge traps.271 It is significant to note that most of the annealing work demonstrating improvements in device stability involves temperatures at the top end or above the temperatures compatible with processing polymeric substrates.\n5 Metal Oxides For Tfts In Flexible Form Factors\nTruly flexible electronics has captured the imagination of the public for at least 60 years, with ideas of rollable, foldable displays and technology permeating science fiction and popular culture throughout the second half of the 20th century, back to The Mechanical Monarch by E. C. Tubb, published in 1958:272\n''Against one wall a wide sheet of clear material suddenly flared with light and swirling colour. It steadied and a woman stared from the screen.''\nThis was followed by other similar ideas, such as electronic newspapers and smart contact lenses, appearing over the following 40 years,273–276 becoming an absolute expectation in the science fiction of the 21st century. Academia and industry have been working towards the demonstration and realisation of this vision for many years, first by thinning down crystalline silicon (c-Si) chips and reducing their size to create flexibility\n(although the silicon itself remains rigid), followed by the introduction of truly flexible silicon in its amorphous (a-Si)277,278 and low-temperature polycrystalline (LTPS) forms,279,280 and then the revolution in organic electronics.281–283 While excellent electrical performance can be maintained with c-Si, true flexibility is not possible. Conversely, good flexibility is possible with both a-Si and organics, but the electronic functionality is poor in comparison to c-Si (mobilities of o1 cm2 V-1 s\n-1 are reported for a-Si and organics respectively5). LTPS does offer good performance in a flexible form, but the manufacturing costs and high processing temperatures make it an unattractive option for most flexible applications.\nFinally, thin-film metal oxides deposited on flexible substrates provide an effective route through which truly flexible, high performance low cost displays and wider electronic technologies can be enabled.\n5.1 Advantages Of Electronics On Flexible Substrates\nWhile the appeal of flexible displays for the general public is largely tied to the novelty of such technology, there are many practical advantages to migrating display, communication and sensing technologies on to flexible substrates.\nThe use of most flexible substrates greatly reduces the weight of devices, particularly displays which have traditionally been based around heavy, rigid glass and silicon, and for which there is a continuing drive for higher resolution and larger screens. This weight reduction improves handling, shipping, and production costs, and enables integration into a wide variety of products.\nFlexibility can also bring advantages in terms of product robustness, which stems from the ability of the circuits to reversibly deform under impact, meaning that device interconnects are not broken by small shear forces, such as induced by vibrations.\nHowever, flexible, particularly polymeric, substrates present difficulties for making robust interconnects between discrete components in the first place, particularly as the conventional methods of wire bonding may not be compatible due to the elevated temperatures required. Instead there is a great deal of work looking at the use of anisotropic conductive adhesives to make robust interconnects, which is covered in detail by Kim et al.284 for rigid-to-flexible bonding, although no review yet exists covering flex-to-flex bonding.\nA further advantage of flexible circuits is the opportunity to integrate electronic functionality into new form factors that are not accessible with traditional rigid circuits. These applications can include medical implants,285–288 intelligent packaging,289 wearable devices,290 and artificial skin,285,291 as well as flexible displays that can be rolled up into a very small size.292–298\n5.2 Materials For Flexible Substrates\nThere is a wide range of materials on which metal oxide TFTs can be fabricated, in principle the only limitation is the need for a relatively smooth (roughness o 100 nm at least), continuous area on which the devices can be fabricated. In practice, however, the vast majority of flexible substrates used are polymers, either free standing or laminated onto a glass carrier for ease of processing. The most commonly used polymers found in literature are polyimide (PI), polyethylene terephthalate\n(PET), and polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), although many others have been demonstrated. PET and PEN are attractive due to their very low cost, while having good chemical resistance, reasonable thermal stability below their glass transition temperature, Tg, and good transparency (both have cut-off wavelengths, lc in the ultraviolet). PI offers similar advantages in terms of chemical resistance and thermal stability, while having a significantly higher glass transition temperature (Tg = 300 1C for PI compared to 120 1C for PEN and 80 1C for PET). However, standard PI has an optical cut-off lc = 500 nm, making it appear yellow, although recent work has developed colourless PI (CPI).299,300 There have also been reports of TFTs fabricated on paper,301–303 thin metal foils,304–306 and ultra-thin flexible glass.307–309 While paper and metal foils are clearly not transparent, they do have benefits of low cost and high temperature processing capabilities respectively.310 Ultra-thin glass, on the other hand, offers both transparency and high processing temperature, along with increased mechanical protection for devices, but at a significantly higher cost and reduced flexibility\n(the maximum bending radius is 41 mm).\n5.3 Additional Considerations For Electronics On Flexible Substrates\nWhile there are significant advantages of flexible electronics, they give rise to additional challenges to device manufacturing. There are several additional considerations for fabricating devices on flexible substrates, the most obvious being the flexibility of the substrate itself.\nThe flexibility of the substrate may be an issue during production as it may be prone to movement during the manufacturing processes. This influences the accuracy of lithographic processes such that the design tolerances must be greater, increasing device footprint and therefore defect counts, the parasitic capacitance, and the overall circuit size. To minimise substrate motion it may be held under tension during lithography, but this introduces residual stress into the films deposited, which may lead to delamination or cracking in some layers. Alternatively, the substrate can be laminated onto a rigid carrier for fabrication, although this may lead to subsequent challenges with releasing the substrates from the carrier.\nA further issue with flexible substrates, particularly polymers, is that of differential thermal expansion with the added materials which may affect the film properties. PI is one of the most thermally stable polymers, with a coefficient of thermal expansion that is comparable to that of the materials used to make up the TFTs, making it a good choice to limit this effect.\nAnother significant effect of introducing flexibility is the impact on performance of devices with bending. This was recently reviewed by Heremans et al.311 who showed that for many candidate materials (particularly LTPS and organic semiconductors), bending has a major negative impact on the carrier mobility. However, for a-IGZO strikingly little variation with stress has been observed,312,313 demonstrated in Fig. 11 that shows the variation in threshold voltage, subthreshold swing, on current, and mobility with bending to a radius of 2 mm, showing that all parameters remain almost constant.\nThis insensitivity to bending is attributed to the same mechanism that gives rise to the good electronic characteristics that IGZO demonstrates, even in the amorphous form, i.e. conduction occurring through the overlap of the spherically symmetric s orbitals of the cations, discussed previously. This makes a-IGZO\nan excellent choice for flexible electronics, particularly in applications that may be expected to function in a flexed configuration, such as in packaging and curved displays.\n6 Applications Of A-Igzo And Other Metal Oxide Tfts\nThe remaining section of this review considers common applications of a-IGZO and other metal oxide TFTs. Current, and likely future, applications of such materials can be broadly split into two categories, namely, display technologies and low cost flexible circuits, which have predicted market values of around\n$49B and $7B respectively by 2020.314 Both applications are covered here, although the discussion of usage within display technologies is somewhat truncated, as several comprehensive reviews already exist.315–319\n6.1 Display Technology\nDisplay applications have been the driving force in metal oxide, and particularly a-IGZO, TFT development.5 Indeed, it took just one year from Nomura's demonstration of a-IGZO TFTs in 2004\n![13_image_0.png](13_image_0.png)\nfor the first demonstration of a display backplane (for black and white e-paper) based on a-IGZO TFTs by Toppan Printing Co. Ltd,126 which was shortly followed by a demonstration of an active matrix OLED (AM-OLED) display a year later by LG\nElectronics Inc.320,321 Many other companies have adopted a-IGZO, including Samsung,132,245 Hitachi,322 and AU Optronics Corp.,323 demonstrating progressively larger displays, as well as LCD back panels. Commercial production of a-IGZO based displays, by Sharp in 2012,324 commenced just 8 years after Nomura's initial work.\nAs discussed above, part of the appeal of a-IGZO for displays comes from the advantages afforded by flexible displays - light weight substrates, increased durability, and the popular appeal of a bendable display, which was considered from the very first demonstrations of a-IGZO.126 Beyond simply being flexible, a-IGZO outperforms other competitive materials because of it's transparency. As discussed previously, when deposited on to a suitable substrate a-IGZO, along with other metal oxide semiconductors, can be used to form fully transparent circuits.\nIn combination with suitable OLED display technology this creates the possibility for displays that are completely transparent in the off-state and become full displays when activated, see Fig. 12. Development to achieve this has recently taken a step forward with a slew of patents from Samsung that include both transparent and bendable mobile phones.325,326 As depicted in Fig. 12(a), a-IGZO also outperforms both a-Si and organic transistors in terms of the mobility and approaches that achieved with LTPS.327 This relatively high mobility allows devices with high operating frequencies, that are capable of driving high frame rate displays.\nWhile LTPS matches or beats a-IGZO in mobility and operating frequency, it requires higher processing temperature\n(4350 1C) and significantly reduced uniformity that make it an unsuitable choice for larger display screens. Organics semiconductors also suffer from a lack of areal uniformity that results from the solution based processing used to deposit them over large areas. Uniformity is particularly important in display applications because the output of a given OLED pixel is highly dependent on the driving TFT's characteristics. It has been reported that a variation in threshold voltage of just 0.1 V\ncan lead to up to a 20% variation in that OLED pixel's luminosity.249,328\n6.2 A-Igzo For Logic, Sensing And Communications\nAlongside the development of a-IGZO for display applications, work has been ongoing to develop a-IGZO and other metal oxides in applications such as logic circuits, sensing, power transmission, and wireless communication.5 The advantages of metal oxides in these areas are similar to those for display applications but for somewhat different reasons. For example, large area uniformity now enables large volumes of consistent device production rather than large area displays; transparency facilitates creation of non-visible circuitry for, for example, security applications; flexibility allows integration of devices into previously inaccessible form factors while increasing the mechanical durability of circuits; and the low cost of\n![14_image_1.png](14_image_1.png)\nproduction allows access to markets for which silicon-based devices are too expensive (such as fast moving consumer goods\n6.2.1 Logic circuits. The development of metal oxide circuitry started a few years after the rapid growth in metal oxide research in the years around 2000, with Presley et al.\ndemonstrating the first fully transparent circuits based on IGO\nin 2006.337 This circuit, similar to most early circuitry, comprised a ring oscillator made of an odd number of inverters (in this case 5), connected in series as in Fig. 13(b). Each inverter, in turn, comprises a control TFT and a load (either a second TFT or a resistor), see Fig. 13(a). The use of ring oscillators\n![14_image_0.png](14_image_0.png)\nallows the measurement of propagation delay, which is widely used as a benchmark for determining the maximum operating speed of a TFT.338 The initial work by Presley produced relatively poor results, with the 5 stage oscillator operating at 9.5 kHz, corresponding to a stage delay of 11 ms per stage, which was largely due to significant parasitic capacitance arising from the large source/drain to gate overlaps in the device structure.\nShortly after the demonstration from Presley, Ofuji et al.\ndemonstrated a similar system, this time using IGZO TFTs and significantly smaller overlaps, achieving 410 kHz, that equates to a propagation delay of 0.24 ms per stage, which is half that reported for a-Si:H339 and one third of that for organic TFTs.340 Since this early work, further improvements in speed have been obtained, circuit complexity has increased (for example shift registers341 and scan drivers342 have been demonstrated)\nand devices on flexible substrates have been produced that yield good performance. See for example the first demonstration of a five-stage ring oscillator on colourless PI from Hsieh et al.,\n343 showing an operating frequency of 182 kHz, equivalent to a stage delay of 0.55 ms per stage, at 20 V driving voltage, with a linear increase in frequency with voltage, Fig. 14, or work from Mativenga et al. showing high performance shift registers on PI which are still operational while rolled to a radius of just 4 mm, Fig. 15. These improvements have lead to demonstrations of full microprocessors, initially Fig. 12 (a) Materials for TFTs mapping the relationship between frequency capability and carrier mobility. Inset: Conceptual image of a transparent smart phone. (b) Conceptual illustration of future transparent and flexible systems where display elements, sensors, circuits, RF functionality, and energy devices are heterogeneously integrated using oxides and other thin film technologies, including silicon CMOS. Here, for better illustrative purposes, transparency is disregarded. (a and b) Reproduced from Lee et al.318 with data compiled from ref. 2, 55, 82, 319 and 329–335.\n(c) Image of a transparent PDA device featured in the film Iron Man 2.336\n![14_image_2.png](14_image_2.png)\nusing crystalline IGZO,344–346 and recently with an amorphous metal oxide on flexible substrates reported by PragmatIC Printing Ltd and ARM Holdings.347,348 6.2.2 Sensing applications of metal oxide semiconductors.\nAlongside the development of logic elements, many groups have looked at the application of metal oxide to sensing.5 Sensing capabilities are attractive as they open up possibilities within many more areas, including smart implants,350 artificial electronic skin,351 food safety,352 and temperature monitoring.353–355 These sensors are in the early stages of development, but show great promise in a research setting and are now being integrated into industrial production.\n![15_image_1.png](15_image_1.png)\n![15_image_0.png](15_image_0.png)\nMetal oxide sensors broadly operate along one of two lines:\neither multiple sensing and control gates are inductively coupled to the TFT gate, as in the work from Liu et al.,\n356 see Fig. 16, or a sensing surface (an externally coupled membrane,357 the TFT gate,355,358 or even the channel layer359–361)\ninteracts with the local environment, ad/absorbing gas or liquid molecules, creating a shift in potential or electrical characteristics of the TFT.\nAn alternative route to sensing applications takes the form of integrating metal oxide circuitry with existing analogue sensors. For this metal-oxide-based analogue-to-digital convertors (ADCs), comprising comparators and the surrounding logic need to be integrated with existing bio-sensors. Practical demonstrations of this have recently been shown,362,363 although widespread implementation has been limited by device variability, both between devices and as device performance changes due to stability issues. Such systems are particularly sensitive to variability as the comparators here compares an input signal to a reference voltage, and any variation in threshold characteristics are directly translated into a variable output of the devices. These applications highlight the need for truly stable and uniform devices.\n6.2.3 Energy harvesting. In order to leverage the low cost functionality made possible with a-IGZO technology, a power source is needed. In high value applications typically suited to silicon technology, this can be supplied by either a fixed supply or an integrated battery. This is, however, associated with high cost (both traditional coin cell batteries and next generation printed carbon batteries have a price floor one or two orders of magnitude greater than the cost per circuit for a-IGZO systems) and reduced flexibility (traditional batteries are rigid, while new printed batteries are much greater in size than the circuits being produced). This provides an opportunity for the supply of power via contactless transmission. Contactless power transmission can be realised with inductively coupled coils (source and receiver) and a rectifying circuit to convert AC input power into a usable DC supply. The receiving coil may be either a traditional metal coil, as commonly used in current RFID tags or, if transparency is desired, a TCO (typically ITO) although this comes at an efficiency cost. The rectifying circuit can be a diode or simply a TFT in a diode-load configuration (where the gate and drain are connected together).364 If a diode is used it may be one of several different forms.\nMost reminiscent of traditional silicon diodes is the p–n junction diode, in which a p- and an n-type semiconductor are in contact forming a p–n junction, for example NiO and IGZO as the p- and n-type materials respectively demonstrated by Mu¨nzenrieder et al.,\n365 as well as many other combinations.158,366,367 Alternatively, Schottky diodes with a metal–semiconductor junction are possible. However, due to the large electron affinity of most metal oxide semiconductors only a small Schottky barrier is possible,310 although Chasin et al. have successfully demonstrated Schottky diodes using a-IGZO with a Pd contact,368 as has Zhang et al. with an Al contact.369 Additionally, metal–\ninsulator–semiconductor (MIS),370 metal–insulator–metal\n(MIM)371 and self-switching diodes (SSD)372–374 have been demonstrated, but each has limitations that currently restrict them to academic interest rather than practical application.\nThe most efficient and most common arrangement for rectifying circuitry is the bridge rectifier shown in Fig. 17. This uses 4 diodes (or diode load configuration TFTs) to access both the positive and negative part of the AC waveform. Using this configuration with p–n diodes Mu¨nzenrieder et al. demonstrated a DC voltage of 2.1 V at an input frequency of 125 kHz with a peak-to-peak voltage (VPP) of 12 V365 and Chen et al. obtained 2.5 V up to 27 MHz with VPP = 8 V using Cu2O instead of NiO.375 Using Schottky diodes in the same configuration, Chasin et al. demonstrated the significant speed advantage inherent in Schottky devices, showing a DC voltage of 1.7 V for an input VPP of just 3 V up to 1.1 GHz.376 Using diode-loaded a-IGZO TFTs Kawamure et al. showed a DC voltage of 5 V for an input VPP of 20 V up to at least 25 MHz, demonstrating that diode-loaded a-IGZO TFTs are capable of rectifying at driving frequencies significantly above the threshold of 13.56 MHz required for RFID purposes, while operating at sufficiently high voltage to power a display.377 6.2.4 Data storage. Data storage is also needed to create a fully integrated, wholly a-IGZO-based, electronic system. Consequently, recent work has focused on non-volatile a-IGZO\nmemory. Suresh et al. and Zhang et al. both used charge storage in the dielectric to create multilevel memory. Suresh achieved this by doping a AlOx gate dielectric with Pt nano-particles, which showed charge retention of the order of a few hours,378 while Zhang demonstrated a double layer of IGZO separated by a thin Al2O3 charge tunnelling layer, with charge retention of around 1 day.379 Both systems essentially leverage the creation of charge trapping defects, discussed previously, to create hysteresis in the a-IGZO TFT behaviour, which is then used to store information.\nFerroelectric dielectric behaviour was utilised by van Breemen et al. for data storage (see Sections II and III of the review from Petti et al. for discussion of ferroelectric behaviours5) showing a 16  16 IGZO TFT array using ferroelectric P(VDF-TrFE) gate dielectric, with retention times up to 12 days.380 Memristors have also been considered as a route to achieve stable data storage, as demonstrated by Rosa et al.381 with solution processed a-IGZO, Fig. 18. Here conducting filaments were induced in the a-IGZO material during the writing phase, which were then disrupted during the reset phase. This system also showed data retention of the order of a few hours.\nIn addition to these and other emerging implementations of metal oxide memory, work is ongoing to create hybrid systems combining metal oxides with other existing technologies to meet memory requirements for many different applications.\nThese are not discussed here but are covered well in recent reviews by Wong (looking at metal-oxide resistive switching RAM (RRAM)),382 Zhao (looking at high-k dielectric non-volatile memory),383 Meena (looking at the general field of new nonvolatile memory technologies),384 and Sacchetto385 and Mladenov386 (looking at memristor technology).\n6.2.5 RFID/NFC communication. One of the most promising applications of a-IGZO outside of display technology is high volume, lost cost, and disposable wireless communications systems such as RFID/NFC tags.387 As well as the low cost, tags based on a-IGZO benefit from their flexibility, allowing integration in packaging, clothing, and in multiple different form factors, as well as the potential for being non-visible, allowing integration into windows, mirrors, and food packaging.5\n![16_image_0.png](16_image_0.png)\n![16_image_1.png](16_image_1.png)\nBuilding on earlier designs for organic RFID tags,388–390 Ozaki et al. first demonstrated a fully a-IGZO based RFID tag working at 13.56 MHz in 2011,387,391 which has now been replicated by many other research groups on both rigid and flexible substrates, including fully transparent versions.169,392,393 One remaining component of the RFID tag, not discussed above, is the load modulator.\nThis is simply an additional TFT placed directly in the DC power supply line, with the RFID code encoded to the gate voltage, see Fig. 19. By modulating the gate of this TFT with the code, the DC\nsupply is turned on and off, altering the power consumption of the tag and therefore the power harnessed by the tag's receiver coil. This modulation of the power consumption creates fluctuations in the electromagnetic field that can be interpreted by the RFID reader and decoded into the data to be transferred.\n7 Conclusions And Outlook\nThe aim of this review has been to provide an accessible overview of both the development of metal oxide electronics, in particular a-IGZO devices, and the variety of applications to which a-IGZO is now being applied. It is clear that a huge volume of research and development work has been undertaken on these systems over the past 15 years, with significant advances in understanding of the fundamental physics and materials science of metal oxides, and their potential in applications across a wide variety of sectors. Importantly, this work summarises the current understanding and limitations of many aspects of the key materials components that are required for metal-oxide-based devices, which, in turn, presents an opportunity to consider the outlook for future development directions and the challenges that need to be addressed to progress the field.\nWhile the main focus of this work on transparent metal oxides has been on the semiconducting behaviour and applications of metal oxides, there are also significant applications of metal-oxides as dielectrics and conductive components in transparent electronic devices. Insulating metal-oxides are commonly used as gate dielectrics and current applications are driving the need for higher dielectric constant materials.\nFuture developments would benefit for a better understanding\n![17_image_0.png](17_image_0.png)\nof the relationship between the band gap and dielectric constant of the metal-oxides and linking these with details of material growth and structure. Empirical control and tailoring of dielectric properties via the development of synthetic dielectrics by multilayering of different materials has also been demonstrated and offers a further pathway for future develops of transparent dielectrics. Transparent conductive metal-oxides, and specifically indium-tin-oxide (ITO), are widely used in applications as electrodes in device structures. The conductive properties of ITO\nare not ideal for applications and future developments need to look for more conductive alternative materials. With recent demonstrations of carbon-based and metallic grids as alternative conductive transparent layers, there are prospects for the development and integration of more conductive electrode materials into future devices, but the optical transparency must also be functionally competitive.\nOn the main topic of metal-oxide semiconductors for thin-film transistors, there has been extensive research and developments to understand the details of the physics of these materials, the deposition and processing of these materials, and the design and performance of device structures to create technologically relevant transistors. For amorphous metaloxides, InGaZnO has become established as the key functional semiconductor material for transistor applications. The electronic behaviour is now better understood and much work has focused on understanding and improving the semiconducting properties. The key materials issues identified for these metal-oxide materials relate to the presence of native and induced defects, both within the bulk and at interfaces with other layers, and future improvements in functional device performance will relate to deposition and processing to control these defect states.\nIn order to move on from the current position of these devices, it is expected that some of the more recent developments discussed will start to dominate the research world.\nIn particular the move away from costly high vacuum processing, such as sputtering, towards low cost, high volume atmospheric techniques such as solution-based processing and the recently developed spatial ALD, seems set to dominate as industrial players strive to realise the promised performance of a-IGZO at increasingly low cost points.\nDevice architectures for metal-oxide semiconductor transistors have evolved and developed for a variety of reasons. IGZO\nin particular is sensitive to degradation from visible light and UV exposure, and environmental contamination, and device structures have been developed in part to mitigate these problems.\nAnother area in which considerable effort is being invested is the development of complementary p-type metal oxide semiconductors. The development of a p-type oxide semiconductor with performance on a similar level to that of the n-type materials discussed here has been the goal of many groups, particularly looking at copper- and tin-based oxides, such as CuAlO2 394 and polycrystalline SnO.395 While this work has been on going for several years, progress to date has been slow.\nHowever, if this research does come to fruition it will facilitate a significant step forward for metal-oxide-based electronics, enabling the development of complementary logic systems, dramatically increasing speeds and reducing both power consumption and the number of transistors (and thereby device footprint) needed to achieve complex logic. For a comprehensive review of the state of p-type metal oxide semiconductors see the excellent review from Wang et al.396 In terms of applications, display technology is widely established and will continue to dominate applications of metaloxides for the foreseeable future, but wider applications in flexible electronics driven by developments of the ''internet-ofthings'' (IoT) are set to grow dramatically. In this regard lowcost high-volume RFID/NFC wireless device tags based on flexible IGZO electronic circuits are likely to become widespread as the costs and flexible form factor are compatible with integration into an increasingly wide range of consumer products.\nMany challenges remain for a-IGZO, and metal oxide semiconductors in general, particularly in relation to the control of defects and device stability, which must be over come before they can become widespread in technology. However, with the great wealth of understanding already achieved, and the wide field of players driving research forward, these materials look set to have a huge global impact over the coming decade and beyond. This includes on one hand upsetting the existing display applications market, with increased display size and resolution while reducing both cost and power consumption, as well as facilitating truly flexible displays. And on the other opening up entirely new markets including low cost integrated sensors, direct-to-consumer marketing through enhanced user interaction with fast moving consumer goods, and item level tracking throughout the entire product supply chain to improve both logistics and traceability.\nConflicts Of Interest\nThere are no conflicts to declare.\nThis work is supported through a Knowledge Transfer Partnership, funded by Innovate UK, and by PragmatIC Printing Ltd.\nNotes And References\n1 T.

Of Electronic Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul 04763, Korea Abstract\nThe amorphous indium-gallium-zinc oxide (a-IGZO) thin-film transistors (TFTs) have become the standard backplane technology for large-area active-matrix organic light-emitting diode (AMOLED) TV. The high-end mobile OLED demands the high mobility of ~100 cm2/Vs.

In this paper, we presented our recent efforts toward the high-performance and good reliability for IGZO TFTs, which is based on the atomic layer deposition process. First, the merits of the ALD-derived IGZO compared to sputtered IGZO in terms of the electrical performance of IGZO *TFT were* investigated.

Introduction\na-IGZO TFTs have been adapted in a standard backplane electronics for large-area AMOLED TV display. Their superb properties, such as high mobility (~10 cm2/Vs), low leakage current ( 1 pA), acceptable stability, low temperature process capability, large-area scalability, and relatively low-cost fabrication allow rapid commercialization of switching transistors and drivers in advanced display. On the other hand, the LTPS \nTFTs are a dominant backplane for mobile AMOLED display because of high mobility (~80 cm2/Vs) and excellent bias stability. Recently, LTPS is being replaced by hybrid-low temperature poly-silicon oxide (LTPO) technology, which consisted of LTPS and IGZO TFTs. Benefit of LTPO is a low panel power consumption because the channel material in a switching transistor can be replaced by IGZO with an ultra-lowleakage current. However, the LTPO technology has some demerits such as high fabrication cost and low yield due to its complicated structure and process step. In order to overcome these drawbacks, it is necessary to develop a high mobility oxide semiconductor which can be compete with the mobility of LTPS. Besides, the high mobility IGZO TFTs still enables the advanced OLED TVs with higher frame rate and super-high-resolution (\n8K) as shown in **Figure 1**. For this reason, the various approaches to improve the mobility of electron carriers in IGZO TFTs have been researched, such as optimization of cation composition,\napplication of stacked channel structure, and the lattice ordering-induced crystallization.\nIn this paper, we reported our recent efforts toward the highperformance and good reliability for IGZO TFTs, which is based \n![0_image_0.png](0_image_0.png) on the atomic layer deposition process. First, the novel difference of the ALD-derived IGZO compared to sputtered IGZO in terms of the electrical performance of IGZO TFT were analyzied in detail.\n For this purpose, we prepared the IGZO layers with comparable cation compositions and thermal budget from conventional sputtering and ALD methods. Second, the highperformance IGZO TFTs with heterojunction channel stacks was conceived, which resulted in the quantum confinement effect and corresponding boosting in terms of carrier mobility.\n Finally, the high-mobility, low-driving-voltage IGZO TFTs by adopting bilayer channel and hafnia-based gate dielectric stack were investigated.\nFigure 1.

Result And Discussion\nFirst approach is to develop the ALD-derived IGZO channel, which was compared to sputtered IGZO channel to clarify the unique merits of ALD process. **Figure 2** shows the transfer characteristics of the sputtered and ALD-derived IGZO TFTs. The cation composition of sputtered and ALD-derived IGZO are In0.48Ga0.38Zn0.14O and In0.50Ga0.34Zn0.16O, respectively, which are obtained by XRF analysis. The sputtered IGZO TFT exhibited the moderate field-effect mobility (FE), subthreshold gate swing \n(SS), threshold voltage (VTH) and ION/OFF ratio of 20.1  0.6 cm2/Vs, 0.49  0.07 V/dec, 0.52  0.13 V, and ~107, respectively, as shown in **Table 1**. The improvement in terms of FE (36.6  0.3 cm2/Vs) and SS (0.41  0.08 V/dec) were clearly observed in ALD-derived IGZO TFT. The mobility boosting by > 80 % for the ALD IGZO TFT was hardly explained by difference in the In fraction (~ 2 at%). To obtain an insight for the reason of mobility enhancement, the XRR and XPS analysis were carried out for sputtered and ALD-derived IGZO films. **Figure 3a** and 3b show the XRR data and O 1s spectra for sputtered and ALD-derived IGZO film, respectively. The O 1s peak was deconvoluted into three subpeaks which were assigned to the oxygen bonded to fully coordinated metal ions (M-O, 530.5 eV), oxygen bonded to the undercoordinated metal ions (VO, 531.1 eV), and impurity-related oxygen such as hydroxyl groups (O-H, 531.7 eV), respectively. \nThe ALD-derived IGZO film was found to have a higher mass \ndensity and lower VO ratio (5.60 g/cm3and 27 %) than those (5.49 g/cm3and 32 %) of the sputtered IGZO film. It would be attributed to the self-limited growth mechanism of the ALD process. The higher film density of the ALD-derived IGZO film is interpreted to be benefit because the relative predominance of shallow donor VO\n2+ to deep trap state VO leads to higher carrier density (Ne) and lower trap density,leading to higher FE and better SS in the ALD IGZO TFTs. Therefore, ALD-based oxide semiconductor TFTs are a promising alternative to the conventional sputtered IGZO TFTs.\nIGZO films with PDA 400C. (b) XRR data for the sputtered and ALD-derived IGZO films with varying PDA temperature. Data adapted from reference .\nSecond approach is the fabrication of IGZO TFT with heterojunction channel structure. The IGZO heterojunction channel with 10-nm-thick IGO layer (Eg opt =3.68 eV, confinement layer) and 3-nm-thick ZnO layer (Eg opt =3.98 eV, barrier layer) \nwas designed, which can induce a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) system to boost the field-effect mobility of the resulting IGZO TFTs. The energy band diagram of IGO/ZnO heterojunction stack was shown in **Figure 4**. The energy band structure was drawn by considering an optical bandgap (Eg opt), \nwork-function, and position of fermi energy level from valence band maximum (EF  EVBM), which was obtained from ellipsometry and UPS analyses. It can be inferred that electrons transfer from ZnO to IGO due to their difference of workfunction, causing the accumulation of free carriers near IGO/ZnO \nheterointerface. These free carriers can be effectively confined by ZnO layer. The formation of 2DEG system is believed to induce the considerable enhancement in the FE for the IGO/ZnO \nheterojunction TFT. It was confirmed in comparison of device characteristics between IGO single channel and IGO/ZnO heterojunction channel TFTs. **Figure 5a** and 5b shows the representative transfer characteristics of IGO and IGO/ZnO TFT and their corresponding electrical parameters were shown in Table 2. The IGO single channel TFT exhibited a FE, SS, VTH, \nand I*ON/OFF* ratio of 41.7  1.43 cm2/Vs, 0.44  0.07 V/dec, -1.55 0.71 V, and 1  108, respectively. Interestingly, the electrical performance of IGO/ZnO heterojunction TFT was significantly improved to 63.2  0.26 cm2/Vs, 0.26  0.03 V/dec, -0.84  0.85 V, and 9  108, respectively. Furthermore, it had superior PBS\n(+0.58 V) and NBS (-0.39V) stabilities compared to those of IGO single channel TFT (+1.96 and -1.99 V for PBS and NBS, respectively). The plausible reason is that the ultrathin ZnO layer on the IGO layer can act as suppressor to create VO defects. The fermi energy level of IGO is elevated by electron transfer from ZnO layer and it makes difficult to create the VO by increasing the formation energy of VO. This kind of phenomenon is well known in ZnO. From this result, adopting the heterojunction concept into ALD-derived oxide semiconductor system can be a powerful strategy to enhance the carrier transporting properties and improve the bias stability in the resulting TFTs.\n| and IGO/ZnO heterojunction TFT.

The effect of high- dielectric as a gate insulator of IGZO TFTs were examined. We expect the improvement in two aspects: 1) mobility boost by facilitating the percolation conduction pathway and 2) driving voltage range decrease by the strong capacitive coupling. \nA HfO2 dielectric ( = 21) with various thickness (TOX) from 100 to 50 nm was used as a gate insulator on IGZO TFT. The representative transfer characteristics of IGZO TFT with 100 and 50 nm HfO2 gate insulator were shown in **Figure 6b** and 6c, respectively. All IGZO channel used in this experiments had a same cation composition of In0.52Ga0.29Zn0.19O (referred as a baselayer hereafter) for comparison of COX change effect (see **Figure** \n6a). As decreasing TOX (increasing COX), the FE was increased which is reminiscent of percolation conduction mechanism (see Figure 6e). It can be attributed that higher COX can produce a larger carrier density (Ne) in IGZO channel at the identical VGS, which can help elevating of quasi EF by reducing the effective height of energy barrier. Also, the SS value was reduced due to the better gate efficiency, which should be advisable for lowvoltage driving. These results suggest the benefit of adopting high-k dielectric as a gate insulator for IGZO TFT. However, the non-negligible I-V hysteresis was founded in IGZO TFTs with HfO2 gate insulator, which can be inferred to serious temporal trapping in IGZO/HfO2 interface. In order to diminish this hysteresis, we investigated the IGZO TFT with 50 nm Al2O3 gate insulator. It was shown hysteresis-free I-V characteristic as shown in **Figure 6d**. This suggests that Al2O3 layer has better interface matching with IGZO channel layer than that for HfO2 layer. The difference of NT,max value between IGZO TFT with Al2O3 (2.69 1018 cm-3eV-1) and HfO2 (3.94  1018 cm-3eV-1) can support this assumption. This property will be used in IGZO TFT with bilayer channel structure as discussed below. **Figure 7** shows the representative transfer characteristics of bilayer IGZO TFT with HfO2 (50 nm) and Al2O3 (4 nm)/HfO2 (50 nm) stack and their schematic diagram of TFT structure. The bilayer channel structure, which is consisting of 3-nm-thick In-rich boost-layer (In0.82Ga0.08Zn0.10O, acting as a mobility booster) and 10-nm-thick In-less base-layer (In0.52Ga0.29Zn0.19O, acting as a stability enhancer), was adopted in order to satisfy both high mobility and good stability. The bilayer IGZO TFT with 50 nm HfO2 gate insulator exhibited great electrical performance with a high FE of 70.5  1.07 cm2/Vs, a low SS of 0.17  0.02 V/dec, and a modest VTH of -0.25  0.28 V. Its FE was >3-fold higher than that of base-layer IGZO TFT with 50 nm HfO2 (21.7  0.80 cm2/Vs). \nAlso, other electrical parameters, such as SS (0.13  0.02 V/dec) and VTH (1.18  0.23 V), were comparable. This enhancement phenomenon can be attributed to synergic effect of bilayer IGZO channel, which can be explained by the effective formation of percolation pathway in boost-layer due to its high In concentration and low VO density in base-layer due to its modest In and Ga concentration. However, the device still suffered from clockwise operation hysteresis due to the poor interface matching between IGZO and HfO2 layer. In order to mitigate this problem, a 4 nm Al2O3 layer was inserted between IGZO and HfO2 as an interface stabilizer. The bilayer IGZO TFT with 4 nm Al2O3/50 nm HfO2 stack exhibited hysteresis-free I-V characteristic with a FE of 74.0  0.91 cm2/Vs, a SS of 0.13  0.01 V/dec, a VTH of 0.20 0.24 V., and low driving voltage of < 2 V. This performance of device corresponds to the state-of-the-art in any kind of metal oxide TFTs reported in the literature. Therefore, we suggested that the ALD-based oxide semiconductor system and high-k dielectric gate insulator could be effective strategy to enhance the carriertransporting properties and improve the PBTS and NBIS stability in the resulting TFTs.\nTable. 3.

Conclusion\nThree different approaches were attempted to enhance the carrier mobility of IGZO TFTs on basis of ALD process. First, the ALDderived IGZO had advantage in terms of FE and SS. This can be attributed to the difference of local coordination structure of VO defects. Second, the heterojunction concept of IGO/ZnO channel through ALD process exhibited remarkably improvement of device characteristics, which can be attributed to the formation of 2DEG system near IGO/ZnO heterointerface. Finally, we demonstrated the IGZO TFT with high mobility and low-driving voltage by adopting bilayer channel structure and HfO2-based dielectric stack. Therefore, the ALD-based oxide semiconductor system can be an powerful strategy for using high-end display applications.\n4.

The I-V characteristics of the transistors were measured on a semiconductor parameter analyzer, Keithley 4200, and the C-V measurements were carried out on an LCR\nAPPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS 92, 033502 2008-\nOver the past few years, great progress has been made in the field of thin film transistors TFTs- using a wide variety of different channel materials. When examining the requirements for large area deposition and mechanical stability when placed on flexible substrates, amorphous oxide semiconductors AOSs- appear especially promising.1,2 Compared to traditional amorphous semiconductors such as a-Si and organic thin film transistor materials, AOS\nbased TFTs have clearly superior electron mobilities.3 Transistors with good characteristics with 1 - 2 V threshold voltages, current on/off ratios of 107 - 108, electron mobilities being 10– 50 cm2 V−1 s−1, and subthreshold slopes of 0.1– 0.2 V decade−1 have been reported.3–5 However, for applications, it is necessary to understand how these devices behave under bias stress.\nIt is well established for a-Si and other thin film transistor materials/devices that prolonged application of gate bias on the TFTs can result in the deterioration of the currentvoltage characteristics. This effect could be manifested as a change in the field effect mobility, a change in the subthreshold slope, or as a shift in threshold voltage.6–8 This is commonly referred to as the bias stress effect and has been observed in a-Si:H,9 poly-Si,10 and several organic TFTs.11–13 In the literature, several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the bias stress effect.9,13 Though AOS based TFTs have been extensively studied by various groups, very few experimental work has been reported on the bias stress effect on AOS TFTs.14,15 In this paper, we focus on indium gallium zinc oxide IGZO- channel TFTs that are amorphous, and deposited at room temperature and fabricated without any annealing or material passivation steps, and report the results of bias stress measurements. This study reveals that the effects of a constant gate bias stress and the resulting shifts in threshold voltage can be explained using a simple charge trapping model. This indicates that IGZO is robust as a channel material and that with the appropriate choice of the gate dielectric, where the interface trap density can be controlled, TFTs that are transparent in the visible spectrum should find numerous applications.\nTransparent IGZO In2O3 :Ga2O3 :ZnO\n= 1: 1: 10 mol %- TFTs were fabricated using a bottom gated 11 June 2024 06:30:22\napplication of gate bias stress. The phenomenon of a positive threshold voltage shift with an applied positive gate bias results from negative charge being trapped at the channel/\ndielectric interface or getting injected into the gate dielectric.\nThe positive threshold voltage shift is then explained by the negative charge screening the applied gate voltage. The lower effective gate bias results in a smaller current flowing through the channel, thus a larger positive voltage is required for the device to turn on and reach saturation.\nFigure 2 shows the room temperature dc C-V measurement of the ITO/ATO/IGZO/ITO capacitor structure. The capacitor was subjected to three back-to-back hysteresis loop sweeps V G =–10 to 10, –20 to 20, and –30 to 30 V. From Fig. 2 , we observe that the flat band voltage V FB shifts successively to more positive voltage for each hysteresis loop during the return sweep. This is additional evidence that negative carriers are trapped at the channel/dielectric interface or injected into the dielectric from the IGZO channel.\nAlso note that the forward sweeps of curves, −20 to 20 and −30 to 30 V, fall on the previous curve reverse sweeps (i.e.,\n−10 to 10 V and −20 to 20 V, respectively). This indicates that when a negative bias is applied to the gate, no positive charges are injected from the IGZO channel into the gate dielectric and the capacitor maintains its characteristics from the positive part of the previous hysteresis loop. The slope of the curves in the transition region from accumulation to depletion is the same as that from depletion to accumulation, indicating that the bias stress does not change the trap density at the channel/dielectric interface.\nThis was further verified by applying negative voltages as a bias stress. Figure 3 compares two TFTs: one having\nbeen subjected to a positive gate bias stress, while the other undergoes a negative gate bias stress. It can be seen that, as expected, the positive bias stress causes a positive threshold voltage shift AV th , where AV th =V th (t) –V th (t =O), while the negative gate bias stress does not change the threshold voltage, and the transfer curve of the stressed TFT overlaps that of the unstressed TFT.  This is an indication that when a negative bias is applied to the gate, the transistor channel is depleted of electrons at the channel/dielectric interface and no mobile charges are available for the charge trapping and tunneling process.\nThe dependence of the threshold voltage shift on the duration of the applied gate bias is plotted in Fig. 4 for different gate stress voltages. From the plot, a linear relationship between ∆ V th and logarithmic time can be seen. The 2500 NSOS annul\n![2_image_3.png](2_image_3.png) ![2_image_4.png](2_image_4.png)\ninset shows that this model is predictive of the voltage threshold shift for long stress durations of up to 24 h. This dependence is indicative of charge trapping phenomenon.15 The relationship can be modeled by quantifying the total charge that get trapped at the channel/dielectric interface or in the dielectric for any given time t. Given the material parameters work function, capacitance, etc.- are invariant during biasing, the Vth can be expressed as Vtht- = Qt-/Cox, 1where Qt- is the total charge trapped and Cox is the capacitance per unit area of the gate dielectric. By assuming a uniform distribution of traps in the dielectric, an expression for the total trapped charge is obtained by integrating over time and thickness of the gate dielectric in which traps are present,16\n$$Q(t)=\\int_{0}^{t}d t^{\\prime}\\int_{0}^{x}d x^{\\prime}N_{\\mathrm{tr}}\\varpi(x^{\\prime})\\mathrm{exp}[-\\varpi(x^{\\prime})t^{\\prime}],$$\nwhere Ntr is the density of traps in the dielectric and x-\n=0 exp−x/- is the time independent tunneling probability, where the tunneling constant  is the product of the applied gate voltage and dielectric material parameters. The solution of the above equation leads to the Vth expression given below,\n$$\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{th}}=r_{0}\\log\\!\\left({\\frac{t}{t_{0}}}\\right)\\!,$$\nwhere r0 is a decay rate constant which is proportional to the product of Ntr cm−3- and  cm-. Since  is dependent on the applied gate voltage, higher bias stresses will result in more charge trapping, larger decay rate constants, and larger voltage shifts.\nOne way to reduce the threshold voltage shift during bias stressing would be to reduce the mobile carriers in the channel. Films grown at a higher oxygen partial pressure tend to have lower carrier concentration.17 The effect of IGZO growth conditions on Vth is also shown in Fig. 4. We can clearly see that the TFT fabricated with a 40 mTorr channel is less sensitive to gate bias stress with lower threshold voltage shifts. Varying the oxygen partial pressure during deposition of the channel slightly changes the composition of the film.17 This requires more investigation, but it could affect the channel/dielectric interface by changing the density of the interface states resulting in a reduction in the threshold voltage shifts. In general, the decay rate constant appears to be a strong function of the applied gate bias.\nAnnealing the IGZO films at temperatures as low as 200 °C in atmosphere for a few minutes leads to a drop in the carrier concentration.17 The highest temperature the as fabricated transistors were exposed to during processing is a 95 °C photoresist bake step. To investigate the effect of postdeposition annealing, TFTs fabricated with a 25 mTorr channel were annealed at 200 °C for 10 min in atmosphere. Bias stress data were measured before and after the annealing and plotted in Fig. 4. It was found that the Vth reduced from 4.6 to 3 V for a bias stress of 30 V and duration of 1000 s.\nThis suggests that improvements in the channel/dielectric interface can be obtained, via reduction in charge trapping defects, with some improvement also resulting from a reduction in carrier concentration.\n$$({\\mathfrak{I}})$$\nIn conclusion, we have investigated the effects of bias stress on IGZO thin film transistors. A threshold voltage shift Vth- was observed as a result of bias stress, and this shift was quantified as a function of bias stress voltage and duration. Both I-V and C-V measurements were used to determine that the voltage instability arises due to the process of charge trapping in the channel/dielectric interface or in the dielectric due to bias stressing.\nLett. 84, 3184 2004-. 13J.

A 352ppi printed organic-light-emitting diode display demonstrated the technology's practicality.\nOxide TFT; OLED; high resolution; integrated gate driver \n1. Objective And Background\nOxide thin film transistors (TFT) have become popular as backplanes for organic-light-emitting diode (OLED) displays as a result of their remarkable technological development. To meet recent demands for high resolution and narrow bezel displays, various studies have been performed to improve both channel dimension scalability  and reliability . To design a highresolution pixel circuit within a limited area, it is necessary to realize a short-channel device to reduce the TFT size. \nAdditionally, to design an integrated gate driver circuit, it is necessary to realize a wide-channel TFT to obtain high driving ability. High reliability comparable to that of low-temperature polysilicon TFTs is also required to drive the OLED display and the integrated gate driver. \nIn this paper, we report channel-dimension-scalable oxide TFT technology. The short-channel device was realized using a combination of a self-aligned structure formed by AlO sputtering and a shield connected to the source electrode. The wide-channel device was realized by AlO passivation, which provided a uniform carrier distribution along the channel width direction. High reliability was achieved by hydrogen passivation and hydrogen doping using an undercoat to deactivate the trap centers in the oxide semiconductor. We demonstrated a 352-ppi printed OLED \ndisplay driven by the integrated gate driver. Both high storage reliability and high display operation reliability were confirmed. \n2. TFT Structure and Fabrication Process Figure 1 shows a schematic of the cross-section of the developed oxide TFT. A passivation structure composed of AlO/SiO/AlO layers was introduced below the organic interlayer in the top-gate structure. A lower AlO layer was introduced to form self-aligned source/drain regions from an oxygen-deficient conductive oxide layer. The conductive oxide maintains low resistivity during device fabrication because of the oxygen barrier property of the AlO layer. The source/drain formation process by AlO sputtering is described in detail elsewhere . A SiO layer was introduced on the lower AlO layer to ensure the processability of the upper AlO layer during the contact hole formation process. In general, thick AlO films are considered to provide high impurity barrier performances against contaminant species such as hydrogen, oxygen and water. However, thick AlO films also require long over-etching times because of their low etch rates. As a result, over-etching damage occurs to the layer below the thick \nSiO Layer Source **Drain**\nUpper AlO Layer Undercoat **Shield**\nOrganic Interlayer Lower AlO Layer Oxide(Conductive) **Oxide(Semiconductor)**\nAlO layer. In the developed passivation structure, the SiO layer below the upper AlO layer acts as an etch-stop layer. Because this enables the processability of the upper AlO layer on the SiO layer, the upper AlO layer thickness can be increased. Consequently, the thick AlO layer provides excellent impurity barrier performance. The shield connected to the source electrode was introduced to fix the back channel potential and prevent threshold voltage changes being caused by the surrounding electric field . The undercoat was introduced not only to form the shield structure, but also to improve reliability as a source of hydrogen passivation and hydrogen dopants. \nThe device fabrication process is described as follows. First, a Mo shield layer for driving TFT in the pixel circuit was formed on the substrate. Then, an undercoat composed of SiO/SiN was deposited. Subsequently, an InGaZnO (IGZO) isolated oxide film was formed and annealed. Then, a SiO gate insulator layer was deposited on the oxide film. Next, a Ti/Al/Ti gate metal structure for the gate electrode was sputtered on the gate insulator. After top-gate structure formation by continuous etching of the gate metal and gate insulator layers, a lower AlO layer was deposited for self-aligned source/drain formation. The SiO and upper AlO passivation layer was then formed and an organic insulator was coated and patterned to form an interlayer structure. A contact hole was then formed in the passivation to connect the conductive oxide region to the source/drain electrodes. Finally, a Ti/Al/Ti source/drain electrode structure was formed. \n3. Short-Channel Tft For High-Resolution Pixel\nSerious negative threshold voltage shifts occur in shortchannel TFTs because of carrier diffusion from the source/drain regions to the channel region in coplanar homojunction oxide TFTs . To confirm the expansion of the source/drain regions, the channel length difference ΔL **between the gate-metal-defined** \nchannel length L and the effective channel length Leff **is often** \nevaluated using the channel resistance method . Some researchers have reported that the self-aligned source/drain region, which consists of hydrogenated oxide semiconductor, showed ΔL=**1.5 μm . The source/drain region expansion must be small** \nenough with respect to the gate-metal-defined channel length for short-channel device fabrication. To confirm the channel length scalability of the developed oxide TFT, the channel length dependence of the transfer characteristics was evaluated. \nL=3um L=6um L=10um L=20um Vgs (V) Vgs\nwithout Shield with Shield Vds (V)\ntransfer characteristics at Vds**=0.1 V. The channel length and** \nchannel width were L=3 μm–20 μm and W**=4 μm, respectively. No** \nserious negative threshold voltage shift was observed in the shortchannel TFT, even at L**=3 μm. The source/drain expansion that** \nwas estimated using the channel resistance method was ΔL=**0.3** \nμm. The threshold voltage remained almost constant, regardless of the channel length, because ΔL**=0.3 μm was small enough with** respect to the channel length. The small source/drain expansion is attributed to the relatively small oxygen diffusion coefficient when compared with that of hydrogen . Because this small ΔL **value** corresponds to a small source/drain-to-gate overlap, low parasitic capacitance, which is suitable for high-resolution and high-speed driving, was successfully realized. \nSaturation of the output characteristics is also required in the short-channel device because the driving TFT in a pixel circuit for an OLED display acts as a constant current source for the OLED device. Figure 3 shows the output characteristics of TFTs with and without the shield metal. The channel width and channel length were W=6 μm and L**=3 μm, respectively. In the TFT without** \nshield metal, the saturation characteristic was seriously impaired by a kink current caused by drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL). In contrast, the TFT with the shield showed superior saturation characteristics because the DIBL was effectively \n10-3 W**=1000 μm**\nW**=10 μm** W**=2 μm**\n -15 -10 -5 0 5 10 15 20 \n -15 -10 -5 0 5 10 15 20 \nW=1000um W=100um W=10um W=2um L**=4 μm**\n 5 10 15 20 suppressed by the shield, which fixed the surface potential of the back channel . Channel length scalability was successfully obtained using a combination of the AlO-sputtered self-aligned structure and the shield connected to the source electrode. \n4. Wide-Channel Tft For Integrated Gate Driver\nTo simplify the driver circuit configuration, it is also desirable that the threshold voltage shows no channel width dependence from narrow to wide channels. However, a positive threshold voltage shift attributed to adsorption of impurities such as oxygen and water to the oxide semiconductor surface has been reported . The depletion region in the oxide semiconductor caused by impurity absorption causes a positive threshold voltage shift, especially in narrow-channel-width devices . In addition, an annealing process after formation of the top-gate structure could produce a nonuniform carrier distribution along the channel width direction because the amounts of the diffused dopant or compensation species from the process atmosphere and the device materials differ between the channel center covered by the top gate and the channel edge near the end of the top gate. To confirm the developed oxide TFT's channel width scalability, the channel width dependence of the transfer characteristics was evaluated. \nW=2 μm–1000 μm and L**=4 μm, respectively. No serious positive** threshold voltage shift was observed in the narrow channel device, even at W**=2 μm. The threshold voltage remained almost constant,** \nregardless of the channel width, because the adsorption, doping and compensation species from the process atmosphere and the device materials were effectively blocked by the AlO passivation. \nThis indicates that the AlO layer on the SiO layer wrapped the entire top-gate structure with a sufficiently thick film and provided good step coverage at the edge of the top gate structure. Channel width scalability was successfully obtained through the high impurity barrier performance of the AlO passivation, which realized a uniform carrier distribution along the channel width direction. \n5. Defect Passivation Using Undercoat\nBecause an OLED display is a current-driven device, high reliability is required for the driving TFT in the pixel circuit. This high reliability is also required to integrate the gate driver circuit into the backplane. The hydrogen in IGZO has two functions W/L**=6 μm/3 μm**\nIntensity (arb. unit) **IGZO film**\nUndercoat/IGZO film Undercoat film\n![2_image_1.png](2_image_1.png) Undercoat/IGZO\nin TFT reliability. Some hydrogen degrades oxide TFT reliability, while some hydrogen passivates the electron traps . The defect passivation effect of hydrogen becomes effective at annealing temperatures around 300**C . However, hydrogen is also** \nknown to work as a donor in IGZO films. It is reported that the oxide TFT reliability under positive bias-temperature stress (PBTS) is closely related to the threshold voltage because the trap states below the Fermi level are deactivated as occupied states . In this work, defect reduction by hydrogen passivation and Fermi level control by hydrogen doping to deactivate the electron traps were attempted through use of the undercoat structure. \n+ (mass charge ratio m/z**=2) observed in the single undercoat** \nfilm, the undercoat/IGZO stacked film, and the single IGZO film. As Fig. 5 shows, large-scale hydrogen desorption was observed in the single undercoat film above 250**C. In contrast, negligible** \nhydrogen desorption was observed in the single IGZO film. In the undercoat/IGZO stacked film, hydrogen desorption was of the same order of magnitude as that of the single IGZO film. These results indicate that desorbed hydrogen from the undercoat was almost all captured in the IGZO layer in the undercoat/IGZO stacked film. The undercoat effectively works as a source of hydrogen passivation and hydrogen dopants in IGZO when an appropriate annealing temperature is used. To achieve field-effect behavior in the short-channel device and high reliability under PBTS, the threshold voltage was carefully adjusted to be around 0 V by controlling the undercoat's hydrogen content and the anneal temperature. Precise threshold voltage control was possible because the AlO passivation prevents unintentional impurity adsorption, doping, or channel compensation after the AlO passivation deposition process. \nFigure 6 shows the time dependence of the threshold voltage shift ΔVth during PBTS testing at a gate voltage Vgs**=3 V, a drain** voltage Vds=7 V, and temperature T**=70°C. The channel width and** \nchannel length were W=6 μm and L**=3 μm, respectively. The bias** stress conditions were set to be close to the actual operating conditions for driving TFTs in pixel circuits for OLED displays while the stress temperature was accelerated. The time evolution of the threshold voltage shift is estimated using a power-law time dependence approximated from a stretched exponential model \n. When the TFT lifetime is determined at the limit of ΔVth=3 V, it becomes >3700 days (>10 years), even at high temperatures when compared with the actual use environment.\n 250 300 350 400 **Intensity(arb.unit)**\n 20 40 60 80 100 120 \n20/4 W**=20 μm**\n100/4 W**=100 μm** W**=200 μm** W**=500 μm**\n200/4 500/4 L**=4 μm**\nThe high channel-width-independent reliability is favorable because the integrated gate driver circuit consists of TFTs with various channel widths. As shown in Fig. 4, the threshold voltage is almost independent of the channel width. In other words, the devices with different channel widths have almost the same Fermi level position to deactivate the trap states. Therefore, high channel-width-independent reliability was expected. Figure 7 shows the time dependence of the threshold voltage shift during PBTS testing at Vgs=40 V, Vds=0 V, and T**=90°C. The channel** \nwidth and length were W=20 μm–500 μm and L**=4 μm,** respectively. The threshold voltage shifts are approximately the same among the devices with the various channel widths. The threshold voltage shifts after ~100 h of stress were ~1.2 V, even under highly accelerated stress conditions. The reliability is acceptable for integrated gate driver circuit operation .\n6. Oled Display Demonstration\nIn general, the OLED frontplane contains several organic layers for planarization and isolation of the emitting region. Additionally, insulators deposited by chemical vapor deposition are formed to encapsulate the OLED structures. These layers contain impurities such as hydrogen and water because of the upper fabrication temperature limit. These built-in impurities could easily diffuse into the oxide backplane and cause serious negative threshold voltage shifts and TFT reliability degradation. To verify the stability of the developed oxide TFT backplane in the OLED display, environmental stress tests and display operation tests under accelerated conditions were performed. \n4000 h 4000 h **(b)HTHS**\n90% RH\n 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 \nat T=70C in dry air, and (b) HTHS testing at T=60**C and** 90%RH.

Thick AlO passivation offered improved impurity barrier performance to unify the carrier distribution along the channel width direction and realized wide channel scalability.

The improved reliability offered a TFT driving operation lifetime >10 years and gate driver integration into the backplane. This enhanced scalability and reliability provided a remarkable improvement in the degrees of freedom for pixel circuit and integrated gate driver design.

Introduction\nMetal-oxide (MO) thin-film transistors (TFTs) with indium-gallium-zinc oxide (IGZO) as the channel material are widely reported to have extremely low off-state current \n( off ), far below the measurement limit of a typical semiconductor parameter analyzer.  A methodology and circuit (Fig. 1) capable of overcoming such limitation have been implemented to characterize the off of an IGZO TFT.\n Instead of off being directly measured, it is deduced by monitoring its effects on the voltage at Node F of the circuit.\nComposed of 20,000 TFTs connected in parallel, T1 with\nan effective channel width  of 1 m is assumed to be \nresponsible for the off inducing the decay of F (hence also F) over time. A voltage follower consisting of TFTs T2\nand T3 is used to monitor the time-evolution of F, with its output voltage denoted by OUT. G− is used to bias T3 and \ncontrol its impedance. In general, \nwhere  ≈ 1 is the slope of the transfer curve of the voltage \nfollower. Consequently, $I_{\\text{off}}$ can be expressed as  $$I_{\\text{off}}=\\left|\\begin{array}{c}\\Delta\\,Q_{\\text{F}}\\\\ \\Delta\\,t\\end{array}\\right|=C_{\\text{F}}\\left|\\begin{array}{c}\\Delta\\,V_{\\text{out}}\\\\ k\\,\\Delta\\,t\\end{array}\\right|,$$\nwhere $\\Delta\\,Q_{\\rm F}$ and $\\Delta\\,V_{\\rm OUT}$ are the respective change in $Q_{\\rm F}$\nand OUT over the measurement duration Δ.\nIt is clear the off estimated using this methodology requiring a 1-m wide TFT may not reflect the intrinsic leakage current of a MO TFT since it could be dominated by random leakage-inducing defects. It is also important to point out that F needs to be properly designed to allow a reasonable Δ that is neither too short nor too long. This is accomplished in  by introducing an offset (Fig. 2a)\nbetween the edges of the gate electrode and those of the source/drain (S/D) electrodes, thus reducing the gate-S/D \nThe measurement protocol begins with the setting of the voltage at Node F to F ≈ DW through the \"write\" TFT T4. With an effective total capacitance of F, the corresponding charge F stored at Node F is\nHowever, this is an unusual TFT architecture since such offsets lead to a significant increase in the parasitic S/D \nresistance. Consequently, the off measured for such a TFT \nmay not be representative of a TFT with conventional overlapping gate and S/D electrodes, as shown in Figure 2b.\nAn improved methodology and circuit for measuring off is presently described, employing a separate capacitor to store F and allowing the use of a TFT with realistic dimensions. This methodology has been applied to measure the off of elevated-metal metal-oxide (EMMO) TFTs built on IGZO, with or without fluorination. off of around mid-10−18 A/m has been obtained, with the value slightly lower for an EMMO TFT with a fluorinated channel.\n2. Improved Measurement Circuit\nThe 1-m wide TFT T1 in  exhibited a respective effective F of 100 pF and 1400 pF with (Fig. 2a) or without the S/D offset. The reduced F helped control Δ\nto within a reasonable value. Furthermore, it is assumed in Equation (2) that the voltage follower remains unchanged during Δ. However, this may not be true in practice and a drift in the transfer characteristics of a voltage follower could significantly affect the measurement accuracy.\nAn improved measurement circuit (Fig. 3) is presently \nA monolithically integrated independent F is added to Node F. The value of F could be designed separately from T1 and is set at ~30 pF with an oxide dielectric thickness of 400 nm. This is 2 to 3 orders of magnitude larger than the estimated capacitance values of the parasitic capacitors 1\n2 and 3\n, since the off-state gate-to-S/D capacitance is \n~2.4 fF per m of .  T1 needs no longer be ultra-wide and a channel width/length ⁄ of 100 m/20 m is implemented; the ⁄ of T2 and T3 is 50 m/20 m; and the \"write\" TFT T4 is removed because its contribution to charge leakage could be comparable to that of T1\n3. Measurement Methodology\nA more precise off can be obtained applying the following protocol. The measurement starts with obtaining the drain current D vs. gate voltage G transfer characteristics of T1 using an Agilent 4156C semiconductor parameter analyzer, as shown in Figure 4 for an EMMO TFT \nfor two different values of the drain bias D. \nThe transfer characteristics of the voltage follower (Fig. 5)\nare next measured, immediately before and after the measurement duration Δ. It should be noted that the characteristics are indeed different.\nA probe pin at a defined bias is placed at Node F and quickly withdrawn, thus putting a charge F on F. OUT\nis continuous monitored for a duration of Δ. There are 4 leaking current components from Node F as shown in Figure 3: D through the channel of T1\n, G through the gate of T1\n, O through the voltage follower and C through the capacitor F. Using Equations (1) and (2), one obtains an expression for ΔF:\n$$\\Delta\\,Q_{\\rm F}\\approx C_{\\rm F}\\left(\\frac{V_{\\rm OUT\\,o}}{k_{o}}-\\frac{V_{\\rm OUT\\,\\Delta\\,t}}{k_{\\,\\Delta\\,t}}\\right)\\,\\tag{4}$$  where $V_{\\rm OUT\\,o}$ and $V_{\\rm OUT\\,\\Delta\\,t}$ are the initial and final masses and $V_{\\rm OUT\\,\\Delta\\,t}$ are calculated as a critical \nmeasured OUT ;  and Δare obtained respectively from Figure 5 from the initial and final transfer curves at OUT_o and OUT_Δ\nTwo leakage current measurements are performed with T1 biased in the off-state, one with the source voltage S of T1 set to 0 V and the other with S\nfloating. Clearly D = 0 for the latter configuration. The respective change in F\nresulting from the two measurements are \n$$\\Delta\\,Q_{\\mathrm{F1}}=(I_{\\mathrm{D}}+I_{\\mathrm{G}}+I_{\\mathrm{0}}+I_{\\mathrm{C}})\\,\\Delta\\,t\\;\\;,$$\n$$\\Delta\\,Q_{\\mathrm{F2}}=(I_{\\mathrm{G}}+I_{0}+I_{\\mathrm{C}})\\,\\Delta\\,t\\,\\,\\,.$$\nConsequently, off = D can be extracted by subtracting Equation (6) from (5):\n$$I_{\\mathrm{off}}=C_{\\mathrm{F}}\\left|{\\frac{\\wedge\\,Q_{\\mathrm{F1}}-\\wedge\\,Q_{\\mathrm{F2}}}{\\wedge\\,t}}\\right|.$$\nIf one assumes a voltage resolution of 1 mV, which is 10× \nthat of the resolution of 0.1 mV for Agilent 4156C, the lower limit of off that can be estimated for a measurement duration of 18,000 s would be ~1.5 × 10−18 A. This translates to a W-normalized leakage current of ~1.5 ×\n10−20 A/m for a TFT with W = 100 m.\n4.  Of Emmo Tfts\nThe time variations of OUT with S = 0 and S\nleft floating of an EMMO TFT are shown in Figure 6.\nThe measurement was carried out at 60 oC in the dark. The start and end values of F were obtained using the transfer curves of Figure 5 and summarized in Table I.\nTable I.

Consequently, the normalized leakage current is ~6.79 × 10−18 A/m. \nFluorinated IGZO channel has been widely reported to have better performance attributes , including better reliability, reduced sensitivity to hydrogen contamination and a more positive on. Hitherto its effects on off has not been investigated. The off of EMMO TFT with a fluorinated IGZO channel was measured. The result is compared in Table II with that of the TFT without fluorination.

The new methodology does not require the use of an excessively wide TFT under test, is compatible with conventional TFT architectures, and takes into consideration the shift of voltage follower transfer characteristics. The normalized off of EMMO TFT was estimated to be 6.79 × 10−18 A /m, and lower for one built on a fluorinated channel. These values are significantly larger than that reported in , for an unconventional TFT with a S/D offset."

However, the sputtering technique has limited controllability of the cation compositions in a-IGZO films because the mass producible sputtering system tends to have a single target with a fixed cation composition. Therefore, advanced channel designs cannot be implemented for ultrahigh performance (e.g., bilayer, gradual, or quantum-well bandgap engineering) , . On the other hand, atomic layer deposition (ALD) processes have become a viable alternative to the sputtering process. Intriguing benefits are an accurate controllability of thickness, conformal deposition, and the versatility with regard to the compositions of the IGZO thin film –. Due to the ever-increasing demand on the high carrier mobility of metal–oxide TFTs, various approaches to boost the mobility have been proposed up to know. One of the ways is to increase the indium (In) fraction in the oxide channel layer. However, the photobias stability of the devices with high In fraction is deteriorated due to the facile creation of the oxygen vacancy defect . The tradeoff issue between mobility and stability in a single channel can be alleviated by using the double-channel structure consisting of the front and capping layers; in this strategy, the front layer serves as the mobility enhancing layer, and the capping layer serves to boost the photobias stability , . However, the preparing of such a thin front layer (≤6 nm) is not trivial due to the high growth rate of the sputtering system . The controllability of the thickness and the composition of ALD-derived IGZO films can provide an alternative solution to this issue. Moreover, the potential conformality of the a-IGZO film onto a nanoscale trench structure at a low temperature may provide an opportunity for its application in the next-generation memory and logic devices. For example, the IGZO semiconductor might be able to replace the current amorphous/polycrystalline Si channel layer in 3-D vertical NAND memory devices due to its extremely low leakage current and good mobility. The IGZO\ntransistor may also be fabricated in the back end of line of a chip rather than in the periphery of conventional CMOS logic devices, which would enable the further CMOS scaling.\nOne critical question is to clarify the compatibility of the ALD-derived IGZO transistor compared to the wellestablished sputtered IGZO transistor in terms of the device performance. An IGZO film using ALD is grown via a chemical reaction between cation-bearing precursors and oxidant such as ozone or water, whereas the sputtering method involves the physical impingement of the adatoms from the target onto the growing surface. This completely different growth mechanism may cause the dissimilar structural, as well as chemical and electrical properties of the a-IGZO films, which affects the performance of the resulting field-effect transistors.\nRecently, there have been several reports on the fabrication of a-IGZO transistors by the ALD process –. However, little is known regarding the effect of different deposition routes on the physical and electrical properties of the a-IGZO film and related transistors.\nIn this paper, two IGZO transistors were fabricated by magnetron sputtering and ALD processes where both IGZO films were designed to have a comparable cation composition\n(difference of In and Zn fractions in both films ≤2 at%).\nThe transistor with an ALD-derived IGZO channel exhibited superior field-effect mobility (μFE) of 36.6 cm2/V·s compared to that with a sputtered IGZO channel (20.3 cm2/V·s). On the other hand, the ION/OFF ratios of both devices were preserved to ∼107. The rationale for the superior performance of the ALD-derived IGZO transistors is discussed on the basis of in-situ effective densification of the IGZO layer during the ALD growth.\nIi. Experimental Procedure\nThe bottom gate a-IGZO transistors were fabricated with a staggered structure. A 100-nm SiO2 film was grown via the thermal oxidation on a heavily doped p-type silicon wafer. The highly doped Si substrate acts as the gate electrode, while the thermal SiO2 layer served as the gate insulator.\nFirst, a 16-nm a-IGZO (In:Ga:Zn = 48:38:14 at%) channel layer was deposited by the magnetron sputtering under Ar and O2 atmospheres. The RF power of the IGZO target was 100 W, and the chamber pressure was fixed at 2 mtorr. When ALD IGZO samples were prepared, the a-IGZO films were deposited in a traveling-wave-type ALD apparatus (CN1 Co., Ltd., South Korea). To provide sufficient vapor pressure for three different oxide films, the canister containing the indium precursor was heated to 80 °C, while the canisters containing Ga and Zn precursors were kept at room temperature. Ozone (O3) was used as an oxidant, where a gas mixture consisting of 970-sccm O2 and 30-sccm N2 was introduced into the O3 generator, corresponding to an O3 gas concentration of 200 g/m3 in the chamber. Nitrogen as a carrier gas for the metal precursors was used at a flow rate of 50 sccm. The 16-nm-thick a-IGZO films (In:Ga:Zn =\n50:34:16 at%) were grown where one supercycle consists of several sequential steps of In–O, Ga–O, and Zn–O. The purge time for each metal precursor and O3 was 10 s. The substrate temperature was chosen to be 250 °C, where the self-limiting behaviors of In2O3, Ga2O3, and ZnO films were observed in terms of the substrate temperature.\nThen, both a-IGZO films were patterned by photolithography and a wet etching process, which was followed by the postdeposition annealing (PDA) in the air atmosphere for 1 h at 400 °C. An indium tin oxide film, which served as a source/drain (S/D) electrode, was formed by the dc magnetron sputtering and patterned by a lift-off method.\nThe channel width (W) and length (L) of a-IGZO TFTs were 10 and 50 μm, respectively. Devices were finally subjected\nto contact annealing at 250 °C for 1 h in an air atmosphere. The electrical characteristics of the TFTs were measured at room temperature in the dark using a Keithley 2636 source meter. The chemical composition and the areal density of the a-IGZO films were characterized by the X-ray fluorescence device (Quan'X EDXRF, Spectrace Co.), for which the atomic concentration and density measurement were calibrated by the proton-induced X-ray emission. The structural properties of the a-IGZO films were evaluated by glancing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD, Rigaku Model SmartLab, Rigaku Corporation) using Cu Kα radiation and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM2100F, JEOL Ltd.). The chemical properties of the a-IGZO film were analyzed by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Theta Probe, Thermo Fisher Scientific Co.). High-resolution X-ray reflectivity (XRR) measurements were performed to analyze the roughness, mass density, and thickness of the a-IGZO films (X'pert-PRO,\nPhilips Inc.). The obtained XRR data were fitted by using the Philips Wingixa software package. The electronic structure, which includes the features of the conduction band, was analyzed using the X-ray absorption spectra (XAS). The XAS\nwere measured using the coherent X-ray beam source at the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory on beamline 10-D.\nIii. Results And Discussion\nFig. 1 shows the representative transfer characteristics of the a-IGZO TFTs with sputtered and ALD-derived channel layers. The field-effect mobility (μFE) was calculated from the linear transfer characteristics as μFE = Lgm/(WCOXVDS) at VDS = 0.1 V, where gm is the transconductance and COX is the oxide capacitance of the gate insulator per unit area. The threshold voltage (VTH) was determined by the gate voltage (VGS), which induces a drain current (IDS) of L/W × 10 nA at VDS of 5.1 V. The subthreshold swing\n(SS = dVDS/dlogIDS [V/decade]) was extracted from the linear part of the log(IDS) versus VGS plot. The ON-state current (ION) and OFF-state current (IOFF) were determined by the IDS current at VGS of 20 and −20 V, respectively.\nCOMPARISON OF THE ELECTRICAL PARAMETERS INCLUDING\nμFE, VTH , SS, AND ION/OFF RATIO FOR BOTH DEVICES\nThe a-IGZO TFT with the conventional sputtered channel showed a μFE value of 20.1 ± 0.6 cm2/V·s, VTH of 0.52 ± 0.13 V, SS of 0.49 ± 0.07 V/decade, and an ION/OFF\nratio of ∼1 × 107 [Fig. 1(a)] and Table I. These characteristics are comparable to the state-of-the-art characteristics of a-IGZO TFTs that have been implemented in the AMOLED television product . Substantial improvement\n(∼36.6 cm2/V·s) in terms of μFE was observed clearly for the TFT with an ALD-derived IGZO channel, as shown in Fig. 1(b) and Table I. Generally, the μFE value of aIGZO TFTs can be affected by the cation composition, film roughness, film density, and impurity residue of the channel layer. The cation compositions of In:Ga:Zn were found to be 48:38:14 and 50:34:16 at% for the sputtered and ALD-derived IGZO films, respectively. Although higher In fraction (∼2 at%) would partially contribute to the improvement in mobility due to the enhanced formation of a percolation pathway in the conduction band,\n>80% increase of mobility for the ALD-derived IGZO transistors can only be somewhat explained by this slight difference in the In fraction , .\nFig. 2 shows the variations in the width-normalized device resistance (RONW) as a function of L for both devices. The contact resistance (RC) value extracted from the y-axis intercept of the extrapolated linear fit of RONW versus L. . The extracted RC values of sputtered and ALD-derived a-IGZO\nTFTs were 162 and 84.6 ·cm, respectively. The smaller RC for ALD-derived a-IGZO TFTs was partially responsible for its higher μFE value. It can be explained by the higher carrier density of the ALD-derived IGZO film, which will be discussed later.\nFig. 3 shows the GIXRD patterns of the as-deposited and 400 °C annealed IGZO films. No sharp peak for all IGZO films was observed. The peaks near 52° and 56° were assigned to (321) and (400) reflections, respectively, from the Si substrate  because these peaks appeared for the SiO2/Si sample without the IGZO film. This result indicates that both ALD-derived and sputtered IGZO thin films annealed Fig. 4. Cross-sectional TEM images of the (a) sputtered and (b) ALDderived IGZO films annealed at 400 °C. Their SAED patterns are also shown.\nat 400 °C have an amorphous phase. The amorphous phase nature of the sputtered and ALD-derived IGZO films (annealed at 400 °C) was also confirmed by TEM, as shown in Fig. 4.\nThe selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns having only diffuse ring shape clearly indicate the amorphous nature of both IGZO films. Interestingly, the ALD-derived IGZO\nsample exhibited better smooth interface roughness between the IGZO and SiO2 films compared to that of the sputtered IGZO sample, which can be another reason for its superior mobility due to the reduced interface scattering mechanism.\nThe chemical binding states of the constituent elements within a-IGZO films by sputtering and ALD processes were examined using XPS. Fig. 5(a)–(c) shows the In 3d, Ga 2p, and Zn 2p XP spectra of a-IGZO films. In this paper, the photoelectron binding energies were calibrated to the C 1s peak for C–C bonds at 284.5 eV. The O 1s XP spectra were deconvoluted into three asymmetric Lorenzian–Gaussian peaks with the Shirley background. The curve-fitting was performed for all spectra with the full-width at half-maximum and the ratio of the Gaussian-to-Lorentzian parameters fixed as a constant while allowing the peak binding energies and areas to vary. The In 3d5/2, Ga 2p3/2, and Zn 2p3/2 peak positions of sputtered a-IGZO films were 445.3, 1118.4, and 1022.3 eV, respectively, indicating the typical formation of metal–oxygen (M–O) ionic bonding . The positions of these M–O lattice peaks for the ALD-derived a-IGZO film were identical to those for the sputtered a-IGZO film. The O 1s XP spectra for sputtered and ALD-derived a-IGZO\nfilms are shown in Fig. 5(d). The O 1s peak was deconvoluted into three peaks at 530.5, 531.1, and 531.7 eV , . The O 1s peak at 530.5 eV was assigned to the oxygen bonded to fully coordinated metal ions, and the peak at 531.1 eV was assigned to the oxygen bonded to the under coordinated metal ions (referred to as VO for simplicity). The peak at 531.7 eV was indexed to impurity-related oxygen,\nsuch as hydroxyl groups. The area ratio of the Vo-related peak was 32% for the sputtered a-IGZO film and only 27%\nfor the ALD-derived a-IGZO film, whereas the OH-related peak area was similar between both films (also see Table II). The reduction in the Vo concentration for the ALD-derived a-IGZO film was unexpected because its slightly larger In (smaller Ga) fraction favors the higher concentration of Vo due to the weak bond strength of In–O compared to those of Ga–O and Zn–O. This phenomenon may be directly related to different growth mechanisms of the a-IGZO film.\nTo obtain an insight on the growing method-dependent film formation, the XRR analysis for both a-IGZO films before and after thermal annealing at 400 °C was performed.\nFig. 6 shows the XRR data for the a-IGZO films before and after thermal annealing. An X-ray beam in the XRR analysis impinges the surface of the thin film at a low incidence angle. The film surface acts as a mirror under the critical angle of the total reflection, θ C ; i.e., the beam is completely reflected. At the angles larger than θ C , the measured X-ray intensity rapidly drops, and the film thickness and roughness can be calculated by fitting the full reflective curve with the established models . The mass density for a-IGZO films was calculated from this critical angle ( θ C ) for the total external reflection for the IGZO films. Mass densities of as-deposited and annealed a-IGZO films by sputtering were 5.44 and 5.49 g/cm 3 , respectively, indicating that the densification of the a-IGZO film occurs during the thermal annealing at 400 °C. This result is understandable because the thermal energy during annealing facilitates the atomic migration and rearrangement, leading to an increased atomic packing density. Simultaneously, the surface roughness was also improved via the thermal annealing for the sputtered\n| Sputtered IGZO   | ALD IGZO     |          |              |          |\n|------------------|--------------|----------|--------------|----------|\n| Sample ID        | As deposited | Annealed | As-deposited | Annealed |\n| RMS              | 0.35         | 0.30     | 0.50         | 0.45     |\n| (nm)             |              |          |              |          |\n| Mass density     | 5.4          | 5.49     | 5.65         | 5.60     |\n| (g/cm 3 )        |              |          |              |          |\nIGZO films (see Table III ). In contrast, the as-deposited a-IGZO film by ALD exhibited a substantially higher mass density of 5.64 g/cm 3 . It is noteworthy to discuss the reason for this behavior. In ALD processes, the chemical reactions between metal precursors and ozone oxidant occur at the elevated substrate temperature of 250 °C. They stop and selfsaturate when the surface reactive sites are entirely depleted.\nThis so-called self-limiting nature can provide the atomic layer control, which can not only reduce the formation of point defects such as Vo and VM but also enhance the atomic packing efficiency of growing a-IGZO films compared to the kinetically controlled continuous sputtering processes. Thermal annealing at 400 °C resulted in a slightly decreased mass density of IGZO (5.60 g/cm 3 ), which can be attributed to the thermal desorption of the impurities that were incorporated during the ALD processes (e.g., carbon and hydrogen). The ALD-derived a-IGZO film had a mass density of 5.60 g/cm 3 ,\nand this density was higher than that of the sputtered a-IGZO film (5.49 g/cm 3 ). The lower Vo concentration and the higher mass density of a-IGZO samples are striking features of ALD-\nderived films compared to sputtered a-IGZO samples, and these characteristics are related to the superior carrier mobility of the resulting a-IGZO transistors.\nThe electrical role of Vo defects depends on the local coordination structure in a-IGZO. Vo with a large open space or smaller coordination number as from a corner sharing site is calculated to be a shallow or deep trap state, which is\n| S PUTTERING AND ALD P ROCESSES   |                |                  |             |\n|----------------------------------|----------------|------------------|-------------|\n| O 1s peak [eV]                   |                |                  |             |\n| Sample ID                        | Lattice oxygen | Oxygen deficient | OH impurity |\n| (530.5 eV)                       | (531.1 eV)     | (531.7 eV)       |             |\n| Sputter IGZO                     | 0.63           | 0.32             | 0.05        |\n| ALD IGZO                         | 0.69           | 0.27             | 0.05        |\nfrequently observed for the as-deposited or open structure .\nOn the other hand, Vo with fully coordinated cations such as on a face or edge of an a-IGZO film acts as a beneficial shallow donor, which is favored in a denser network. It is\nevident that the total summation of a shallow donor VO and trap-like deep VO defects was reduced for the ALD-derived a-IGZO samples. The proportion of shallow donor VO defects over trap-like deep VO defects would be a quite interesting parameter for determining the carrier transport capability. The higher packing density of the ALD-derived a-IGZO films suggests that the portion of shallow VO to deep VO defects dramatically increased, resulting in an increase in the carrier generation. This means that the trap-like deep VO concentration for the ALD-derived a-IGZO samples can be strongly suppressed as a result of film densification. Indeed, the carrier density of the ALD-derived a-IGZO film (4.7 × 1018 cm−3)\nwas estimated to be higher than that of the sputtered a-IGZO\nfilm (1.0 × 1018 cm−3) from the I–V analysis, as shown in Fig. 7. This is responsible for the higher μFE value of ALD-derived a-IGZO transistors because the carrier mobility is proportional to the ne value in the IGZO system, which is known as the \"percolation conduction mechanism\" .\nFig. 8 shows the normalized O K1 edge XAS spectra of the as-deposited and annealed IGZO films grown by sputtering and ALD. The O K1 edge XAS spectra of the IGZO films are related to the O p-projected states of the conduction band, which is comprised unoccupied hybridized orbitals for In 5sp, Ga 4sp, Zn 4sp, and O 2p ranging from 530 to 550 eV. The major features (denoted \"A\" and \"B\" in the spectra of the a-IGZO films, Fig. 8) can be attributed mainly to the In 5sp, Ga 4s, and Zn 4s states and In 5sp and Zn 4sp states, respectively, . A noticeable suppression of the A/(A + B) ratio and the enhancement of the B/(A + B) ratio were observed in the ALD-derived annealed IGZO sample compared with the sputtered annealed IGZO sample. Peak B\nrepresents a more dominant hybridization of the sp orbitals\n![4_image_3.png](4_image_3.png) for In, Ga, and Zn, while the orbital hybridization of In 5s, Zn 4s, and O 2p is more involved in peak A (lower energy).\nThe enhancement in the hybridization of the sp orbital for the ALD-derived a-IGZO sample compared to the sputtered a-IGZO sample may be related to the improved charge transport due to the reduction of anharmonicity by the increase in the symmetrical sp orbital hybridization .\nFinally, the gate bias stress- and photobias stress-induced instabilities for the a-IGZO TFTs with sputtered and ALDderived channel layers were investigated, which is one of the important figure of merits to compare the TFT performance.\nFor more reliable evaluation, both devices were encapsulated by the Al2O3 film which was deposited by the ALD\nmethod. The a-IGZO TFTs were stressed using VGS values of 20 and −20 V for the positive gate bias stress (PBS) and a negative gate bias stress (NBS), respectively. In the case of the negative bias illumination stress (NBIS), a green LED light source with a photointensity of 8.1 μW/cm2 was used under the identical NBS conditions. Fig. 9 shows the variation in the VTH shift (VTH) of the encapsulated a-IGZO TFTs as a function of PBS and NBS times. The a-IGZO TFTs with the sputtered channel layer under PBS and NBS for 3600 s suffered from VTH values of 1.7 and −0.5 V, respectively.\nInterestingly, the device with the ALD-derived channel layer exhibited the improved PBS stability: the VTH values after PBS and NBS testing were reduced to 0.5 and −0.5 V,\nrespectively. The pre-existing trap-like V2+O states are likely to capture two free electrons due to its negative U-center nature when the application of PBS creates the accumulation of free electron carriers [Qn = COX (VGS,ST−VTH,initial)] .\nThis conversion process from V2+O to VO during the PBS\nduration would result in the positive VTH shift where the VTH displacement (VTH) is proportional to the concentration of preexisting V2+O states in the channel layer. This explanation is consistent with the superior PBS stability of the device with the ALD-derived channel because the ALD process favors the less formation of trap-like VO defect compared to the sputtering deposition as discussed earlier in the XPS data. This interpretation can be further supported by NBIS\ninstabilities of both devices. The sputtered a-IGZO TFTs suffered from the negative VTH shift (VTH = −6.3 V) after the NBIS duration for 3600 s. Conversely, the reduced VTH\nof −2.5 V was observed for the ALD-derived a-IGZO TFTs after the identical NBIS duration.\nIn summary, the electrical performance of the sputtered and ALD-derived a-IGZO transistors was examined.\nThe μFE values (36.6 cm2/V·s) for the ALD-derived a-IGZO\ntransistors were significantly improved compared to that for the sputtered a-IGZO transistors (20.1 cm2/V·s), whereas the SS (0.41–0.49 V/decade) and ION/OFF ratio (∼108) were comparable to each other. The XRR and XPS analyses revealed out that the ALD-derived a-IGZO films had a higher mass density (5.60 g/cm3) and lower VO concentration (27%) than those of the sputtered a-IGZO films (5.49 g/cm3 and 32%,\nrespectively), which can be attributed to the unique selflimiting mechanism of the ALD processes. The higher packing density of the ALD-derived a-IGZO film is interpreted to be beneficial: the dominance of shallow VO to deep VO defects leads to a higher ne and, thus, higher carrier mobility of the resulting a-IGZO transistors. The smoother channel/insulator interface and low RC values for ALD-derived a-IGZO TFTs were also partially responsible for their high carrier mobility.\nTherefore, the ALD-derived IGZO-based transistors are anticipated to be an alternative to the conventional sputtered IGZO-based devices. Furthermore, the excellent ALD-based conformality and tailoring capability of bandgap engineering would allow an a-IGZO semiconductor to be used in the nextgeneration memory and logic devices."

        "text": "Comparative Study On Light-Induced Bias Stress Instability Of Igzo Transistors With Sinx And Sio2 Gate Dielectrics Kwang Hwan Ji, Ji-In Kim, Yeon-Gon Mo, Jong Han Jeong, Shinhyuk Yang, Chi-Sun Hwang, Sang-Hee Ko Park, Myung-Kwan Ryu, Sang-Yoon Lee, And Jae Kyeong Jeong\nAbstract—This letter examines the effect of the gate dielectric material on the light-induced bias-temperature instability of an In–Ga–Zn–O (IGZO) thin-film transistor (TFT). After applying positive and negative bias stresses, the SiNx**-gated TFT exhibited**\ninferior stability to the SiO2**-gated TFT, which was explained**\nby the charge trapping mechanism. However, light illumination under a negative bias stress accelerated the negative displacement of the threshold voltage (Vth) of the SiNx-gated IGZO TFT\ncompared to that of the SiO2-gated TFT. This was attributed to the injection of photocreated hole carriers into the underlying gate dielectric bulk region as well as the hole trapping at the gate/\nIndex Terms—a-InGaZnO, amorphous semiconductor, bias stability, multicomponent oxide semiconductor, thin-film transistors\nRECENTLY, In–Ga–Zn–O (IGZO) thin-film transistors\n(TFTs) have attracted considerable interest for applications to the active-matrix (AM) backplane of LCD and OLED\ndisplays –. Although high-performance IGZO TFTs have been fabricated, light- and bias-induced instability is still a critical issue to be resolved because the exposure of the switching transistor to backlight or ambient light would be inevitable during the operation of the display panel. In this regard, there have been several reports, including the effect of moisture , device configuration , and channel cation composition , on the light-induced bias instability. However, there are no reports of the effect of the gate dielectric material on the photoreliability of IGZO TFTs. This letter reports the degradation mechanism of the threshold voltage (Vth) under photon-irradiated gate bias stress conditions for IGZO TFTs. In particular, the impact of the different gate dielectrics on the light-induced bias-thermal instability of IGZO TFTs was investigated. The fabricated device had SiNx and SiO2 films as a gate dielectric due to their large area scalability in flat panel AM displays.\nIi. Experimental Procedure\nA 200-nm-thick SiNx film as a gate dielectric layer was deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) on a patterned Mo (2000-nm-thick)/glass substrate at 380 ◦C. An a-IGZO film, 50 nm in thickness, was grown by dc sputtering at room temperature. After defining the IGZO\nchannel using photolithography and wet etching, a 200-nmthick SiO2 etch stopper was deposited by PECVD and patterned by dry etching to define the source/drain contact hole. A Mo source/drain electrode (200 nm) was formed using a conventional sputtering system and patterned by photolithography and dry etching.\nThe fabricated TFTs had a bottom-gate and top-contact configuration . For comparison, a PECVD-derived SiO2 film as a gate insulator was also deposited before active channel deposition. The thickness of the SiO2 gate insulator was designed to be 120 nm to have a similar gate capacitance: The gate capacitances per unit area of the SiNx- and SiO2-gated devices were 2.66 × 10−8 and 2.88 × 10−8 F/cm2, respectively.\nFinally, the samples were subject to thermal annealing at 350 ◦C for 1 h. The electrical measurements were carried out in air using an Agilent B1500 A precision semiconductor parameter analyzer.\nIii. Results And Discussion\nFig. 1(a) and (b) shows the transfer characteristics of the IGZO TFTs with SiNx (device A) and SiO2 (device B) as a gate insulator (W/L = 24/10 μm), respectively. The μFE value was calculated from the maximum transconductance (μFE =\nLgm*/W C*iVDS, where Ci and gm are the gate capacitance per unit area and the transconductance, respectively) . The threshold voltage (Vth) was determined by adjusting the gate voltage, which induces a drain current of L/W× 10 nA at a VDS of 15.1 V. In addition, the subthreshold gate swing [SS = dVGS/d log IDS (V/dec)] was extracted from the linear portion of the log(IDS)-versus-VGS plot. Device A exhibited a μFE of\n13.7 ± 0.08 cm 2 /V · s, SS value of 0.38 ± 0.01 V/dec, V th of 0.7 ± 0.17 V, and I ON / OFF ratio of > 10 9 . On the other hand, device B showed significantly improved performance: The µ FE .\nand SS ' values were enhanced to 16.9 ± 0.12 cm 2 /V · s and 0.16 ± 0.006 V/dec, respectively, with a similar V th (0.1 V)\nand I ON / OFF ratio (> 10 9 ). The device performance reported herein is comparable to the state-of-the-art characteristics for the IGZO TFTs with various novel gate insulators, including Y 2 O 3 , Al 2 O 3 , and ZrO 2 .\nFig. 2(a) and (b) shows the evolution of the transfer curve as a function of the applied positive gate bias stress (PBS) time for devices A and B, respectively. The devices were stressed under the following conditions: V GS was set to 20 V at room temperature, and the stress duration was 10 000 s. For device A,\na parallel V th shift of 0.77 V to a higher voltage with increasing PBS time occurred without an accompanying change in µ FE ,\nS , and the I ON / OFF ratio. This positive V th shift after the application of the PBS has been attributed frequently to the charge trapping of accumulated electron carriers in the channel region at/near the gate dielectric and channel interface ,\ncan be excluded because high-quality SiO 2 films (etch stop layer) were coated on the channel region as a passivation layer\n. The V th stability of the IGZO TFTs under the PBS was improved dramatically by replacing the gate insulator with a PECVD-derived SiO 2 film [see Fig. 2(b)]. A V th shift of only 6 mV was observed for device B after an identical PBS\napplication for 10 000 s. If it is assumed that the V th instability of the IGZO TFTs is due to the charge trapping at/near the gate/channel interface, the interfacial trap density ( N it ) should adversely affect the bias stability. The maximum N it value can be extracted from the SS value ( Nit = ( SS log( e )/( kT/q) −\n1) C i /q , where k is the Boltzmann's constant, T is the absolute temperature, and q is the elementary electron charge) ,\nwhich assumes that there is no semiconductor bulk trap in the IGZO thin film. The calculated N it,max (3.0 × 10 11 /cm 2 ) for device B was much smaller than that (8.9 × 10 11 /cm 2 ) for device A. This lower N it,max for device B would explain why only a negligible V th shift caused by the charge trapping was observed for device B. The effect of the gate dielectric material on the negative gate bias instability of the resulting IGZO TFTs was examined. The devices were stressed under the following conditions: V GS was set to − 20 V, and the stress duration was 10 000 s. The application of a negative gate bias stress (NBS) to devices A and B at room temperature caused negative V th shifts of 0.26 and 0.20 V, respectively. At an elevated temperature of 60 °C, the negative movements of V th for devices A and B were increased to 0.53 and 0.29 V, respectively, as shown in Fig. 2(c)\nand (d). Therefore, the NBS-induced instability of device A was inferior to that of device B at 60 °C and room temperature. This is consistent with the aforementioned charge trapping model.\nHole carriers, which may be created in the channel region under NBS conditions, tend to be trapped at the interfacial defect states. Therefore, device A with a larger N it would suffer from a larger charge trapping phenomenon leading to enhanced V th instability.\nTo double check this interpretation, the TFTs were irradiated with white light during the application of the NBS\n( V GS = −20 V). A white halogen lamp was used as a light source, which consisted of visible light ranging from 400- to 700-nm wavelengths. The intensity of the light source was\n~ 1 mW/cm 2 , which was calibrated by photometry. The intensity of 1 mW/cm 2 was chosen to meet the required brightness for the practical application of flat panel displays . Fig. 3(a) and (b) shows the time evolution of the transfer curves for both devices as a function of the light-illuminated NBS condition for devices A and B, respectively. The inferior stability of the nitride device was manifested more clearly under the lightilluminated NBS condition. Although the Vth value for device A was shifted significantly to the negative direction by 11.6 V,\ndevice B exhibited only Vth movement of −0.78 V. The consistent inferior stability of the TFT with the SiNx gate dielectric is believed to originate from its higher Nit value, which is reconciled with the aforementioned charge trapping model. Under the light-illuminated NBS condition, electron-hole pairs in the channel region would be generated by light. The photocreated electron carrier will be repelled to the back channel surface, whereas the photogenerated hole carriers are attracted to the gate dielectric layer by the negative gate voltage and become trapped at the interfacial trap state. This has been suggested as a plausible explanation for the light-enhanced negative bias instability of oxide TFTs , . However, it is not obvious that the approximately 14-fold increase in the amount of the Vth movement for device A (device A: ΔVth = −11.6 V; device B: ΔVth = −0.78 V) under the light-illuminated NBS condition can be attributed entirely to the approximately three times higher Nit,max of device A. Indeed, the hole carriers near the channel region feel the hole potential barrier (i.e., valence band offset) at the interface between the gate dielectric and channel layer. Interestingly, the valence offset between the SiNx and IGZO film can be estimated as ∼0.15 eV, which is much smaller than (∼2.80 eV) that between the SiO2 and IGZO film ,\n. Therefore, the photocreated hole carriers can be injected easily into the SiNx gate dielectric due to its lower valence band offset value, which would be partly responsible for the inferior stability of device A. Therefore, the possibility of hole injection into the gate dielectric bulk region cannot be excluded.\nIt is noted that the fast recovery of Vth was observed for device A. Without any thermal annealing, device A exhibited a significant recovery of Vth by ∼8 V after the 10-h exposure to the air ambient, suggesting that most of the photocreated trap states (∼70%) are temporal traps. On the other hand, the 250 ◦C thermal annealing was found to result in the full recovery of Vth, which indicates that the hole carrier injection indeed cannot be neglected.\nFinally, we noted that the stretch-out of the subthreshold drain current region was observed for only the SiO2 device, as shown in Fig. 3(b), suggesting that the light and bias combination stress can create some trap states at the interface between the IGZO and SiO2. The reason that the SiNx device did not exhibit such behavior is not clear at this time.\nAn IGZO TFT with a PECVD-derived SiO2 gate dielectric exhibited greater bias stability and light-induced bias stability than the device with the SiNx gate dielectric. This phenomenon has been discussed based on a charge trapping mechanism.\nTherefore, the SiO2-gated IGZO TFTs can be implemented as backplane electronics in the next-generation AM flat panel displays."

        "text": "Comprehensive Review On Amorphous Oxide Semiconductor Thin Film Transistor\nReceived: 30 December 2019 / Revised: 10 March 2020 / Accepted: 28 March 2020 © The Korean Institute of Electrical and Electronic Material Engineers 2020\nOxide materials are one of the most advanced key technology in the thin flm transistors (TFTs) for the high-end of device applications. Amorphous oxide semiconductors (AOSs) have leading technique for fat panel display, active matrix organic light emitting display, active matrix liquid crystal display as well as thin flm electronic devices due to their excellent electrical characteristics, such as feld efect mobility (μFE), subthreshold swing (SS) and threshold voltage (Vth). Researchers from various felds have studied and considered ways to improve µFE of AOS TFT, which has been studied for 16 years since 2004. \nSince 2004, mobility has been increased by using various methods, such as designing novel amorphous oxide materials, changing device structures, or adopting new post-treatment. The development of feld efect mobility as well as the stability enhancement has been comprehensively reviewed in this report.\nKeywords Amorphous oxide semiconductor · Thin flm transistor · Mobility · Stability · Comprehensive review\n1 **Introduction**\nAccording to the Moore's law, the number of transistors doubles approximately every 2 years as shown in Fig. 1a . \nHowever, the Moore's law has been broken because of fast speed of developing integrity. Nowdays, the Kim's law has been applied to the memory stack as shown in Fig. 1b. As various displays and applications have evolved, the demand for high performance on devices has increased. In particular, high end product displays and integrated circuits which required high performance [3–5]. Among many candidate materials to be the next generation electronic applications, amorphous oxide semiconductor (AOS) materials are promising candidate materials due to the excellent characteristics. \nAt the 2004, the development of AOS thin flm transistor \n(TFT), a-IGZO TFT by Hosono et al.  has been remarkable. In the early period, it showed characteristics not well developed, such as low feld efect mobility (µFE), bad on–of current ratio (*Ion/of*), and large subthreshold swing (SS). It is important to note that the researches on the method to increase the mobility of the AOS TFT for the next generation display and various applications. Mobility changes were strongly depending on the composition ratio of a-IGZO material to clearly defne mobility. Figure 2a and b show each characteristic of composition materials . It is clearly shown the In2O3 increases the mobility. By the steady and continuous research, the stabilization and the mass production of materials has been achieved even in industrial feld. \nNowdays, the research have been carried out in new felds, such as integrated circuit, memory devices, synapse, neuromorphic and artifcial intelligence (AI) using some of the characteristics of AOS materials [7–9]. The µFE was calculated by the following Eq. (1) :\nΜfe = (1) L Gm W Vdscox\nwhere the W/L is the width/length of the channel layer, gm is the trans-conductance, Cox is the oxide capacitance of the gate dielectric and Vds is the drain to source voltage. \nIn this paper, we reviewed and summarized the ways to improve AOS TFT mobility and stability by three category of designing new channel materials of AOS, fabricating new structure of the AOS TFTs, and adopting new post processing treatment on the channel materials.\n2 Materials Based Aos Tfts\nFigure 3 shows the total µ FE depending on the year. There are several approaches in material modifications increase the µ FE . At the 2004, H. Hosono et al. [ 5 ] reported the amorphous InGaZnO (a-IGZO) with 5.5 cm 2 /Vs. Figure 4 shows (a) covalent semiconductors, for examples, silicon crystalline and amorphous. The post-transition-metal oxide semiconductors with crystalline and amorphous phase were shown in Fig. 4b. After this, lots of researchers tried to apply these materials to device applications. After developed the a-IGZO, indium is the key element of the AOS\nTFTs. Because In 3+ plays a significant role in achieving high mobility, which is attributed to configuration of 4 d 105 s 0 [5, 1 - 13 ]. So, most materials are developed with In-based materials. Tsukagoshi et al. [ 14 ] reported the InO x -based doped with TiO 2 , WO 3 , or SiO 2 . Their mobility exhibit 32, 30 and 17 cm 2 /Vs with In-Ti–O, In-W–O and In-Si–O,\nAmong the lots of materials, indium (In) has the problems, such as high fabrication cost because of the rare atom in the earth and toxicity. So, AOS needs the new materials, i.e. , In-free materials. In a previous study, we reported the In-free material AOS TFTs called amorphous Zn–Sn–O\n(a-ZTO) and amorphous Si doped Zn–Sn–O (a-SZTO) [ 15 ].\nFigure 5 shows (a) the crystal structure of c-Zn 2 SnO 4 , the amorphous structure of (b) a-SZTO and (c) a-ZTO. Also, E. M. C. Fortunato et al. [ 16 ] reported the In free AOS\nTFTs with high mobility using the amorphous GaSnZnO\n(a-GSZO). The a-GSZO TFT have the different mobility from 7.9 to 24.6 cm 2 /Vs depending on the annealing temperature.\nNitrogen doped to AOS materials have been reported to show the increase of µ FE because the bandgap has been reduced compared with the conventional AOS channel materials [ 17 ]. Figure 6 shows the band diagram of Zn 3 N 2 , ZnON, and ZnO. Ryu et al. [ 17 ] reported the ZnON with high mobility value about 99 cm 2 /Vs TFT. Figure 7 shows the atomic structure of ZnON formed by melt-and-quench simulations. Also, Kim et al. [ 18 ] and Ok et al. [ 19 ] reported the ZnON TFTs with 42.6 and 50 cm 2 /Vs. Park et al. [ 20 ]\nreported the high µ FE of 52.5 cm 2 /Vs of ZnON TFTs with UV-assisted ozone (UVO) annealing at 150 °C.\n3 Structure Based Aos Tfts\nThe confguration of AOS TFTs are primarily related to the µFE. There are 4 types of TFT structures, such as staggered, inverted staggered, coplanar and inverted coplanar. In general, bottom-gate structure has been widely used due to the convenience in fabrication . However, this structure has critical disadvantage of the large parasitic capacitance due to the overlap between the gate and the S/D . The large parasitic capacitance occurs the degradation of electrical characteristic of TFTs. Therefore, the AOS TFT needs the self-aligned structure to achieve the high performance, necessary. Kim et al. reported the µFE of 5.5 cm2/Vs with a-GIZO TFT at self-aligned top gate structure . To increase the µFE, many research groups tried to stack the channel, such as bi-layer, double layer and buried layer, etc. \nThe µFE is mainly afected by the current path at the bottom. In the general, most of channel layer consist of 2 parts, \nincreasing the IZO channel thickness.\nreported the a-IGZO TFT by double layers with no oxygen flow (NOF) and oxygen flow (OF) channel. Figure 11 shows the schematic diagrams of (a) single layer-TFT and (b) double layer TFT. The single layer TFT of NOF and OF\nexhibit the 12 cm 2 /Vs of µ FE . However, the double layer shows 19 cm 2 /Vs of µ FE . Also, Lee et al. [ 29 ] reported the TFT using the Hf doped IZO (HIZO) channel materials with different Hf ratios. As a result, device stability as well as the mobility of dual (or bi, double, burried) layer devices can also be significantly improved compared with a single channel layer.\nThe metal capping (MC) layer is easier way to increase the mobility compared with the previous method. This is a method of improving mobility by depositing metal on\ntop of the channel layer, which is usually achieved by two mechanisms. First, free electrons in the channel layer may increase as electrons in the metal diffuse into the channel layer due to work function differences. In a previous study, we reported the carrier controllability with variable metal capping layer [ 30 ]. Figure 12 shows (a) the schematic diagram of conventional-TFT and metal capped-TFT, (b)\nthe transfer curve and (c) electrical characteristics of TFTs with variable metal. The µ FE increased from 20.79 cm 2 /Vs as conventional TFT to 37.84 cm 2 /Vs as A1 capped TFT. It is attributed by the work function as shown Fig. 13 . The Ag metal capped degrade the electrical characteristics because of the high work function. In other hand, the Al capped layer have lowest work function compared with other materials. In the second case, the mobility is increased because of the ω -shape current-path in the channel layer [ 31 ]. Figure 14 shows simulated total current–density distribution of SZTO\nTFTs as function of MC-length with (a) 0 (CON-), (b) 20,\n(c) 30 and (d) 40 µ m. The L of MC layer increased, µ FE also increased because the carrier can easily pass the path.\n4 Post Process Based Aos Tfts\nF shows the total µ FE using the post-process depending on the year. There are several post-process treatments to increase the mobility. In general, the oxygen vacancies\n(Vo) are well known as the primary driving mechanism for amorphous oxide materials. Where the oxygen atom escapes in the channel material, two electrons are generated [ 32 ].\nof SZTO-TFTs with diferent capping layer in thermal equilibrium. a noncontact, b electron-injection model (when ΦSZTO>*Φcapping layer*), and c electron-depletion model (when ΦSZTO<*Φcapping layer*) \nUsing this phenomenon is an efective way to obtain a large amount of electrons. The simplest method among the numerous methods is to perform plasma treatment on the channel layer. At the 2007, according to Jeong et al. , the mobility of the pristine a-IGZO was only 3.3 cm2/Vs, but the Ar plasma treatment achieved 9.1 cm2/Vs. This method has been used in many ways. In particular, it is used to form not only a channel layer but also an S/D electrode .\nIn the case of AOS TFT, still annealing process was necessary even not high temperature annealing like low temperature polycrystalline silicon (LTPS), for the activation of the thin flm. So many researchers have tried to obtain high electrical characteristics and mobility while replacing this annealing. Lee et al.  used microwave annealing technology to fabricate an amorphous InGaZnO Thin Film Transistor (a-IGZO TFT) with 13.9 cm2/Vs carrier mobility instead of conventional thermal annealing. Generally, the ZnO based materials can absorb the electromagnetic wave energy from 2 to 18 GHz frequency range [35–37]. Figure 16a shows the schematic of microwave annealing process. The power of microwave was set at 1P (600 W) and 2P (1200 W), the frequency used at 5.8 GHz. Figure 16b shows the transfer curve of a-IGZO TFTs depending on the microwave annealing conditions. Figure 16c shows the stability of devices depending on the microwave annealing conditions. During the gate bias stress (GBS) measurement, an electric feld of 2.5 MV/cm was used. After the GBS test, the Vth shift of a microwave annealed a-IGZO TFT was reduced from a value of 16.2 V at a power condition of 1P for 100 s to a minimum of 1.6 V at 2P power for 100 s. In addition, W-J. \nCho et al. , a-IGZO with microwave annealing irradiation showed a mobility of 17.4 cm2/Vs (1000 W) higher than conventional thermal annealing of 14 cm2/Vs. As a result of this phenomenon, the microwave annealing process can be same efect as the thermal annealing method to activate the channel layer.\nAs mentioned above, annealing process is required to improve electrical properties in AOS TFTs, and generally performed by furnace and ovens. On the other hand, the rapid thermal process (RTP) ofers several benefts, better uniformity, including faster process times. This is the main key factors in the mass production industry. S–H. Ko. Park et al.  investigated the RTP with near-infrared (NIR) as a heat source, ultra-violet (UV) and deep-ultra-violet (DUV) as a light source. It is possible to activate the channel layer easier, can provides the much higher energy. Figure 17a shows the structure of back channel etched (BCE) TFTs, \n(b) material information used in this work, and (c) conditions of 1st annealing process using the RTP and oven. The electrical characteristics of the Al-ITZO TFTs depending on \nthe oven and variable RTP (NIR, UV/NIR, DUV/NIR) was summarized on Table 1. To confrm the uniformity, the 32 diferent devices were measured in 6 inch wafer. The mobility was increased from 24.1 cm2/Vs in the oven annealing to the 29.1 cm2/Vs in the DUV/NIR annealing. This phenomenon was related to the Fig. 18a measured X-ray refectivity \n(XRR) results for the Al-IZTO flm annealed at 280 °C in air using oven and RTP (NIR, UV/NIR, and DUV/NIR and (b) summary of calculated density of flms after annealing. The density values of the XRR results were 6.65 and 6.64 g/\ncm3, for ovens and RTP-NIR annealing. In contrast, density increased to 6.71 and 6.87 g/cm3 after UV and DUV, respectively. In general, the density of oxidation semiconductors after heat removal can be described as structural relaxation/ recovery and/or absorption of oxygen to flm, and in this operation, two efects can occur simultaneously . The energy of UV region is sufcient to break unstable chemical bonds, such as weakly coupled atoms and metal/oxygen interaction in the oxide layer . Therefore, UV and DUV can broken the weak-bonds in the Al-ITZO flm, and more efective recovery and structural relaxation occur during the step 2 (RTP annealing with NIR). In addition, under oxidation conditions, during the reduction process, oxygen can be incorporated into the active layer surface to spread to the bulk area, thereby increasing flm density . This efect becomes stronger as when the high-energy light source, DUV is radiated even in low-temperature annealing or annealing at high temperature.\nAmong the various post processing methods, there is also a method using intense pulsed light (IPL) irradiation. \nPark et al.  repots the efects of IPL on the electrical characteristics of ZnON TFTs with diferent irradiation energies. As the irradiation energy of IPL increased 30, 40, 45, and 50 J/cm2 and the wavelength range of the xenon lamp was from 350 to 950 nm. The illustration of the IPL process on ZnON thin flms and TFTs was shown in Fig. 19. The sample was irradiated with IPL with a 20 ms pulse duration. Figure 20 shows (a) the transfer curve of ZnON TFTs depending on the IPL irradiation energy and \n(b) the output curve of 40 J/cm2, respectively. Representative electrical parameters such as threshold voltage (Vth), \nsaturation mobility (*μsat*), and subthreshold swing (SS) are also listed in Table 2. The highest µFE, 48.4 cm2/Vs was achieved and optimized at 40 J/cm2. This degradation contributed to the change in nitrogen-related bonding states, such as nonstoichiometric ZnxNy and N–N bonding, rather than that of oxygen-related bonding states and the atomic composition of ZnON thin flms. These results indicate that optimizing the IPL process allows us to produce highperformance ZnON TFTs very quickly without additional heat treatment, thereby achieving high-productivity TFT manufacturing.\n5 The Mobility Versus Stability Of Aos Tfts\nThere are three main factors that afect the stability of the AOS TFTs. First, the thermal stress (TS), the bias stress (BS) and the illumination stress (IS). In the BS, there are two types of positive bias stress test (PBS) that applies positive voltage and negative bias stress test (NBS) that applies \n![10_image_1.png](10_image_1.png)\n![10_image_0.png](10_image_0.png)\n| Table 1 Summary of transfer    |\n|--------------------------------|\n| properties of the Al-ITZO TFTs |\n| with 1st annealing using oven  |\n| and RTP (NIR, UV/NIR, DUV/     |\n| NIR)                       |\n| Annealing   | Mobility (cm 2 /Vs)   |\n|-------------|-----------------------|\n| Oven (Ref)  | 24.1 ± 1.7            |\n| NIR only    | 27.4 ± 1.6            |\n| UV/NIR      | 28.2 ± 2.4            |\n| DUV/NIR     | 29.1 ± 1.7            |\n| Hysteresis(V) @   | Von (V)      | S.S (V/dec)   |\n|-------------------|--------------|---------------|\n| Vds =0.1 V        |              |               |\n| 0.77 ±0.2         | −0.48 ± 1.02 | 0.11 ± 0.03   |\n| 0.82 ±0.21        | −0.4±0.51    | 0.11 ± 0.016  |\n| 0.84 ± 0.37       | −0.55±0.47   | 0.11 ± 0.02   |\n| 0.62 ±0.16        | −0.41 ± 0.25 | 0.1 ± 0.016   |\n![10_image_2.png](10_image_2.png)\n![10_image_3.png](10_image_3.png)\n| Table 2 Device parameters (averages and standard variations) of   |             |                 |             |                |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|----------------|\n| ZnON TFTs with respect to IPL irradiation energy [ 43 ]           |             |                 |             |                |\n| Energy                                                            | Vth (V)     | Psat (cm 2 /Vs) | SS (V/dec)  | Hysteresis (V) |\n| (J/cm 2 )                                                         |             |                 |             |                |\n| 30                                                                | − 14.70     | 45.65           | 1.13        | 0.98           |\n| 40                                                                | 0.98 ± 1.32 | 48.4 ± 1.33     | 0.26 ±0.05  | 0.38 ± 0.03    |\n| 45                                                                | 1.02±0.119  | 9.00 ± 1.25     | 0.52 ± 0.07 | 1.12 ±0.25     |\n| 4.20 ±0.83                                                        | 1.42 ±0.12  |                 |             |                |\n| 50                                                                | 2.94 ± 0.84 | 0.64 ± 0.07     |             |                |\nnegative voltage into the gate electrode. First of all, we could consider the thermal effect. There is a mechanism for changing V th in the TS test. The lots of electrons in the valance band ( E V ) are moves to the conduction band ( E C ) through the trap states in the channel, when thermal energy from the temperature is affected to the channel layer [ 44 ]. Second, the PBS/NBS instability can be explained using 2 mechanisms, (1) trapping of electrons/holes in the gate dielectric or interface of channel/gate dielectric, or (2) the defects\n![11_image_0.png](11_image_0.png)\n![11_image_1.png](11_image_1.png)\ncreation in the channel material [31, 45, 46]. Third, when the light illuminated to the channel material, the VO in the deep level subgap states photo-ionized to the VO\n2+ with 2 electrons . The stability is Mobility is important, but stability is also as important a parameter as mobility. \nIn other words, two values of optimizing are continuously required. Figure 21 shows the mobility versus stability with various AOS materials as of 2019.\n6 Conclusion\nIt is expected that AOS TFT will be the basis for next-generation industries such as displays, nanomaterials and cars of the future. In particular, high performance and design will be needed gradually as the specifcations required by future applications are increasing. Thus, as discussed in this paper, the following process, which is how to achieve high mobility, should be discussed in more depth. In this paper, we investigated about various ways (materials, structures, post-processing) to achieve high mobility since 2004. Figure 22 shows comprehensive review on the development of µFE during the year by year with whole ways to increase the mobility."

        "text": "Comprehensive Review On The Development Of High Mobility In Oxide Thin Film Transistors\nJun Young Choi Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul 02841, Korea and Research Institute of Advanced Semiconductor Convergence Technology, Cheongju 58503, Korea Sang Yeol Lee∗\nResearch Institute of Advanced Semiconductor Convergence Technology, Cheongju 58503, Korea and Department of Semiconductor Engineering, Cheongju University, Cheongju 28503, Korea\n(Received 11 July 2017)\nOxide materials are one of the most advanced key technology in the thin film transistors (TFTs)\nfor the high-end of device applications. Amorphous oxide semiconductors (AOSs) have leading technique for flat panel display (FPD), active matrix organic light emitting display (AMOLED)\nand active matrix liquid crystal display (AMLCD) due to their excellent electrical characteristics, such as field effect mobility (μF E), subthreshold swing (S.S) and threshold voltage (Vth). Covalent semiconductor like amorphous silicon (a-Si) is attributed to the anti-bonding and bonding states of Si hybridized orbitals. However, AOSs have not grain boundary and excellent performances originated from the unique characteristics of AOS which is the direct orbital overlap between s orbitals of neighboring metal cations. High mobility oxide TFTs have gained attractive attention during the last few years and today in display industries. It is progressively developed to increase the mobility either by exploring various oxide semiconductors or by adopting new TFT structures. Mobility of oxide thin film transistor has been rapidly increased from single digit to higher than 100 cm2/V·s in a decade. In this review, we discuss on the comprehensive review on the mobility of oxide TFTs in a decade and propose bandgap engineering and novel structure to enhance the electrical characteristics of oxide TFTs.\nAmorphous oxide semiconductors (AOSs) incorporating an active channel layer have been intensively attractive attention for their high mobility, good visible region transparency, and amorphous structure. Due to their special conduction mechanism, high mobility can be achieved even in the amorphous phase. Recently, further improvement of the mobility is required for the realization of next generation flat panel displays (FPDs), such as large-area ultra-definition (UD) and 3-dimensional\n(3D) displays [1–3]. High mobility oxide thin film transistors (TFTs) have been largely investigated. Many groups attempt to increase the electrical properties by modifying gate insulator, electrode, active channel layers, and TFT\nstructure [4–8]. The next generation display backplane industrials need to improve the mobility and the stability of oxide TFTs. Mobility is particularly important char-\nTFTs performance needs to demand much higher mobility (> 30 cm2/V·s). It is not so easy to achieve by modifying the conventional amorphous Si (a-Si). Low temperature poly silicon (LTPS) TFTs has exhibits a more sufficient electrical characteristics into display industrials than the a-Si. For mobile application, LTPS\nTFTs has well optimized [9–11]. However, the LTPS TFT has a not appropriate large size application due to the grain boundary and non-uniformity. Mobility of oxide thin film transistor has been rapidly increased from single digit to higher than 100 cm2/V·s in a decade. High mobility TFT has investigated not only display application but an inverter, a non-volatile memory and various sensors [12–16]. Among major components in a TFT, active channel layer plays an important role because it manipulates the conductance of the semiconducting channel, hence, it is now increasingly important to discover Comprehensive Review on the Development of High Mobility··· - Jun Young Choi and Sang Yeol Lee -517-\nhow to exploit active channel material properties to realize the well-balanced ultimate TFT performance. In this article, we present a comprehensive review of recent progress in the development of AOSs TFTs to highperformance electronic devices in a decade and propose novel structure to enhance the mobility of oxide thin film transistor.\nIi. Amorphous Oxide Tfts For High Mobility\nTo obtain meaningful extracted TFT electrical parameter, it has to carefully normalize using an analytical equation. As shown in Fig. 1, assuming an n-type semiconductor, a positive gate voltage (VG) electrostatically induces the polarization of a given gate dielectric while electrons are accumulated at the semiconductordielectric interface. In the linear regime, for low drain voltage, mobility of the TFT is deduced from following\nequation, $\\,$ . \n$$\\mu(V_{G S}-V_{T})={\\frac{i_{D S}}{V_{D S}C_{i}W/L}}$$\nwhere W and L are the channel width and length, respectively, Ci the areal dielectric capacitance, μF E the semiconductor field-effect mobility, VGS the gate voltage referenced to the source electrode, and VT the threshold voltage. In the saturation regime (VDS - VGS−VT ), the TFT field effect mobility using the following equation,\n$$\\mu(V_{G S}-V_{T})^{2}=\\frac{I_{D S}}{c_{i}W/2L}$$\n$$\\left({2\\atop)}\\right)$$\nMobility of a TFT can be extracted using different methodologies from the transconductance (gm) =\n∂IDS/∂VGS with low VDS as following equation,\n$$e={\\frac{g_{m}}{c_{O X}(W/L)V_{D S}}}$$\nwhere COX is either the bottom or top gate oxide capacitance per unit area. We have summarized the development on high mobility oxide TFT in about a decade in Fig. 2. There are many reports on the mobility enhancement of oxide TFTs and it is clear to observe the results showing that the mobility is increased continuously. Since amorphous indium gallium zinc oxide (aIGZO) was reported by Hosono *et al*., it has been intensively studied to use a-IGZO for active channel layer . Although the a-IGZO has a good electrical property, the performance such as mobility value for the implementation of next-generation display like ultra-definition panel of IGZO TFTs was not sufficient to apply integrating driver circuit . Wager *et al*. . achieved high mobility of 25 cm2/V·s TFT using ZTO for device post-annealed at 600 ◦C in the year of 2005. These materials are extra example of possibility of high performance active channel layer using amorphous oxide semiconductors. Subsequently, many multi-component oxide TFTs fabricated by various materials and structure have been reported. H. Q. Chiang *et al*.  report high transparency and high mobility of 53 cm2/V·s IZO\nTFT annealed at 600 ◦C in 2005. This channel has amorphous structure for annealing temperatures up to 500 ◦C and polycrystalline at 600 ◦C by X-ray diffraction analysis. However, high annealing temperature offers better electrical properties to oxide active channel layer while we should control processing temperature and threshold voltage in order to apply display application. T. Hirao group  reported high performance top gate c-axis oriented polycrystalline ZnO TFTs with high mobility of ∼ 50 cm2/V·s using silicon nitride (SiNx) dielectric deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) and first demonstrated a 1.46\" diagonal AM-LCD driven by ZnO-TFTs. Maximum processing temperature of the ZnO-TFT was 250 ◦C. The polycrystalline structure has the grain boundary which induces unstable electrical properties due to the trap state in grain boundary . Amorphous structure shows lots of advantages, such as no grain boundary, smooth surface, usually low temperature. The control of processing temperature is very important and meaningful especially to the application of flat panel displays on glass based or flexible based substrates. E. Fortunato *et al*. \nreported high mobility of 22.7 cm2/V·s TFT on amorphous structure using IZO channel at room temperature. It is interesting to note that C-C Wu *et al*. \nreported that by simply reducing the oxide thickness, ZnO active channel layer showed high field effect mobility of 25 cm2/V·s. They chose amorphous structure because AOS has no grain boundary and high mobility.\nC. S. Hwang *et al*.  changed the channel deposition pressure. They reported the mobility of the TFT increased to a value as high as 21.8 cm2/V·s in the year of 2008. The gate dielectric is also an important factor that is critical in determining mobility. There are many reports on adopting various gate insulators, especially high-k gate dielectrics. X. Y. Jiang *et al*. \nuse Ta2O5 films as the gate dielectric. The device shows a field effect mobility of 40.5 cm2/V·s using ZnO as a channel in TFT. A. Chin *et al*.  used different highk gate dielectric of HfLaO. High field effect mobility of 25 cm2/V·s was achieved. From the year of 2011, field effect mobility of oxide TFTs was dramatically increased.\nG. Adamopouslos *et al*.  reported that high mobility TFT using Li-doped ZnO based on high-k gate dielectric, exhibiting high mobility over 80 cm2/V·s. High mobility over 100 cm2/V·s are achieved by using amorphous oxide TFT. H-W Zan et al  reported in fabricating a high mobility of 160 cm2/V·s AOS TFTs by capping a strong reduction layer. S. Im *et al*.  also fabricated high performance simple processed a-IZO with high mobility of 116 cm2/V·s TFTs.\nIii. Tft Operation And Design Concept\nAOSs, including indium gallium zinc oxide (Hosono et al., 2004), zinc tin oxide (Wager *et al*. 2005) and indium zinc oxide (Dehuff *et al*. 2005) have been made in AOSs TFT device research for next generation flat panel display applications due to their excellent performances originated from the unique characteristic. Early 1990s, FPDs were fabricated by conventional semiconductor such as Si, GaAs, InP and GaN. The application of polycrystalline ZnO (poly-ZnO), InO and Sn-doped In2O3 to TFTs have been studied as active channel layer specifically for the use in high performance TFT replacements for amorphous silicon in the late 1990s [33–35]. In 2004, Nomura *et al*. demonstrate the room-temperature fabrication of transparent, flexible TFT and high mobility (8.3 cm2/V·s). Flat panel display (FPD) industrial focused on the oxide thin film transistor using active channel layer. At present, a number of oxide TFTs have been developed and are widely used as alternatives to the conventional a-Si semiconductor layer. Their high mobility and large area uniformity such as the 70\" 3D\nUD LCD TV with 240 Hz demonstrated by Samsung Electronics in 2010 . Hosono *et al*. reported transparent and flexible thin film transistor using amorphous In-Ga-Zn-O in 2004. In various flat panel display industry, the development research of high performance transistor is necessary in order to realize high resolution in large size. Post-transition metal cations with (n − 1)\nd10ns0 (n ≥ 4) electronic configurations constitute an interesting subcategory of transparent conductors, since they possess relatively high electron mobilities despite their amorphous character [37–41]. Such high mobilities in an amorphous material are likely a consequence of a conduction band primarily derived from spherically symmetric, post-transition metal cation ns orbitals. Such orbitals have large radii, leading to a high degree of overlap between adjacent orbitals and considerable band dispersion. Moreover, the spherical symmetry of an s orbital makes delocalized electronic transport less sensitive to local and extended structural order as compared with band formation from anisotropic p or d orbitals. Furthermore, compared to binary oxide semiconductors, multicomponent oxide semiconductors increase the likelihood that the structure will remain amorphous over a wide range of processing conditions. Various oxide materials have been investigated as candidates of metal-oxide semiconductors. Design concept of IGZO has started to investigate oxide materials act as active channel layer in TFTs. There are three concept of fabrication of oxide thin film transistor (Network former, mobility enhancer and carrier generation or suppressor). Zn2+ act as network former has stabilized amorphous structure of metal oxide which was valence compound with a high degree of iconicity with a small electron effective mass\n. However ZnO TFT has grain boundary and high concentration of residual free electron due to the native defect. To solve this problem, carrier suppressor used to decrease native defect such as oxygen vacancy and zinc interstitials. Hf4+, Zr4+, Mg2+, Si4+ have high bonding strength and high electronegativity with binding and capturing oxygen, respectively [43–46]. By incorporating carrier suppressor, carrier density of oxide materials was controlled. Mobility enhancer as electron path way former are used in In3+ which has a heavy posttransition metal cation with a large principal quantum number (n = 5) with the conduction band bottom (the pathway for conduction electrons) . The addition of In3+ enhances the mobility due to the extensive overlapping of neighboring s-orbitals originating in the oxide materials and the Fermi level (EF ) is to be upper side in conduction band minimum (CBM) due to the high carrier concentration of In2O3. So, we can easily investigate multicomponent amorphous oxides by using three design concepts. J. K. Jeong *et al*.  report the effect of the indium contents on the electrical property of the a-IGZO TFT. The widely explored oxide TFT such Comprehensive Review on the Development of High Mobility··· - Jun Young Choi and Sang Yeol Lee -519-\nas IGZO, ZTO has multi-combination of cations. It has been reported that IGZO TFT has the optimization of the cation composition in AOS. Composition of each elements and effects on TFT characteristics has been actively studied. The effect of adding Ga content to IZO\nhas increased optical gap energy, the turn-on voltage and potential barrier height . Gallium has strong bond strength with oxygen, suppressing the generation of oxygen vacancy which is caused by oxygen ion missing from oxide films. There has been several reports on ZTO TFT\nof the electrical characteristic. For ZTO TFT, The electron concentration is easily controlled by the oxygen (O)-\ndeficiency, however by which a lot of deep levels within band gap are generated, leading to the instability of the device operation, especially under light. For the stable device operation, the controls of the optimal O-deficiency and the deep state formation are demanding. It is suggested that these could be modulated by suitably carriersuppressor [51–54]\nIv. Tft Configuration And Structure Modification\nOxide TFTs are named by constructing location of three components, namely, the active channel layer, the source and drain electrode, the gate dielectrics. Figure 3 shows a number of TFT structures according to the position of three components. A coplanar TFT,\nthe gate dielectrics, active channel layer and source and drain electrode are on the same side of the semiconductor. Therefore, the plasma damage to the gate electrode during gate dielectric deposition to minimized. In case of inverted coplanar structure, the active channel layer surface is exposed to air can deteriorate the electrical property due to the ambient effect however this structure can easily modify its properties by surface treatments. The widely used structure for the fabrication of TFT has been staggered bottom-gate structure. The gate electrode was first formed on the substrate, and gate dielectric, active channel layer, source/drain electrode are deposited sequentially. Because the back channel surface effect is exposure by atmosphere and can suffer damage from source and drain pattering process. In order to prevent these problems, the back channel etched\n(BCE) structure or the etch stopper (ES) structure are applied to the TFTs . Staggered structure has the gate electrode and source/drain electrics on opposite sides of the semiconductor. This structure has some advantage in that the upper gate dielectrics and electrode protect the active channel layer from damage. In addition to these conventional structures, dual gate structure, buried-layer structure, and superlattice structure has been studied to improve the electrical properties [57–\n59]. Theses structure for high performance and reliability oxide TFTs were summarized in Fig. 4. Dual gate thin film transistor (DGTFT) was deposited on the active channel layer which located between the source and drain contacts. An additional gate can control to set as a function of applied gate bias. DGTFT structure will allow achieving both a high device electrical performance and stable operation under illumination. The electrical performance of DGTFTs was improved because a larger portion of the channel area is controlled by an additional gate electrode. Also, the highly-doped buried TFT has been reported for TFTs to obtain high stability and performance. Highly doped additional active layer buried at the interface between the active channel layer and the dielectric can improve the stability and the mobility since the suggested instability mechanism is the oxygen adsorption and carrier trapping/detrapping on the backinterface and the gate-interface between channel layer and gate-insulator, respectively. Superlattice structure consisting of three-period ZnO and Al2O3 has been reported to show high mobility and high electrical stability. Superlattice structure showed improved field effect mobility of the TFT exhibited higher value than that of the conventional single ZnO TFT, due to the high carrier mobility along the in-plane direction by the electrons confined in ZnO layers, as well as the high crystal quality.\nIn contrast, the ZnO layers in the ZnO/Al2O3 superlattice showed improved crystalline phase with relatively caxis preferred orientation by inserting thin Al2O3 layers, where the Al2O3 layers promoted layer-by-layer growth of the ZnO layers. As a result, the field effect mobility of the superlattice TFT exhibited higher value than that of the conventional single ZnO TFT, due to the high carrier mobility along the in-plane direction by the electrons confined in ZnO layers, as well as the high crystal quality.\nAlso, the ZnO/Al2O3 superlattice channel including the ZnO with high crystallinity induced considerably high electrical stability, due to the low defect density in the superlattice channel and the passivation effect of Al2O3.\nV. Recent Progress In Metal Oxide Tft For High Mobility And Stability 1. Engineering Of Electrical Structure\nThe origin of the defect state was involved with the creation of oxygen vacancies (VO). Carrier generation could modify the position of the Fermi level within the band gap of the oxide thin film. To design a highperformance device, the structure of the interface between the metal electrode and active thin-film channel layer must be optimised, so an exact analysis of the energy band gap of the thin film is necessary. However, because of the difficulties in deriving the relationship between the stability and Fermi level of the oxide band gap, the study of this issue has remained very limited until now. Numerous studies have reported AOS TFTs with several multicomponent oxide semiconductors, such as InGaZnO, ZnSnO, and HfGaZnO. Recently, indium free materials, like ZTO, have been extensively studied for the use of active channel layer of TFTs. Oxide-based multicomponent semiconductors have several advantages over conventional Si-based semiconductors, such as visible light transparency, large area deposition at low temperature, and high carrier mobility. For ZTO TFTs, the high mobility comes from an increase in the population of charge carriers (electrons) originating from oxygen vacancies. However, too many deep trap levels within the band gap can lead to instability of the device during operation, such as large off currents and a depletion mode with a large threshold voltage shift [60–62]. For high performance and stable device operation, it is important to optimize the O-deficiency and deep state formation [63–\n66]. In previous report, the O-deficiency can be more easily controlled by Si-incorporation. The fabricated TFTs with amorphous silicon-zinc-tin-oxide (a-SZTO) channel layer showed an excellent stable device operation. Silicon (799.6 kj/mol) has higher bonding energy with oxygen than Zn (159 kj/mol), Sn (531.8 kj/mol) as a result the O-deficiency can be significantly suppressed. Therefore, doping with Si atoms can be a strategy to enhance the electrical characteristics as well as the device stability. Investigation of the basic semiconducting properties, such as the Fermi-level and energy band gap configuration, including the position of the VBM and the CBM are key properties related to the carrier concentration and the mobility of the films for AOS TFT operation. To investigate the effect of Si doping on the ZTO semiconductor, the energy band diagrams were carefully derived by combining the results of KP, UPS, and HR-EELS measurements\nA. Chemical Composition\nXPS studies were carried out to analyze the chemical composition of the Si doping ZTO thin films. Figure 5(a)\nshows the O1s XPS spectra with Si ratio. The binding energy of photoelectrons was calibrated using the C1s Comprehensive Review on the Development of High Mobility··· - Jun Young Choi and Sang Yeol Lee -521-\npeak at 284.25 eV as a reference. The O1s peak on the surface was fitted by three Gaussians peaks; labelled\n(OI ), (OII ), and (OIII ). The lowest energy sub-peak\n(OI ) at 530.25 eV was assigned to the oxygen-binding region of the matrix without oxygen vacancies, and the medium energy sub-peak (OII ) at 531.62 eV is associated with the oxygen-deficient regions . The highest energy sub-peak (OIII ) at 532.5 eV is related to the metal hydroxide peak . The density of the oxygen-deficient bonding state (OII ) decreased with increasing Si ratio, as shown by the relative ratios of the OII peak in Fig. 4(b).\nThis result clearly indicates that the concentration of oxygen vacancies (VO) decreased, probably resulting in a decrease in the carrier concentration with increasing Si content. Even though the individual contribution of VO\nto the electrical performance was not quantified precisely, the formation of VO results in the generation of charge carriers due to the increase of free electrons, explained by the electron charge trapping model.\nB. Calculated Band-Alignment Energy Diagrams\nTo obtain further insight into the band gap structure of SZTO TFTs with different Si ratios, a typical valence band was measured by UPS. He (II) UPS spectra are shown in Fig. 5. The secondary electron cut-off energy\n(SC) and the valence band edge energy (E*V BE*) were derived using a linear extrapolation of the leading edges to the backgrounds of the spectra. From these extracted values, the valence band energies were obtained analo-\ngously using Eq.$\\,\\,$ (1) , . \nValenceband $=h\\nu-(SC-E_{VBE})$ . \nValenceband = hν − (SC − E*V BE*) (4)\nwhere hν is the incident He (II) line energy at 40.813 eV  and EVBE is defined as the energy separation between the VBM edge and the Fermi level. It is clear that the valence band spectra changed with Si doping of the SZTO system. In order to elucidate the origin of the observed band-gap changes, HR-EELS spectra were obtained using a 1.5 keV exciting electron beam, as shown in Fig. 6(a). HR-EELS is capable of analysing electronic and optical properties of oxide materials because the lowenergy-loss region reflects the valence and conduction band structures of solids. All spectra showed a strong elastic peak, followed by a flat and featureless region and then a broad energy loss peak. The onset of the energy loss peak in the spectrum gives the energy gap corresponding to that particular scattering geometry. The band-gaps of films ZTO, 0.3ZTO, and 0.5SZTO were estimated by the linear fit method (Fig. 6(b)), yielding values of 3.88, 4.11, and 4.21 eV, respectively. As the Si ratio increased, the bandgap widened. We also used KP\nto measure the work function of SZTO thin films, where the measured contact potential difference was calibrated using an in situ sputtered Au reference sample .\nThe valence band and band gap values calculated from UPS and HR-EELS allowed us to estimate the position of the conduction band (Ec) . The experimentally determined band gaps are shown in Fig. 6. Comparing the carrier concentrations, the Fermi level of ZTO was located much closer to the CBM than that of 0.3ZTO\nand 0.5ZTO. The difference between the CBM and the Fermi level of the system became larger as the Si concentration increased. This clearly indicates the decrease of carrier concentration with doping. Weaker bonds require less energy to break and to stimulate an electron to the conduction level. Therefore, we can control the electrical performance of a channel device by simply doping with Si, which acts as an oxygen vacancy suppressor and results in a lower carrier concentration . This can be attributed to the tight bonding forces between Si and oxygen that suppress the creation of donor-like oxygen vacancies in the system .\n2. Metal Capping Structure\nBy adopting metal layer on the active channel layer\n(with a length as 40 μm) between source and drain center of the channel region, drain current-crowding and the carrier scattering effect is reduced due to the metal capping layer which has lower resistance than oxide channel layer. Increased electron velocity (speed of electron injection from source to drain through channel layer)\nhas less influenced charge trapping between active channel layer and gate dielectric because the current path has been formed through metal capping layer. Capping 55-522-\nstructure involves a protective layer on top of the active channel layer after to forming the source/drain deposition. By adopting metal layer on the active channel layer between source and drain center of the channel region, drain current-crowding and the carrier scattering effect is reduced due to the metal capping layer which has lower resistance than oxide channel layer. This structure has shown high µ F E as well as enhanced stability simply by adopting MC-layer. Additionally, proposed devices effectively prevent the adsorption/desorption reaction of ambient oxygen and hydrogen molecules on the surface.\nThe schematic configuration of the conventional structure and metal capping structure TFT has been shown in Figs. 7(a) - (d) It has back-channel bottom-gate structure and a gap-spacing of 5 µ m between metal capping layer and top-electrodes (source and drain). This struc-\nComprehensive Review on the Development of High Mobility··· - Jun Young Choi and Sang Yeol Lee -523-\nture has shown high field effect mobility (μF E) of exceeding 147.6 cm2/V·s as well as enhanced stability simply by adopting MC-layer. This improvement with adopting MC-layer is attributed to form strongly compacted ω-shape current-path by tunneling effect (the low effective barrier height leads to the low contact resistance)\nas a result of effective control of the surface potential by coupling effect and low-resistance of MC-layer in channel region .\nFigures 7(e) and (f) show the hysteresis in the forward and reverse bias without metal capping layer and with metal capping layer, respectively. Forward and reverse gate bias was applied from −20 to 40 V and from 40 V\nto −20 V, respectively. It is clearly observed that the off-current was not changed because MC-layer was not directly contact with source and drain electrode. For the detailed investigation, we performed the comparison between the simulation of current density of conventional and MC-TFTs. The total current-density simulation and schematic current-path for CON-, 20MP,\n30MP and 40MP-TFT illustrated in Figs. 8(a) - (d), respectively. The current flows toward low-resistance region because MC-layer has lower-resistance than active channel layer. MC-layer has absolutely low resistance\n(T i ≈ 10−5 Ω/cm)  than SZTO channel layer. Due to the low-resistance, current path was developed like percolation conduction mechanism and changed like ωshape. In solid state physics, the effect carrier mobility is using the following relation: μ = eτ/m∗ where τ is the mean scattering time and m∗ is the effective mass  MC-layer decreased the collision between the free electrons and interface trap states due to the ω-shape current-path and also supply the charge carriers to form the well localized current-path, as a result MC-layer should increase the average scattering time.\nThe MC-TFT enhances performance more than the conventional structure TFTs even for the same carrier concentration. When the potential voltage occurs at active channel layer, the downward band-bending induced charged defect state at channel layer was prevented by MC-layer . This means the current-path mainly formed following MC-layer like ω-shape because a lowresistance of MC-layer plays the critical role of supplying sufficiently negative charge carriers to compensate the amount of positive charge induced by the increase of VGS.\nMore importantly, the ω-shape current-path less affected by interface trap site (It). Even though the channellayer capacitance and gate-insulator capacitance change along the gate-voltage as well as potential voltage value, the effect of variation of potential voltage less affected the performance of MC-TFTs due to the current-path formed in MC-layer. In order to demonstrate the effect of MC layer, the transfer characteristics of the other active channel layer such as IGZO, ZTO TFTs shows in Fig. 9.\nThe identical process oxide TFT both conventional and MC layer indicate that the device electrical properties of MC TFT shown better performance than conventional structure. It is noteworthy that the electrical properties of the MC layer TFTs are improved. The field effect mobility of IGZO and ZTO TFT applied MC layer show 22.7 V·cm−1s−1, 56.8 V·cm−1s−1, respectively. It indicates that MC layer can improve the electrical properties due to the ω-shape current flow which are less affected by trap state between gate insulator and active channel layer.\n3. Organic/Inorganic Hybrid Gate Dielectric\nOrganic dielectric materials, such as polyvinyalcohol (PVA), polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and polystyrene (PS) can satisfy demands specific to organic gate dielectric [84–89].\nOrganic dielectric materials could be compatible with flexible substrate and sustain larger strain because the molecules in them are linked through van der Waals bond. In addition, polymer dielectrics can often be formed by simple and low-cost fabrication processes, such as printing, casting and spin-coating at room temperature and under ambient conditions. Various organic materials have been investigated as candidates of polymer gate dielectrics. The characteristics of organic materials can be modified by design of the monomer precursors and polymerization reaction conditions, which offer more application opportunities in a wide range of electronic devices. In the case of AOS TFTs, sputter deposition is widely used. However, high energy sputtered particles easily induce damage on the pre-deposited layers, such as the organic gate dielectrics in bottom gated TFTs. Sputtering-induced damages even on flexible organic gate dielectrics gives rise to leakage current in TFTs . Inorganic dielectric layer, such as SiO2, which is the most widely used gate dielectric are vulnerable to mechanical stress despite the high deposition temperature for high quality film by PECVD and they can fail easily by cracking or delamination during large mechanical deformation. The high processing temperatures of over 250 ◦C reached during the post-annealing and/or passivation processes are critical barriers to the use of flexible plastic substrates, such as polycarbonate, polyether sulfone, and polyethylene terephthalate that require processing temperatures below 150 ◦C. By taking advantage of the low processing temperature (< 150 ◦C)\nand optimizing the processing steps, we achieved a hybrid gate dielectric of organic and inorganic film layers.\nHence, inorganic dielectric materials strongly bonded to organic dielectric materials have been proposed for bottom gated oxide TFTs. Therefore, the improvement of gate dielectric materials in flexible oxide TFTs by hybridization of organic and inorganic materials has become of great interest. Bottom-gate SIZO based TFTs with a PVP and Al2O3 hybrid gate dielectric were fabricated on PI substrate as shown in Fig. 10 In order to protect the active channel layer from water vapor and hydrogen in the air, the PMMA, MicroChem A4) layer was deposited over the channel layer by spin coating as a passivation layer, followed by baking 60 ◦C for 2 hrs.\non the hot plate. The film roughness is important to improve electrical properties, such as μF E and SS. Smooth surface roughness of the dielectric layer on flexible substrates may be attributed to the presence of little interfacial trap states at the interface between semiconductor and gate dielectric . It is interesting to observe that the SIZO TFTs with a single PVP gate dielectric layer did not show transfer characteristics mainly due to the plasma damage on the PVP surface during the sputtering, resulting in a high source-gate leakage current of a few micro amperes (μA). To minimize the sputtering damage, a 20-nm-thick Al2O3 film was additionally deposited on the PVP layer before forming the active layer.\nIn this case, the source-gate leakage current shows a level of nano amperes. The source-gate leakage currents of single PVP and organic/inorganic hybrid gate dielectric have been shown in Fig. 10. The organic/inorganic hybrid gate dielectric samples showed much lower leakage current for comparable capacitance density. This clearly verifies the advantage of organic/inorganic hybrid gate dielectric over conventional gate dielectrics. Smooth surface roughness of gate dielectric was an important prerequisite for obtaining large μF E, since the sources of scattering should be considered, such as Coulomb scattering from interface states or surface roughness scattering. Moreover, rough surface roughness resulted in the degradation of SS due to the generation of many trap between active channel layer and gate insulator. When the surface roughness increased, the SS value is proportionally decreased. The degradation of SS on poor surface roughness owes to trapped charge relaxation in channel during VGS sweeping [92–94]. Rolland *et al*. have reported that the SS is highly related to the defect density of the insulator/semiconductor interface . It is well known that the SS value is dependent on the total trap density in the bulk channel layer and the trap between active channel layer and gate dielectric (Dit). The decrease in SS with increasing surface roughness could be mainly attributed to the increase of the interface trap density.\nComprehensive Review on the Development of High Mobility . . . - Jun Young C HOI and Sang Yeol L EE\nIn summary, the last decade has been great progress in oxide based TFTs. Display industry still need the good electrical properties, such as high field effect mobility and stability.  The oxide TFT is a great candidate for the backplane for next generation display application. The vision for oxide TFT is a high field effect mobility that can be a cornerstone for high speed and high-end device applications.  In order to improve the stability of oxide TFTs, robust oxide compound, stable structure, and post treatment are required. We envision that the future development of oxide TFT will be accelerated when the understanding of fundamental material aspects. In order to improve stability and electrical performances, we introduced Si-doped oxide materials. Then we presented MC structure or organic/inorganic hybrid gate dielectric structure for oxide TFTs.  The electrical properties have been improved by adopting MC-layer with pristine channel layer. It is attributed the strongly compacted ω -shape current-path as a result of the control of surface potential by coupling effect and superb low-resistance of MC-layer as channel region. Such a demonstration is successfully achieved in the fabrication of TFTs and studied to elucidate the mechanism responsible for the behavior of these devices in particular and of amorphous\nand the Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy (MOTIE)\nof the Republic of Korea (No.20172010104940) and the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (NRF-2017R1D1A3B06033837).\n M.

Kim,b S.-m. Ryu,b J. H. Lim*c and D.-K. Choi*ab We have developed a new technique to fabricate coplanar homojunction structure a-IGZO thin film transistors (TFTs) by adopting selective ultraviolet (UV) irradiation in the n+ source/drain regions of an a-IGZO layer through a patterned photoresist mask. In order to apply this technique for coplanar homojunction a-IGZO TFTs, we systematically studied the effect of dual wavelength (185 nm and 254 nm) UV irradiation time on the conductivity of a-IGZO films. Various materials were evaluated to find one that provided proper shielding against UV irradiation. The resistivity of the a-IGZO film drastically decreased from an as-deposited value of 2.71  106 U cm to 3.76  105 U cm after UV irradiation. The lowest resistivity obtained in this study is similar to that of ITO transparent electrodes and is about 2 orders of magnitude lower than the values obtained to date. Coplanar homojunction a-IGZO TFTs were successfully fabricated by introducing an optimized process that included UV irradiation through a patterned photoresist UV mask. The saturation mobility (msat), threshold voltage (Vth), sub-threshold swing (SS), and on/off current ratio (Ion/Ioff) were measured to be 6.7 cm2 V1 s, 7.3 V, 0.21 V per decade, and 109, respectively. Moreover, we showed that the UV irradiation technique provided both a low contact resistance due to the high conductivity in the source/drain region and a small channel length modulation due to non-thermal doping behavior. We believe that this UV irradiation process is a useful technique because it is simple and results in outstanding electrical properties.\nAmorphous InGaZnO (a-IGZO) TFTs have attracted attention for application in active-matrix liquid crystal displays and activematrix organic light emitting diode displays due to their high mobility, low sub-threshold swing, low leakage current and good large-area uniformity in comparison with amorphous silicon TFTs. A bottom gate structure has been widely employed for a-IGZO TFTs.1–4 However, the bottom gate structure has a high parasitic capacitance including gate-to-drain and gate-tosource due to overlap between the gate and source/drain electrodes. These parasitic capacitances eventually lead to signal resistance–capacitance (RC) delay in the TFT backplane of highresolution large-area displays.\nIn order to overcome this problem, many research groups have studied coplanar structured a-IGZO TFTs, which can minimize the overlap between the gate and the source/drain electrodes.5–8 Authors of these reports proposed the formation of an n+-doped a-IGZO lm on the source/drain contact regions by selective exposure to Ar, He, and H2 plasma ambient.5,9,10 High conductivity can also be achieved by hydrogen diffusion into the a-IGZO lm during plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) of silicon nitride (SiNx) or silicon oxide (SiOx), which provide an etch stopper layer or a passivation layer.11 However, the n+ doping process using plasma treatment is rather complicated, and channel region may become narrow because hydrogen diffuses to channel region during the process due to high diffusivity.10 The effect of UV irradiation on the conductivity of a-IGZO lms was investigated in a previous report. In that report, a-IGZO TFTs with a dual active layer were fabricated by inserting an embedded conductive layer using photo-chemical doping of the a-IGZO lm by UV irradiation.\nThe photo-chemical n+-doped a-IGZO channel showed an increase in carrier concentration of 1018 cm3 from the background level of 1016 cm3, and the overall characteristics of the TFT were improved as well.12 In this study, we investigated the effect of UV irradiation time on the resistivity of a-IGZO lms and evaluated shielding materials for selective doping in the a-IGZO active layer. Then, we optimized a simple photo-chemical doping technique to fabricate coplanar homojunction a-IGZO TFTs. In addition to the superior electrical characteristics of a-IGZO TFTs fabricated using the UV irradiation process, we also demonstrated the advantage of the selective UV irradiation method over the other methods by estimating the contact resistance (Rsd) and channel length modulation (DL) using a transmission line method (TLM).\nIn order to evaluate the effect of UV irradiation time on conductivity of IGZO lm, we varied the irradiation time from 1 to 3 h. We also evaluated candidate masking material such as SiOx, AlOx and negative and positive photoresist (hereaer, denoted as NPR and PPR, respectively). Finally, we fabricated a coplanar homojunction a-IGZO TFTs employing the UV irradiation process as shown schematics in Fig. 1. 100 nm-thick Mo layer was deposited as the gate electrode by direct current (DC)\nsputtering with a DC power of 80 W and working pressure of 4 mTorr in an Ar ambient. These gate electrodes were patterned by using photolithography and a wet etching process. SiNx and SiO2 were sequentially deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) at 250 C to form a SiNx (100 nm)/\nSiO2 (40 nm) bi-layer as a gate insulator. Then, a 50 nm-thick a-IGZO (In : Ga : Zn ¼ 1 : 1 : 1 mol ratio) layer was deposited at room temperature by radio frequency (RF) sputtering with a RF power of 40 W at a working pressure of 5 mTorr using a gas with a Ar : O2 ¼ 90 : 10 mix ratio. Aer the a-IGZO active layer was patterned by photolithography and wet etching, a nitrogen annealing process was performed in a furnace for 1 h at 300 C.\nTo form the n+ a-IGZO source/drain region, a 1.8 mm-thick patterned positive photo-resist (PPR) was used as a UV masking layer. Then, the sample was exposed to UV light with a xed intensity of 10.8 mW cm2 for 3 h. A typical UV cleaning apparatus was used to provide the UV irradiation at wavelengths of 185 and 254 nm. Finally, a 100 nm-thick layer of Mo was deposited using DC sputtering, and the source and drain electrodes were patterned using a li-off method. The electrical properties of UV treated a-IGZO lms and coplanar homojunction a-IGZO TFTs were evaluated by current–voltage (I–V)\nmeasurements performed using an Agilent E5270B parameter analyzer.\nResults And Discussion\nirradiation time. The resistivity of the as-deposited a-IGZO lm was 2.71  106 U cm. The resistivity drastically dropped over the rst 2 h and then levelled off thereaer. The resistivity (3.76 105 U cm) obtained aer UV irradiation for 3 h is similar to that of ITO transparent electrodes (104 to 105 U cm).\nMany research groups have introduced various plasma treatment techniques and diffusion of hydrogen or uorine into a-IGZO lm using a PECVD process to decrease the resistivity.6,10,13,14 As shown in Table 1, the resistivity obtained by UV\nirradiation is signicantly lower than those achieved for plasma-based n+ a-IGZO formation techniques previously reported. In the plasma-related techniques, the resistivity of a-IGZO lms was all in the range of 103 U cm. The resistivities obtained from direct plasma treatment with Ar,9 H2, 10 and He5 were 2.93  103 U cm, 4.8  103 U cm and 2.79  103 U cm, respectively, while the resistivity obtained from hydrogen diffusion during SiNx 11 deposition by PECVD process was 6.20 103 U cm. Previous investigators have claimed that plasma treatment with H2, He, or Ar creates oxygen vacancies via bond breaking between metal and oxygen in a-IGZO.7,9,10,16 In our previous study, we fabricated a-IGZO TFT with high mobility by \"permanent photo-chemical doping\" via UV irradiation. The UV irradiation is known to break metal-oxide bonds and generate the charged oxygen vacancy such as Vo\nfrom Vo neutral vacancy in oxide semiconductor. These phenomenon provide free electrons in oxide semiconductor, which leads to increase of carrier concentration.12,17 This UV\nirradiation technique is attractive because it is performed at room temperature in air ambient using commercially available UV cleaning equipment. Moreover, the line-of-sight nature of the UV exposure is advantageous for fabrication of coplanar\n| Method                 | Resistivity (U cm)   | Ref.      |\n|------------------------|----------------------|-----------|\n| SiNx : H               | 6.20  103                      | 11        |\n| H2 plasma treatment    | 4.8  103                      | 10        |\n| Ar plasma treatment    | 2.93  103                      | 9         |\n| He plasma treatment    | 2.79  103                      | 5         |\n| UV irradiation for 3 h | 3.76  105                      | This work |\nA proper masking material is required in order to dene the source/drain region in a coplanar homojunction TFT. We evaluated candidate masking materials including SiOx, AlOx and negative and positive photoresist (i.e., NPR and PPR, respectively). The thicknesses were 100 nm, 100 nm and 1.8 mm, respectively, which were chosen based on the typical values used in conventional TFT fabrication processes. Aer the UV\nshielding layer was deposited onto the a-IGZO layer, the sample was exposed to UV light for 3 h, which was followed by measurement of the resulting resistivity (Fig. 3). The 100 nm thick SiOx stacked a-IGZO lm showed a resistivity of 1.41 104 U cm aer UV exposure; this resistivity is almost the same as that of unshielded a-IGZO aer UV irradiation (3.76  105 U cm). The resistivity was measured to be 1.63  101 U cm for the AlOx layer aer UV exposure. Even though this value is about three orders of magnitude higher than that of the SiOx stacked a-IGZO lm, the AlOx layer is still transparent to UV irradiation.\nInterestingly, the resistivities of PPR and NPR stacked a-IGZO\nlms turned out to be 5.62  105 U cm and 4.09  105 U cm, respectively, aer UV exposure. These values are close to the resistivity of the as-deposited a-IGZO lm (2.71  106 U cm).\nTherefore, a simple process of selective UV irradiation through a patterned PR shielding layer can be effective in the fabrication of coplanar homojunction a-IGZO TFTs.\nFig. 4 shows the transfer characteristics of the a-IGZO TFTs without and with n+-doped a-IGZO source/drain (S/D) regions formed by UV irradiation for 3 h. All the processes were carried out identically for these two samples except for the selective UV\nirradiation of the source/drain areas. Several important parameters of the a-IGZO TFT such as saturation mobility (msat),\nthreshold voltage (Vth), subthreshold swing (SS) and on/off current ratio were compared at room temperature (298 K).\nThe non-UV treated a-IGZO TFT exhibited a msat of 0.6 cm2 V1 s, Vth of 15.0 V, SS value of 0.90 V per decade, and on/off current ratio of 108. These inferior electrical properties were mainly attributed to the high contact resistance between the S/D and the active layer in the a-IGZO TFT.\nOn the other hand, the a-IGZO TFT with an a-IGZO S/D\nregion n+-doped by UV irradiation showed enhanced electrical properties; specically, the msat, Vth, SS, and on/off current ratio were 6.7 cm2 V1 s, 7.3 V, 0.21 V per decade, and 109, respectively. There was a 10 fold increase in the saturation mobility upon UV exposure. These data conrmed that the UV irradiation of the source/drain regions effectively reduced the contact resistance in the a-IGZO TFT. The inset in Fig. 4 provides the output characteristics of the a-IGZO TFT, which shows clear linear regions and no current crowding. The n+-\ndoped a-IGZO TFT also showed a low contact resistance.18 To extract the contact resistance of the a-IGZO TFT, we measured the total resistance (RTOT) variation as a function of channel length in the range from 10 mm to 80 mm at a xed channel width of 160 mm. The applied gate voltage (Vgs) was varied from 15 to 20 V at the drain voltage (Vd) of 0.1 V (Fig. 5). The a-IGZO TFT was operated in enhancement mode (Vth > 0 V),\nand all the channels were turned on for an accurate measurement of the resistance. The contact resistance of the source/\ndrain (Rsd) and the channel length modulation (DL) were extracted by using the transmission line method (TLM). When Vds  Vgs  Vth, the total resistance can be expressed by eqn (1):10,15,19\n$$R_{\\rm TOT}=\\frac{V_{\\rm ds}}{I_{\\rm ds}}=\\frac{L-\\Delta L}{\\mu_{\\rm fe}C_{\\rm ox}\\,W\\big{(}V_{\\rm gs}-V_{\\rm th}\\big{)}}+R_{\\rm sd}\\tag{1}$$\nwhere, RTOT is the total resistance of the TFTs, mfe is the eld effect mobility, Cox is the gate insulator capacitance per unit\narea, W is the channel width, Vth is the threshold voltage, L  DL\nis the effective channel length, and Rsd is the contact resistance of the source/drain. The threshold voltage was obtained from the transfer characteristics. The TLM plot of a-IGZO TFT in Fig. 5 shows the linear dependence of RTOT on the channel length at a Vgs of 15–20 V. Rsd and DL were extracted from the intersection point, and the values of Rsd and DL were 1.7 kU and 0.4 mm, respectively. Multiplication of the channel width\n(160 mm) by Rsd gives the width-normalized Rsd (RsdW), which was 27 U cm in this study.\nRsdW is a suitable way to compare contact resistance with various n+ doping methods because it is independent of the TFT channel width and length. The estimated DL and RsdW\nvalues in our samples and other previously reported results are listed in Table 2 for comparison. In comparison with the plasma treatment methods or the hydrogen diffusion technique, the UV irradiation method shows both a very small DL\nand a low value of RsdW. This comparison demonstrates that the UV irradiation method provides precise doping control in the source/drain regions in coplanar homojunction a-IGZO\nTFTs with n+-doped a-IGZO. Based on these data, we believe that UV irradiation is a very useful and cost-effective way to fabricate a-IGZO TFTs with coplanar homojuction.\nSiNx : H 1.57 33.6 14\nAr plasma treatment - 128 15\nUV irradiation 0.4 27 This work\nDL (mm) RsdW (U cm) Ref.\nIn this research, we investigated the effect of UV irradiation on the resistivity of a-IGZO lms. The resistivity of a-IGZO lms drastically decreased from of 2.71  106 U cm to 105 U cm aer 2 h of UV irradiation and then almost saturated. Such a low resistivity is comparable to ITO transparent electrodes and is about 2 orders of magnitude lower than the resistivities of other reported n+ formation methods such as Ar, H2, and He plasma treatment or the hydrogen diffusion method.\nA suitable masking material for UV shielding must be chosen in order to employ the UV irradiation technique to fabricate coplanar homojunction TFTs. Among a number of shielding materials including AlOx, SiOx, and negative or positive photoresist, the photo-resist layer turned out to be the most effective in masking UV light. Utilizing an optimized UV irradiation time and a patterned PR mask, we successfully fabricated coplanar homojunction a-IGZO TFTs. The a-IGZO TFT exhibited good electrical properties. The saturation mobility (msat),\nthreshold voltage (Vth), subthreshold swing (S/S), and Ion/Ioff ratio were 6.7 cm2 V1 s, 7.3 V, 0.21 V per decade, and 109, respectively. In addition, the channel length modulation, DL,\nwas calculated to be 0.4 mm, which is much smaller than the DL\nvalues obtained using the other doping techniques. The excellent performance of the a-IGZO TFTs was attributed to the nature of UV irradiation, which does not involve signicant lateral diffusion. Consequently, we believe that the application of UV irradiation through a patterned PR mask can be a useful technique to enhance the performance of coplanar a-IGZO TFTs for high-resolution displays.\nThis research was supported by Samsung Display CO., LTD.\nNotes And References\n1 K.

Preface\nThe presence of defects and contaminants in crystalline solids, and in particular crystalline semiconductors, is unavoidable. Defects, if not deliberately introduced, necessarily occur due to a fundamental reason: the lowering of free energy by increasing congurational entropy. Contamination, on the other hand, essentially depends on the contact of the sample with alien species, and therefore on the specicities of growth and processing technologies.\nDefects and impurities in semiconductors can be intentionally introduced in order to confer the material with customised mechanical, electrical, optical or magnetic functionality. However, even when intentionally present, they may also turn 3 **All authors contributed equally to this work.** 4 **The author to whom any correspondence should be addressed.**\nout to be critical as the semiconductor can acquire other prominent, but unwanted properties. For instance, while a certain\namount of dissolved oxygen is highly benecial in terms of the mechanical stability of silicon wafers, under certain conditions the oxygen impurities precipitate and form clusters which act as shallow donors and so increase the availability of electrons for electrical transport at room temperature. This effect alters the electrical specications of the silicon, and in p-type material type-inversion can occur. Another example is the creation of silicon vacancies in silicon carbide which can act as single-photon emitters for quantum communications. However, they are also responsible for the introduction of several deep electron traps which are highly detrimental in terms of compensation effects in n-type material. Clearly, understanding defect properties, and if possible, their quantum mechanics, is paramount for technologies that range from solar power conversion to quantum computing.\nDefects can be classied in many ways, but regarding their\ngeometric properties they are usually distinguished as pointlike and extended. Examples of point defects are vacancies,\ninterstitials, antisites (misplaced atoms in compound crystals)\nand atomic-scale complexes. On the other hand, extended\ndefects include dislocations, surfaces and interfaces. Regardless of their size and shape, they change the potential in the\nHamiltonian of the pristine material. Consequently, that often leads to the appearance of defect states within a spectral range\nwhich would be forbidden to the otherwise perfect crystal.\nUnlike crystalline states, defect states are localised in real\nspace. They may capture charge carriers depending whether\nthe stabilisation energy (for instance due to bond formation or exchange interactions) overcomes the repulsive energy\nbetween the captured charge and other charges already present. In some cases, defects may actually capture more than one\ncarrier of the same type, but now the stabilisation energy has to exceed the repulsion from previously captured charges as well. This extra cost is often referred to as correlation energy\n(U**). We may nd an analogy of this effect in the sequential**\nionisation of an atom, for instance,\n$$\\mathrm{He}^{0}+I_{1}\\to\\mathrm{He}^{+}+\\mathrm{e}^{-};$$  $\\mathrm{He}^{+}+\\mathrm{e}^{-}+I_{2}\\to\\mathrm{He}^{++}+2\\mathrm{e}^{-}$,\n(1)  $\\binom{2}{2}$  . \nwhere In is the n**th ionization energy of the He atom. Here**\nI2 > I1, and the difference U = I2 − I1**, which essentially**\naccounts for the electron–electron repulsion and nuclear screening, is obviously positive. Alternatively, U **may be**\n$$U=E(\\mathrm{He}^{0})+E(\\mathrm{He}^{++})-2E(\\mathrm{He}^{+}),$$\nwhere E(Heq) is the energy of the He atom in the q **charge state.**\nThe fact that U > 0, makes a pair of He+ **ions more stable than**\nHe0 + He++, so that a He+ **gas will not decompose into a mix**\nof He0and He++ **ensembles.**\nAs in the case of isolated atoms, most defects in semiconductors show positive U **values. However, we know today,**\nthat many effectively show a negative-U **correlation between**\nsequential charging events in apparent deance of electrostatics. It is as if they became less 'eager' for electrons (holes)\nimmediately after electron (hole) emission!\nIn the early 1970s, Anderson introduced the idea of negative-U **to explain the absence of paramagnetism in glassysemiconductors doped with n- and p-type impurities . The**\nmaterial was envisaged as a random network of three-state bonds whose potential energy was given by V = 1/2cx2 −\nλep(n↑ + n↓)x + n↑n↓U. Here x **represented a bond coordinate,**\nc its respective harmonic coefcient, and n↑ and n↓ were spinup and spin-down bond occupancies (nσ = {0, 1}**). The last**\nterm accounted for an electronic Hubbard correlation energy , with impact only when both electrons pair to form the bond (n↑ = n↓ = **1). The striking ingredient of the model was**\nthe introduction of an electron–phonon coupling constant λep connecting the bond displacement with its occupancy. Accordingly, considering atomic relaxations and the denition of equation (3), the net effective correlation involving the three states (n↑ + n↓ = {0, 1, 2}) is given by Ueff = U − λ 2 ep/c**. It**\nwas then noted that for sufciently strong coupling, Ueff becomes negative, thus providing an explanation for why in many glasses and polymers, paramagnetic n↑ + n↓ = **1 states** are unstable against diamagnetic n↑ + n↓ = {0, 2} **states.**\nAlthough the original idea of Anderson was to describe the formation of bipolarons (where pairing of two electrons and two holes in a localised region is favoured against single polaron formation), the analogy to the negative-U **effect in**\ndefects is evident. In fact, the concept was extended to defects in semiconducting glasses (like As2Se3**) by Street and Mott**\n. Kastner and co-workers  analysed the applicability of the model to several other compounds, emphasising that the dominant contribution to the negative correlation energy is of chemical origin, or in other words, is driven by rebonding of atoms.\nIn 1979, Baraff, Kane and Schlüter anticipated numerically that neutral, positive and double-positively charged vacancies in crystalline silicon (V\n0 Si, V\nSi **, respectively) formed**\nan 'Anderson negative-U**' system . A Jahn–Teller distortion in the neutral charge state was claimed to be responsible**\nfor the effect, being sufciently stabilising as to render V\nSi unstable against V\n0 Si and V\nSi **, irrespective of the position of**\nthe Fermi energy. A few months later, these predictions were conrmed experimentally by Watkins and Troxell . The following arguments provided the grounds for the claim: (i) the paramagnetic state V\nSi **, as monitored by electron paramagnetic**\nresonance (EPR), was only observed at cryogenic temperatures under photo-excitation. This was an indication that V\nSi is metastable; (ii) upon turning off the light, the intensity of the EPR signal bleached at a rate limited by a barrier of 0.05 eV. This gure was interpreted as the activation barrier for hole emission during V\n0 Si + h\n+**; (iii) from deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS), a peak with an activation barrier**\nfor hole emission of 0.13 eV, with twice the intensity expected for a single hole emission, could be connected to the following two-hole emission sequence,\n$$V_{\\mathrm{Si}}^{++}\\to V_{\\mathrm{Si}}^{+}+\\mathrm{h}^{+}\\to V_{\\mathrm{Si}}^{0}+2\\mathrm{h}^{+}.$$\nIt was then argued that for a negative-U **double donor, the hole**\ninvolved in the rst ionisation was bound more strongly (0.13 eV) than the second one (0.05 eV). Thus, at a temperature where the rst hole is emitted, the second hole should follow immediately, naturally accounting for the double intensity of the peak.\nBaraff, Watkins and others, inspired an entire community towards the characterisation of many other negative-U\ndefects in semiconductors. This account is about their work and the observations and concepts that followed. It aims at reviewing the literature and presenting the most recent results regarding experimental and theoretical methods involved in the characterisation of negative-U **defects in semiconductors.**\nThe main text provides a survey regarding several experimental and theoretical reports on negative-U **defects**\n(section **2), an introduction to the physical concepts involved**\nin the description of negative-U defects (section **3), details**\nregarding experimental and theoretical methods that are used for their characterisation (section 4), a tabular showcase of a selection of negative-U **defects in semiconductors,**\naccompanied by a detailed description of some of the most interesting and technologically relevant ones (section **5), and** nally a revision of the main concepts, results and challenges for the future of the topic (section 6).\n2. Introduction\nMulti-stability is among the most fascinating properties of point defects in semiconductors . In the present context, we refer to a multi-stable defect as one which can be found in several inequivalent atomic congurations for a particular charge state. Along the same lines, a bi-stable defect has two non-degenerate atomic structures in the same charge state. The relative stability as well as formation/annihilation rates of different congurations of multi-stable defects are often sensitive to the application of external stimuli (e.g. temperature, electro-magnetic elds or mechanical stress). Hence, under favourable conditions, their populations can be shifted from those observed under equilibrium.\nUpon changing the atomistic structure of defects, a change of its electronic structure also takes place. It is therefore expected that stimuli-induced defect recongurations may affect signicantly the properties of the host material. Exhibition of persistent photoconductivity, photo-induced capacitance quenching, or temperature-dependent carrier trapping are symptoms that are commonly connected to multi-stability.\nThe magnitude and timescale of these effects depend not only on the properties of the defects themselves, like transformation barriers, cross-sections and transition dipole moments, but also on sample properties like defect concentration and distribution, its thermal history, and of course the measurement conditions.\nNegative-U **defects are intimately tied to multi-stability and**\nmetastability. These defects have at least three charge states, say with electron occupancy |N − 1i, |Ni, and |N + 1i**. Here**\nN is an arbitrary reference and the |N − mi **state also includes**\nm electrons at a reservoir with energy EF **per electron (Fermi**\nlevel). The distinction of negative-U defects is that the intermediate |Ni **state is metastable and not found under equilibrium**\nconditions. Figure 1 **shows a schematic phase diagram of such** a defect, where transition boundaries are drawn as a function of the effective correlation energy (Ueff = I2 − I1) and EF**. Here**\n(N+2−m)is the m**th ionization energy, with**\n(N)standing for the energy of state |Ni. When Ueff > **0, all**\nthree charge states can be populated under equilibrium conditions, depending on the location of the Fermi energy with respect to the transition levels at Ec − I1 and Ec − I2**, where**\nEc is the conduction band bottom. However, for a negative-U defect, only |N − 1i or |N + 1i **states are observed, with**\nequal populations being found when the Fermi level is located at Ec − (I1 + I2)/2.\nNegative-U **defects show strong lattice relaxation effects**\nupon capture and emission of carriers. For that reason, charge state transitions may involve considerable barriers and large Franck–Condon shifts, often making optical absorption and luminescence data hardly comparable to measurements carried out at equilibrium conditions (e.g. Hall effect). The metastable |Ni state of negative-U **defects has a short lifetime,**\nbeing formed only when sample conditions are away from equilibrium. Although reactions like |N − 1**i → |**Ni + h\n+ or |N + 1**i → |**Ni + e\n− **can in principle be stimulated with the**\napplication of external perturbations, e.g. injection of current or light pulsing, the population of |Ni **critically depends on**\na delicate balance between the time of the measurement, the forward and backward reaction (decay) rates, the latter being thermodynamically favoured.\nAnother difculty for detection of negative-U **defects is**\nrelated to the fact that the stability of |N − 1i and |N + 1i states is usually connected to the formation of closed-shell diamagnetic states, and therefore they are undetectable by EPR\n. These are among the many features which make the characterisation of negative-U **defects a challenge, not only in**\nthe laboratory, but also from the perspective of theory and modelling.\nThe decade of the 1980s was particularly prolic regarding the design and conception of experiments capable of probing the properties of negative-U **defects. Watkins and co-workers**\nshowed that in DLTS experiments, after applying lling pulses to Si diodes irradiated with electrons, carriers trapped at **single**\nvacancies (VSi) and boron interstitials (Bi) in Si, were subsequently emitted in pairs under reverse bias [6, **9]. This is a**\nparticular signature of the negative-U **property, which follows**\nfrom the relatively fast rate of the second emission compared to the slow rate of the rst one. To large extent, this is determined by the condition I1 > I2**. Hence, a conventional DLTS**\nexperiment can only measure a single transient, with a decay characteristic of the rst (slower) emission. For the case of Bi, the measured transient correspondedto electron emission from the negatively charged B−\n(the deeper|N + 1i**state) . Direct**\ndetection of the shallower emission B0 i → B\n|Ni **state) was not possible. The series of electrical trap-lling**\npulses required for DLTS measurements, quickly lled all traps into the |N + 1i **state, no matter how short the applied**\npulses were. This was later solved by replacing the biased injection of electrons by optical injection into boron-doped diodes with a mesa structure [10, **11].**\nA prominent example of a multi-stable defect which shows a negative-U **ordering of electronic transitions is the Mcentre in InP. This defect is observed in electron irradiated**\n(1 MeV) undoped, nominally n-type InP, and was found in at least two main forms (A and B), depending on the bias conditions of the sample [12–14]. A clear indication that the A-form shows a negative-U **ordering of transition levels**\nwas found from thermally stimulated capacitance (TSCAP)\nmeasurements. While most transitions indicated an ordinary heating-induced loss of a single charge accumulated in a trap, two of them (labelled A2 and A3), occurred simultaneously, thus pointing to a very specic feature of negative-U\ndefects: a two-electron emission event. Despite the detailed experimental data already reported for the M-centre, the only atomistic model available in the literature is phenomenological. It consists of an indium-vacancy-phosphorous–antisite\n(VInPIn**) and phosphorous-vacancy-phosphorous-antisite-pair** (VP –2PIn**), which were assigned to A and B forms, respectively**\nAnother defect showcasing the negative-U **effect was rstly**\nreported by Henry and Lang in order to explain the observation of persistent photoconductivity in chalcogen-doped AlxGa1−xAs alloys [16, **17]. There was no doubt that the defect**\ninvolved a shallow donor species (D). However, because it also had a deep state at ∼ Ec − 0.**1 eV, postulated at the time**\nas due to complexing with an undetermined constituent (X),\nthe defect was labelled 'DX' centre. Based on rst-principles pseudopotential calculations, Chadi and Chang came up with a model of a deep DX acceptor state localised on a broken SAs**–Ga (or Al) bond . Accordingly, when the Ga (Al)**\natom connected to neutral SAs **(referred to as** d 0**) moves away**\nalong the h111i **crystallographic axis towards the interstitial**\nsite, the total energy increases as expected for a stable structure, but the donor state becomes progressively deeper. When the level has dropped by more than the local repulsive correlation, the total energy is now Ecap ∼ 0.**4 eV above the minimum**\nenergy of d 0**. At this point a free electron (donated by another**\nSAs dopant in the sample) is captured. The subsequent atomistic relaxation stabilises the negative state by Ee = −0.**5 eV,**\nwith DX− landing at Ecap − Ee = 0.**1 eV below the** d 0**state.**\nThe authors underlined that the disproportionation reaction 2d 0 → d\n+ + DX− **was exothermal and therefore indicative of**\na negative-U **defect. This provided a natural explanation for**\nthe lack of EPR involving the DX− **state.**\nA renement of the model was subsequently proposed by Dobaczewski and Kaczor , who carried out a detailed analysis of the photoionisation of DX in Te-doped AlxGa1−xAs.\nIn their work, the intermediate metastable state could better describe the ionisation kinetics if assumed to be a localised DX0 **defect (as opposed to the neutral shallow donor proposed**\nby Chadi and Chang ). It is however consensual that the observed persistent photoconductivity can be accounted for as resulting from the optical ionisation of an equilibrated population of DX− (in the |N + 1i **state) into metastable DX**0 + e\n(|Ni **state), which quickly converts into** d\n+ + 2e− (|N − 1i state). The latter persists due to a large capture barrier hindering the recovery of DX−.\nMany other reports of negative-U **defects followed the**\nabove examples, including defects with huge impact on the electronic properties of semiconductors and devices. Prominent examples are the early members of the thermal double donor family of defects in Si and Ge [20, **21], interstitial hydrogen which can be involved in a multitude of solid-state reactions with defects and dopants in several semiconductors [22,**\n23], the carbon vacancy in 4H- and 6H–SiC which decisively limits the life-time of minority carriers in n-type material , or boron–oxygen complexes involved in the light induced degradation of solar Si .\nThe characterisation of negative-U **defects involves the**\nexperimental monitoring of a two-carrier emission/capture reaction |N + 1i ⇄ |Ni + e\n− ⇄ |N − 1i + 2e−**. This is a**\nmulti-step process involving both electronic transitions and geometric transformations. The kinetics is usually limited by a slow step, effectively 'masking' any subsequent fast steps.\nUnder these circumstances, special tricks have been introduced in order to access the individual steps experimentally.\nExamples are the combination of junction spectroscopy with light excitation, or the judicious control of the amount of free carriers available for capture by using very short and limited injection pulses. From the above, it is also clear that theory, in particular rst-principles modelling of the electronic structure, has played a huge role in unveiling the workings of negative-U **defects and providing guidance for experiments. It is in this**\nspirit of collaboration that we intend to introduce the reader to the topic of negative-U**defects in semiconductors. Besides presenting a survey regarding what has been achieved so far, we**\ndedicated much of the content to the concepts and techniques\n(both experimental and theoretical) involved in the characterisation of this class of defects. We end up with the identication of several problems, from minor loose ends to completely obscure issues, in the hope of stirring up those who may feel challenged by the topic.\n3. Negative-U **Defects In Semiconductors** 3.1. Electronic Correlation\nElectronic correlation can be thought of as a measure of how much entangled two or more electrons are, or alternatively, how hard electron motion is within the eld of other electrons. It is instructive to look at the concept from the perspective of the Hartree–Fock (HF) method . Accordingly, the wave function is represented by a Slater determinant of M spinorbitals φi (x) = ψi (r) σ(si**) with space- and spin-dependence**\nψi (r) and si = {↑, ↓}**, respectively, where** i = 1, . . . , M **is a**\nstate-index. The manifold x **is a composite of space and spin**\ncoordinates. The total energy has contributions from singleelectron and two-electron components ,\n$$E_{\\rm HF}=\\sum_{i}H_{i}+\\sum_{i>j}\\left(J_{ij}-K_{ij}\\right),\\tag{5}$$\n$${\\mathrm{where~}}c o r e\\;i n t e g r a l s,$$\n$$H_{i}=\\int\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{r}^{3}\\,\\psi_{i}^{*}(\\mathbf{r})\\left(-{\\frac{1}{2}}\\nabla_{i}^{2}-\\sum_{\\alpha}{\\frac{Z_{\\alpha}}{|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{R}_{\\alpha}|}}\\right)\\psi_{i}(\\mathbf{r})\\quad\\quad(6)$$\ndescribe a set of independent electrons orbiting in the eld of nuclei located at coordinates Rα**. Here, the** Born–Oppenheimer approximation holds, so that Rα are xed (the nuclear kinetic energy vanishes, whereas the nuclear–nuclear repulsion terms add up to an obvious constant which can be included in the result after computing the electronic energy). Interactions between electrons, namely their mutual repulsion and exchange contributions are given by the *Coulomb* and *exchange* **integrals,**\n$$J_{i j}=\\iint\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{r}^{3}\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime3}\\;{\\frac{|\\psi_{i}(\\mathbf{r})|^{2}|\\psi_{j}(\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime})|^{2}}{|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime}|}}$$\n$$K_{ij}=\\iint\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{r}^{3}\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime3}\\;\\psi_{i}^{*}(\\mathbf{r})\\psi_{j}^{*}(\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime})\\frac{\\langle\\sigma(s_{i})|\\sigma(s_{j})\\rangle}{|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime}|}\\psi_{i}(\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime})\\psi_{j}(\\mathbf{r}),\\tag{8}$$\nrespectively, and they obey to the relation Jij > Kij > 0. Unlike Jij **elements, exchange terms involve the interaction**\nbetween states with parallel spin only. The scalar product hσ(si)|σ(sj)i = 0 when si 6= sj**, i.e. when the interacting**\nspin-orbitals have opposite spin. This follows from the antisymmetry of the wave function with respect to the exchange of any electronic coordinate.\nEquations (7) and (8) translate that each electron effectively interacts with an average charge distribution due to **other**\nelectrons. This mean-eld approximation ignores dynamical correlation, i.e., that electron coordinates are inexorably interdependent, so that they instantaneously avoid one another to reduce their mutual repulsion as much as possible. Nondynamical correlation is also disregarded since the wave function is approximated by a single Slater determinant. Both effects were referred to by Löwdin  as total correlation energy, Ecorr = E − EHF , where E **is the exact non-relativistic**\nenergy of the Schrödinger equation. Ecorr **is a very difcult**\nquantity to obtain—a prohibitively large number (millions) of Slater determinants are needed in order to obtain a wave function approaching the exact solution, thus making the problem intractable, even for today's largest supercomputers .\nIf we are solely interested in the ground state, signicant progress can be made with the use of density functional theory\n(DFT) [31–33], which replaces the HF total energy (a functional of the wave function) by a functional of the electron density ρ **,**\n$$E[\\rho({\\bf r})]=T_{0}[\\rho({\\bf r})]+\\int{\\rm d}{\\bf r}^{3}\\,v_{\\rm ext}({\\bf r})\\rho({\\bf r})+$$  $$+\\frac{1}{2}\\int\\!\\!\\!\\int{\\rm d}{\\bf r}^{3}{\\rm d}{\\bf r}^{\\prime3}\\,\\frac{\\rho({\\bf r})\\rho({\\bf r}^{\\prime})}{|{\\bf r}-{\\bf r}^{\\prime}|}+E_{\\rm xc}[\\rho({\\bf r})].\\tag{9}$$\nAnalogous to the core integrals Hi **of equation (5), the energy**\nfunctional accounts for the kinetic energy of an arbitrary number of non-interacting electrons (T0), subject to an external potential (vext**), due to nuclear and other non-electronic**\nelds. The electron density is obtained from summation over occupied orbitals, ρ(r) =Pi=occ|ψi(r)| 2**, which satisfy a set**\nof partial differential equations analogous to single-particle Schrödinger equations. These are solved self-consistently in order to obtain the ground state density (which depends 32  \nsolely on the external potential) . The electron–electron Coulomb repulsion term in equation (9) is analogous to the contribution of Jij **integrals in HF, although it now includes an**\nunphysical self-interaction energy (electrons are repelled by themselves). In a similar fashion to the exchange integrals Kij, the exchange and correlation functional Exc **describes the electronic exchange interactions, but also incorporates all remaining effects, including correlation (absent in HF) and the neutralisation of the above-mentioned spurious self-interactions.**\nUnfortunately, the mathematical form of Exc **is not known**\n(except for an homogeneous electron gas [32, 35, **36]). However, several approximations have been proposed, varying in**\nphysical detail and accuracy, and of course in computational load (see for instance reference  and references therein).\nA very simple and intuitive method of treating correlation is that proposed by Hubbard for narrow electronic bands . It nicely describes electronic motion within systems whose electrons are strongly localised on atomic orbitals like Mott insulators. Within the second-quantisation formalism, the Hubbard Hamiltonian is given by ,\n$$\\hat{H}_{\\rm Hubb}=t\\sum_{\\langle ij\\rangle,\\sigma}\\hat{c}_{i,\\sigma}^{\\dagger}\\hat{c}_{i,\\sigma}+U\\sum_{i}\\hat{n}_{i,\\uparrow}\\hat{n}_{i,\\downarrow}\\tag{10}$$\nwhere hiji means that the summation runs over nearestneighbour atomic sites i and j**, while** ˆc\n, cˆi,σ and ˆni,σ **stand**\nfor creation, annihilation and number operators for electrons of spin σ on site i**. For strongly localised states, electronic**\nmotion proceeds via hopping at a rate proportional to the jump integral t**, which relates to the band width. This is described**\nby the rst term of equation (10) and involves electron transfer between neighbouring sites hiji**. The second term accounts**\nfor the fact that each site is capable of accommodating up to two electrons of opposite spin. However, when a site is fully occupied (ˆni,↑ = ˆni,↓ = **1), both electrons interact with an**\nenergy U**. Hence, according to the Hubbard model, correlation**\nis the energy raise during an electron transfer event involving two neighbouring sites with identical occupancy (one electron each).\nLet us look at the above concept using a pair of oxygen atoms as an example. We know that the energy of a generic atomic system is a piecewise linear function of the electron occupancy (see for instance reference ). This is illustrated by the Frost diagram of gure 2 **(red line), which shows the** change in the total energy for the sequential reduction of atomic oxygen in contact with an electron reservoir (read the diagram from right to left along the horizontal axis). Oxygen is a highly electronegative species with positive rst electron afnity (A1 = 1.46 eV), and because of that, O− **is more stable**\nthan the neutral atom. However, capture of an additional electron is not favourable due to accumulated Coulomb repulsion.\nThis is exhibited by a negative second afnity, A2 = −7.**71 eV.**\nFrom the diagram, it is also clear that any (even fractional)\ncharge transfer 0 < δ 6 1 between a pair of O− **anions,** 2O− → O\n−1+δ**, raises the total energy by a correlation energy** ∆E\n(N+δ) = (A1 − A2)δ**. For the transfer of a whole**\nelectron (δ = **1), we obtain a general expression for the total**\ncorrelation of a reference state with N **electrons.**\n$$U^{(N)}=\\Delta^{(N+\\delta)}=E^{(N+1)}+E^{(N-1)}-2E^{(N)},\\tag{11}$$\nwhere the energies are indexed to the total number of electrons on each state. For the particular case of the O− **atomic state,**\nthe correlation energy is U = 1.46 + 7.71 = 9.**17 eV.**\nStrictly speaking, correlation is exclusively an electronic property, and that is unambiguously dened for a single atom by equation (11). However, for a more complex moiety (e.g.\na molecule, atom in solution, defect in a solid, etc), the atomistic geometry, vibrational modes and electronic structure of ionised |N + 1i and |N − 1i **states may differ substantially**\nfrom the those of the reference |Ni**-electron state. It is convenient to recall at this point the concept of effective correlation**\nenergy, which besides the electronic contribution, includes a relaxation energy,\n$$U^{(N)}_{\\mathrm{eff}}=U^{(N)}-\\left(\\Delta U^{(N+1)}_{\\mathrm{rel}}+\\Delta U^{(N-1)}_{\\mathrm{rel}}\\right)$$ $$=U^{(N)}-\\Delta U^{(N)}_{\\mathrm{rel}}.$$\n(N)**is the electronic correlation as dened at**\nthe geometry of the N**-electron reference state. On the other**\nrel **are positive relaxation energies,**\nrespectively affecting the |N + 1i and |N − 1i **states just after**\ntransitioning from the N-electron state. These quantitiesreect ionisation-induced atomic recongurations, entropy changes, etc, and they are analogous to the Franck–Condon energy dissipated by a molecule or defect following absorption or luminescent transitions .\n3.2. Disproportionation\nAn electron transfer event involving two identical moieties with N **electrons can be broken into two steps: (i) a sudden electronic excitation where an electron–hole pair is created—this raises the energy by** U\n(N)**, and (ii) a subsequent**\nelectronic/atomistic relaxation that lowers the energy by\nrel **. According to equations (11) and (12), for a relaxation**\nIn that case, a close pair of N**-electron moieties becomes**\nmetastable and disproportionates into N − 1 and N + 1 electron species. Disproportionationis a well-known effect in **electrochemistry, either taking place spontaneously or via thermal**\nactivation, eventually with the help of a catalyst . Although disproportionation necessarily involves electron transfer, it is essentially driven by atomic rearrangement. An eloquent example is given by the reaction\n$$2\\mathrm{Cu}^{+}\\left(\\mathrm{aq}\\right)\\to\\mathrm{Cu}\\left(\\mathrm{s}\\right)+\\mathrm{Cu}^{++}\\left(\\mathrm{aq}\\right)$$\nwhere univalent copper (in solution) precipitates into solid Cu and cupric ions. Being exothermic, reaction 13 gives 2E(Cu+) > E(Cu0) + E(Cu++), with E(Cuq**) being the free**\nenergy per Cu species in the oxidation state q **in its respective**\nphase. In this reaction, the relaxation energy ∆Urel **essentially**\nresults from the formation of Cu bonds in the copper metal.\nAnother textbook example of a disproportionation reaction is the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide accelerated at a metallic surface ,\n$$2\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{2}^{-}\\;(\\mathrm{aq})\\;{\\xrightarrow{\\mathrm{cat}}}\\;2\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O}^{-}\\;(\\mathrm{l})+\\mathrm{O}_{2}\\;(\\mathrm{g}).$$\nThe superscripts in the compounds above stand for the oxidation state of oxygen. According to the reaction, for every O\n−-pair in H2O2**, one oxygen atom is reduced (to form water),**\nwhile another becomes oxidised (leading to formation of molecular oxygen). The Frost diagram for reaction 14 is represented in gure 2 **(blue line). Using equation (11), we nd**\nthat the correlation energy per oxygen atom in H2O2 is\n$U_{\\rm eff}=[E(2{\\rm H}_{2}{\\rm O})+E({\\rm O}_{2})-2E({\\rm H}_{2}{\\rm O}_{2})]/2$  $=-1.06\\,{\\rm eV}$.  \nThe factor of 1/**2 arises due to the fact that each compound has**\ntwo oxygen atoms. The negative effective correlation energy tells us that O− **ions in hydrogen peroxide are metastable**\nagainst disproportionation into O= an O0in water and molecular oxygen, respectively. In gure 2, Ueff **is the free energy**\ndifference per oxygen atom, between the H2O2**(aq) state and a** mix of H2O(l) and O2**(g) represented by the dashed line. Like**\nin the copper ion redox reaction 13, the effective correlation of O− ions in H2O2 **is negative due to atomic reconguration, more specically due to proton transfer and formation**\nof oxygen double bonds after electron transfer.\nMany other examples are found in the literature, including the solid state disproportionation of tin(II) oxide (SnO)\ninto tin(VI) and tin dioxide (SnO2**), again involving dramatic structural transformations , or the loss of bond**\nlength translational order in several perovskites due to random disproportionation of the metallic ions in the lattice .\n3.3. Electronic Transition Levels Of Defects\nThe term *electronic transition level* **of a defect has been**\ngiven different meanings depending on the context. It has been interpreted differently, depending whether one refers to single-particle or many-body calculations, if it embodies **electron–phonon coupling or not, or perhaps if it relates to measurements based on thermodynamic or kinetic quantities. In**\nthe present case, an electronic transition level of a defect (or simply *defect level***), is denoted as ,**\n$$E(N{+}1\\,/\\,N)=E^{(N+1)}-E^{(N)},$$\nand corresponds to the Fermi energy of a material, EF**, above**\nwhich the ground state of N + **1 electrons bound to a defect**\nis more stable than any N**-electron state (plus one electron at**\nthe Fermi reservoir). Analogously, one could say that when EF drops below an E(N+1/N) level, the (N + **1)-electron state**\nbecomes unstable against the N**-electron state (plus one electron at the Fermi reservoir). When the Fermi level coincides**\nwith the defect level, N- and (N + **1)-state populations are**\nidentical. Under such conditions, the following isothermic conversion between D(N)**and D**(N+1),\n$$D^{(N)}+{\\mathrm e}^{-}\\rightleftarrows D^{(N+1)},$$\nshows identical forward and backward rates and occurs via exchange of electrons (e−**) with a reservoir with Fermi energy**\nLet us assume that we have a concentration [D] of noninteracting and identical defects in a sample at temperature T.\nWe also postulate that for the allowed range of EF **values, the**\ndefects may occur in up to two charge states, with respective concentrations [D(N)] and [D(N+1)**], thus possessing a single** electronic transition level E(N+1/N**). Under equilibrium, the**\nfraction of defects with N **bound electrons is given by [46–48],**\n$$f^{(N)}=Z^{-1}g^{(N)}\\,\\exp{\\Big(}-E_{\\mathrm{f}}^{(N)}/k_{\\mathrm{B}}T{\\Big)},$$\nwhere kB is the Boltzmann constant, Z **the partition function,**\n$$Z=\\sum_{m}g^{(m)}\\,\\exp\\left(-E_{\\mathrm{f}}^{(m)}/k_{\\mathrm{B}}T\\right),$$\n(m)**is a degeneracy factor . In equations (19) and (20),**\nfis the formation energy of a stable m**-electron state,**\n$$E_{\\mathrm{f}}^{(m)}=E^{(m)}-m E_{\\mathrm{F}}$$\nwith the second term on the right of equation (21) representing the chemical potential of electrons in a reservoir with Fermi energy EF**. For our two-state defect this results in the wellknown distribution function,**\n$$f^{(N+1)}=\\left[1+\\left(\\frac{g^{(N)}}{g^{(N+1)}}\\right)\\exp\\left(\\frac{E(N{+}1\\,/\\,N)-E_{\\rm F}}{k_{\\rm B}T}\\right)\\right]^{-1}.\\tag{22}$$  **one**: if $E_{\\rm F}$ is lowered below $E(N{+}1\\,/\\,N)$ the backward rate of \nHence, if EF is lowered below E(N+1/N**), the backward rate of**\nreaction 18 exceeds the forward rate, and most defects bind N\nelectrons. Conversely, if EF is raised above E(N+1/N**), occupation of the next available bound state becomes energetically**\nfavourable and the reaction proceeds to the right. Dened in this way, an electronic level depends on ground state energies E\n(N+1) **only. It is a thermodynamic quantity, analogous**\n$$(17)^{\\frac{1}{2}}$$\n$$(18)^{\\frac{1}{2}}$$\nto a critical chemical potential for which a phase transition takes place.\nNext we consider the case of a defect with two transition levels in the band gap. These dene the borders between three charge states, say D(N−1), D(N)and D(N+1)**, in phase space. Let**\nus inspect the populations of the three charge states by varying the level positions, but keeping the Fermi level locked at midway between E(N/N−1) and E(N+1/N**), i.e.,** EF = [E\n(N−1)]/**2. Using equation (19), we readily arrive at,**\n$$(19)^{\\frac{1}{2}}$$\n$$f^{(N)}=\\left[1+\\frac{g^{(N+1)}+g^{(N-1)}}{g^{(N)}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{U_{\\rm eff}^{(N)}}{k_{\\rm B}T}\\right)\\right]^{-1}$$  $$f^{(N\\pm1)}=\\left[1+\\frac{g^{(N\\mp1)}}{g^{(N\\pm1)}}+\\frac{g^{(N)}}{g^{(N\\pm1)}}\\exp\\left(\\frac{U_{\\rm eff}^{(N)}}{2k_{\\rm B}T}\\right)\\right]^{-1}$$  with  $$U_{\\rm eff}^{(N)}=E(N+1\\,/\\,N)-E(N\\,/\\,N-1).$$\n(23)  $$\\begin{array}{l}\\small\\mathbf{(24)^{}}\\end{array}$$ . \nThe above fractions are plotted in gure **3(a), where we**\n(N+1) = **1. Under these conditions** f\n(N−1)**, thus being represented by a common**\n(N±1)**. The above degeneracy factors do not inuence the location of the transition levels when extrapolated to**\nT → 0. In the graph of gure **3(a) we also assume that the band**\ngap width is Eg = 1 eV and T = **300 K.**\nFor a positive-U **defect (**U\neff > **0), we have** f\nright-hand side of gure **3(a)) and the population of the other**\ntwo states is negligible. On the other hand, for a negative-U defect (U\neff < 0), D(N)**is metastable as seen by the negligible**\nprobability of nding this state (left-hand side of gure **3(a)).**\nUnder these conditions, the reaction\n2D(N) ⇄ D\nbecomes an exothermic disproportionation process with an energy balance,\n$$\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{r}}=E(N{+}1\\,/\\,N)-E(N\\,/\\,N{-}1)=U_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{(N)}.$$\nWhen the Fermi level is in the middle of the two levels with negative-U ordering, D(N−1) and D(N+1) **show identical populations**f\n(N±1) = 1/**2, implying the existence of an** E(N+1/N−1)\n$$E(N+1\\,/\\,N-1)=[E(N+1\\,/\\,N)+E(N\\,/\\,N-1)]/2,$$\nwhich is represented by the thick blue line in the right-hand side of gure 3(b). The E(N/N−1) and E(N+1/N**) levels**\ninvolve the metastable D(N)**state, so that they cannot correspond to thermodynamic transition levels. Their location is**\nindicated by the arrows in gure **3(b). Instead, they determine**\nthe position of the thermodynamic E(N+1/N−**1) transition,**\nwhich involves the exchange of two electrons with the Fermi reservoir. Finally, for the peculiar case of U\neff = 0, gure **3(a)**\n(N±1) = 1/**3 so that a triple-point with**\nall states equally populated is attained. Under these conditions, all states in reaction 26 are equilibrated under isothermic conditions (∆Er = 0).\n3.4. Formation Energy Diagrams\nIn the dilute limit, where defect–defect interactions are negligible, the equilibrium concentration of a defect on a charge state q **depends on its formation energy** E\n$$(-E_{\\mathrm{f}}^{(q)}/k_{\\mathrm{B}}T),$$\n] being the density of degenerate congurations (lattice sites and orientations per unit volume) that the defect has in the sample. In the above, we now use the charge state q to label the electronic state of the defect (instead of the number of electrons or holes). The formation energy in equation (29)\n$$(26)^{\\frac{1}{2}}$$\nexpresses the cost to create an isolated defect by trading electrons and atomic species with electronic and atomic reservoirs with chemical potentials EF and µi**, respectively (see reference**\n and references therein),\n$$E_{\\rm f}^{(q)}(\\mu_{i},E_{\\rm F})=E^{(q)}-\\sum_{i}n_{i}\\mu_{i}+qE_{\\rm F},\\tag{30}$$\n$$(27)^{\\frac{1}{2}}$$\n(q)is the energy per defect in charge state q**, surrounded**\nby a sufciently large volume of host material, enclosing ni atoms of species i **(dilute limit). We note that in equation (29)**\nwe did not consider the contribution of entropy to the formation energy. To do so, E\nf **would have to be replaced by**\na free energy of formation, and E\n(q)**in equation (30) would**\n(q) − TS(q)**, with** H\n(q)**being the enthalpy and**\nentropy per defect in charge state q**, the later accounting for**\nvibrational, electronic and magnetic entropy terms. While the formation entropy can be of signicant importance, in particular at high temperatures , for defects with deep states in the gap, electronic excitations depend exponentially on large activation energies, so that electronic and magnetic entropy can often be neglected. More care has to be taken regarding the vibrational entropy, particularly for negative-U **defects**\nwhere distinct structures with rather different vibrational spectra can occur. Although being usually small when compared to the electronic transitions of deep defects, vibrational entropy can be easily incorporated in equation (30) (see for instance Estreicher *et al* **).**\nDefect formation energies are in principle positive quantities, otherwise the host material would become unstable against spontaneous defect creation. The graphical representation of the formation energy of a defect as a function of the Fermi level (for a xed set of atomic chemical potentials) is a common procedure in defect physics and chemistry. It allows us to compare the relative binding energy of electrons to different defects (with variable charge and stoichiometry) with respect to a common reference—the Fermi level.\nOn the left-hand side of gure 4 **we depict a formation**\nenergy diagram of the carbon vacancy (VC**) located on the**\npseudo-cubic site of 4H–SiC, for EF **values in the upper part of**\nthe band gap (n-type material). The diagram was constructed solely based on experimental observations. The origin of the horizontal axis (right limit of the axis) corresponds to the conduction band bottom. As we move to the left, EF **lowers within**\nThe VC **defect at the pseudo-cubic site is a double acceptor**\nthat shows negative-U**ordering of levels. These were measured**\nby conventional DLTS and Laplace-DLTS at Ec − E(= /−) = 0.64 eV and Ec − E(−/0) = 0.41 eV [24, **53]. From**\nequation (28) and taking the singly negative state as reference, the acceptor states show an effective negative correlation energy of Ueff = −0.**23 eV, and that implies the existence of a**\nthermodynamic transition level at,\n$$1/2=E_{\\mathrm{c}}-0.53\\,{\\mathrm{e}}$$\nE(= /0) = [E(= /−) + E(−/0)]/2 = Ec − 0.**53 Ev, (31)**\nwhile E(= /−) and E(−/0) are metastable. The E(= /**0) level**\nestablishes that under equilibrium conditions, only V\n0 C\nstates can be found in n-type 4H–SiC. This is highlighted in gure 4 **as solid and dashed lines for the representation of**\nthe formation energy of stable and metastable states, respectively. That explains why observation of the V\nparamagnetic state requires optical excitation . All three relevant transitions are indicated in the horizontal axis of gure 4 **by vertical**\nlines at the crossing points of the formation energy segments.\nThe slope of each segment is qEF**, clearly distinguishing the**\ncharge state of the respective V\ndefect. The charge neutralisation condition holds via trading of (2 − q)e− **electrons with the**\nFermi reservoir. The last piece of information needed to construct the formation energy diagram of gure 4 **is the formation energy of the neutral species (**V\n0 C\n). This was measured by means of high temperature annealing/quenching experiments as E\nf = 4.**8 eV .**\n3.5. Configuration Coordinate Diagrams\nWhile formation energy diagrams capture defect thermodynamics, they are not so useful when it comes to representing the kinetics of transitions which are actually measured by many techniques, including optical spectroscopy and DLTS. In essence, a typical experiment involves monitoring the response of a sample subjected to the application/removal of an external perturbation (e.g. applied eld or temperature), leading to a displacement/recovery of the equilibrium conditions. The measured excitation/relaxation rates of defects in semiconductors may involve absorption/emission of light, the exchange of energy and momentum with phonons and electrons within the sample, or a combination of all these processes. Although being applicable to any type of electronic transitions, we introduce the concept of a conguration coordinate (CC) diagram to illustrate the vibronic nature of non-radiative capture and thermal emission of carriers, which due to the conservation of energy, involve a trade of phonons with the host lattice . This is the most common type of transitions for negative-U **defects, where strong electron–phonon coupling effects are**\nThe process of non-radiative phonon assisted transitions is depicted in the CC diagram of gure **5, where we assume**\nthat the whole system has a single effective vibrational degree\nof freedom. The |Ni **ground state nds its minimum at**\nthe generalised atomic coordinate Q\n(N)**. The upper parabola,**\nwhich is displaced up in energy by the band gap width\n(Eg), represents an excited state comprising a |Ni **defect plus**\nan uncorrelated electron–hole pair (eventually created after illumination of the sample with above-bandgap light). In the middle of the CC diagram we represent a |N − 1i **state, which**\ndue to electron–phonon coupling, has a minimum-energy coordinate shifted to Q\n(N−1). To avoid unnecessary complications, we assume that the curvature of both |Ni and |N − 1i parabola corresponds to the same vibrational frequency with quanta ~ω.\nThermal activated conversion of |Ni into |N − 1i **can be**\nachieved in two ways: either (i) upon capture of a free-hole followed by multi-phonon emission, or (ii) via emission of a bound electron into the conduction band assisted by multiphonon capture . In the rst case the hole capture coefcient is given by Cp = σphvvith p**, (32)**\nwhere σp **is the apparent capture cross-section for holes travelling in the valence band top with thermal-average velocity**\nhvvith and density p**. In the second case, the emission rate is**\n$$e_{n}=\\sigma_{n}\\langle v_{\\rm c}\\rangle_{\\rm th}N_{\\rm c}\\,\\frac{g^{(N-1)}}{g^{(N)}}\\exp\\left(\\frac{E_{\\rm c}-E(N\\,/\\,N-1)}{k_{\\rm B}T}\\right),\\tag{33}$$\nwith Nc **being the density of available states in the conduction**\n(N)**the degeneracy ratio of the nal**\nto the initial state. The quantities σn and hvcith are electronanalogues of σp and hvvith.\nIt is important to note that the above transitions occur close to the crossing points of the energy curves. Henry and Lang  have shown that the uncertainty principle implies that the adiabatic approximation (upon which the wave function is instantly consistent with the potential of the oscillating **nuclei),**\nbreaks down close to these points, so that transitions may in fact occur for Q **values in a range where** |E\n60 meV. This feature is incorporated in the temperature dependence of the effective capture cross-section,\n$$\\sigma=\\sigma_{\\infty}\\,\\exp(-E_{\\sigma}/k_{\\mathrm{B}}T),$$\nσ = σ∞ exp(−Eσ/kBT**), (34)**\nwith σ∞ being the geometrical (T**-independent) capture cross**\nsection. Capture rates are therefore thermally activated (see section 4.2.2 for further details), and according to gure **5, the** capture barrier for electrons or holes is\n$$E_{\\sigma n/p}={\\frac{(E_{\\mathrm{{un}}/p}-E_{\\mathrm{{FC}}})^{2}}{E_{\\mathrm{{FC}}}}},$$\n$$(36)^{\\frac{1}{2}}$$\nwhere the depth of the trap for electrons is \n$$E_{\\mathrm{in}}=E_{\\mathrm{c}}-E(N\\,/\\,N{-}1)=E_{\\mathrm{em,n}}+E_{\\mathrm{FC}},$$\n$$E_{\\mathrm{tp}}=E(N\\,/\\,N\\!-\\!1)-E_{\\mathrm{v}}=E_{\\mathrm{em,}p}+E_{\\mathrm{FC}}.$$\nIn the above, trap energies are divided into two components:\na *vertical emission* **and a** *Franck–Condon relaxation*, Eem,n/p and EFC, respectively (see gure **5). Within a single-mode**\napproximation,the latter relates to the vibrational frequency by the Huang–Rhys factor as EFC = SHR~ω**, which for strongly**\ncoupled transitions discloses the dissipation of many phonons\nWe can now use our example of the carbon vacancy (double acceptor) in 4H–SiC, and combine its CC and formation energy diagrams to obtain a consistent and insightful picture of the measurements. The early DLTS experiments by Hemmingsson *et al*  have found that the conspicuous Z1/2 **peak**\ncorresponds to the superposition of two nearly identical Z1 and Z2 negative-U **defects, differing only on the sub-lattice location. These measurements were recently rened by Koizumi**\net al ** in 6H–SiC and by Capan** *et al* ** in 4H–SiC, using** Laplace-DLTS. The negative-U **ordering of levels implies that**\nduring lling of the defect, the binding energy of the second electron is higher than that of the rst one. On the other hand, for the reverse process, the thermal emission of the rst electron immediately induces a second emission.\nThe above is better perceived with help of gure **4. Accordingly, before pulsing in the majority carriers (n-type material),**\nthe diode is under reverse bias and the Fermi level is lower than the acceptor levels. The formation energy diagram of gure 4 indicates that the stable state is the neutral one (V\n0 C\n). After applying a lling pulse (zero or forward bias), the Fermi level edges the conduction band minimum and the CC diagram on the right-hand side of gure 4 **applies. In these conditions the**\ndouble negative state (V\n) is more stable and the kinetics of 10 32  \n0 C + 2e− → V\nis essentially limited by the second capture event [24, **53]—the negative charge accumulated**\non the defect after the rst capture makes it less effective for a second capture. Interestingly, what makes VC **a negative-**U\ndefect are strong pseudo-Jahn–Teller relaxations that mainly affect the close shell states (neutral and double negative) **,**\nto become metastable (see dashed black lines in gure **4). The relevant structures (labelled B and D), which**\nwere found by rst-principles calculations , are indicated in the CC diagram, where atoms connected by segments show considerably shorter distances than those in bulk SiC.\nWhen reverse bias is restored, V\nbecomes unstable, and if the temperature is high enough, two electrons are emitted into the conduction band and swept away from the depletion region. We note that the electron capture barriers for V\n0 C\n(at the pseudo-cubic site) were found to be as low as E\nσn ∼ 0.**03 eV, respectively . Considering the relative depth of both acceptor levels with respect to**\nEc**, electron emission from** V\nhas a higher barrier than that from V\nn**is the electron emission rate from** V\n). Hence, conventional DLTS is only able to monitor a transient whose decay reects the rst (slower) emission only. This feature is clearly shown in gure **4, illustrating**\na major difculty regarding the characterisation of negative-U\ndefects—probing the intermediate metastable state.\nIn the particular case of VC **the metastable state is the singly**\nnegative defect. Access to this state was achieved by optical excitation  and keeping the sample at low temperatures to avoid carrier re-emission, or providing a small amount of electrons to a reverse-biased n-type diode, via short injection [53, **59] or optical pulses . The injection level must be well**\nbelow saturation limit so that the fraction of defects in the V\nstate is much smaller than that in the V\nAlthough we can only observe a single emission peak by means of junction spectroscopy, the underlying double emission sequence leads to a variation of the capacitance twice as large to that observed for a transition involving a single emission. As we will see in the next Section, this stands as a rather characteristic feature which is often helpful in the identication of negative-U **defects.**\n4. Methods Of Characterisation 4.1. Probing Negative-U Defects\nFor the sake of convenience, below we refer to the effective correlation energy simply as U ≡ Ueff**. It has already been**\nmentioned above that under equilibrium conditions, defects with negative-U **properties emit or capture charge carriers by** pairs. So, a conrmation of the negative-U **property of a defect**\nrequires evidence of such paired emission or capture of charge carriers.\nThe rst denitive experimental evidence of negative-U\nproperties of a defect in a crystalline semiconductor, the lattice vacancy in silicon (VSi**), was obtained from DLTS measurements . This technique is frequently used for the determination of the concentration of defects with deep levels.**\nAccordingly, the magnitude of a measured signal (change in 32  \nsample capacitance due to carrier emission from a defect), is usually directly proportional to the concentration the defect trap it refers to, ∆C ∼ **[D] . However, it was found in reference  that the magnitude of the DLTS signal due to hole**\nSi was proportional to 2[VSi**], so conrming that each emission event was in fact a two-hole emission**\nsequence, so the vacancy in Si is a defect with U < 0.\nIt should be mentioned that for the conclusion about ∆C ∼\n2[D] in the recorded DLTS spectra, an independent method of determination of the vacancy concentration was used. Reliable independent methods for the determination of the concentration of a defect in semiconductor samples for DLTS measurements are rarely possible, so from a conventional analysis of emission signals in the DLTS spectra, it is usually not possible to judge if a carrier emission signal is related to a defect with positive or negative effective correlation energy. Simple analysis of temperature dependencies of carrier emission rates measured with DLTS for a negative-U **defect gives only information about parameters for the emission (activation energy**\nfor emission and apparent capture cross section) of the rst, more strongly bound, charge carrier.\n4.1.1. Elucidation of the nature of a defect by means of analysis of its occupancy with charge carriers at equilibrium conditions. Solid evidence of negative-U **properties for a number**\nof defects in semiconductors has been obtained from studies of their occupancy with charge carriers at equilibrium conditions.\nThe general statistics of charge distribution at equilibrium conditions for defects with several trapping levels in semiconductors has been presented in 1957 by Shockley and Last . It has been shown that the concentration ratio of defects in two charge states differing by one electron is\n$$\\frac{[{\\rm D}^{(N)}]}{[{\\rm D}^{(N-1)}]}=\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E(N/N-1)-E_{\\rm F}}{k_{\\rm B}T}\\right),\\tag{38}$$\nwhere N **is the number of electrons in the most negative state**\nand E(N/N−1) is the energy level of the defect (cf section **3.3).**\nFor a defect with two energy levels, the relationship between them can by represented by\n$$E(N{+}1\\,/\\,N)=E(N\\,/\\,N{-}1)+U.$$\nIf U < 0 and |U| ≫ kBT**, it follows from equation (38) that** for any position of EF, [D\n(N−1)] ∼= [D], where [D] is the total concentration of the defect. Furthermore, the electron occupancy function of the |N + 1i **state is**\n$$f_{U<0}^{(N+1)}=\\frac{[\\text{D}^{(N+1)}]}{[\\text{D}]}$$ $$=\\left\\{1+\\exp\\left[2\\frac{E(N+1\\,/\\,N-1)-E_{\\text{F}}}{k_{\\text{B}}T}\\right]\\right\\}^{-1},\\tag{40}$$  re the quantity $E(N+1/N-1)=[E(N+1/N)+1/N-1]$.  \nE(N/N−1)]/**2 represents the occupancy level of the defect**\nwith U < 0. When EF > E(N+1/N−**1), the defect has** N+1 electrons, when EF < E(N+1/N−**1), the defect has** N − 1 electrons. It is the difference between equation (40) and\n![11_image_0.png](11_image_0.png)\nthe Fermi function, the later describing the occupancy of single-electron defect levels, that allows us to determine the nature of a defect (the sign of the effective electron correlation energy) from a study of its occupancy with charge carriers.\nThe free energy of ionisation with respect to a reference level (for instance the conduction band bottom), can be presented as\n$$\\Delta E(N+1\\,/\\,N-1)=E_{\\rm c}-E(N+1\\,/\\,N-1)\\tag{41}$$ $$=\\Delta H-T\\Delta S,\\tag{42}$$\n$$(39)^{\\frac{1}{2}}$$\nwhere ∆H and ∆S **are the changes in enthalpy and entropy**\ndue to the (N+1/N−1) ionisation event, and it is temperature dependent if ∆S(N+1/N−1) 6= **0. As an illustration,**\ngure 6 **compares dependencies of charge occupancy versus**\nFermi level position in the gap (i) for a defect with U < 0 and Ec − E(N+1/N−1) = 0.**3 eV and (ii) for a defect**\nwith U > 0 and Ec − E(N+1/N) = 0.**3 eV in n-type silicon, with fully ionised shallow donors providing a density**\nn = 1 × 1015cm−3 **of free electrons. The dependencies have**\nbeen calculated assuming that n ≫ **[D], and changes in the**\nFermi level position have been induced by temperature variations.\nThe simplest way to probe the occupancy of a defect with charge carriers is to change the temperature of a semiconductor sample in a certain range and monitor associated changes either in free carrier concentration measured by means of Hall effect, or in magnitude of a signal related to emission or capture of charge carriers measured by means of DLTS. Negative-U **properties for a number of defects in semiconductors have**\nbeen elucidated from analyses of temperature dependencies of free carrier concentrations, n(p) ∼ f(T). Particularly, evidence of negative-U properties of the Si vacancy [61, **62],**\n![12_image_0.png](12_image_0.png)\noxygen-related thermal double donors (TDDs) in silicon and germanium [20, 21, **63], and complexes consisting of a Si**\ninterstitial atom with oxygen dimer (IO2**)  and interstitial** carbon, oxygen and hydrogen atoms (CiOi**H)  in Si has**\nbeen obtained from analyses of temperature dependencies of electron (hole) concentrations.\nThe experimental n(p) vs T **dependencies can be analysed**\neither by methods based on solving charge carrier neutrality equations  or by the differential method proposed by Hoffmann . According to the differential method, the concentration of a defect and position of its energy level in the gap can be determined from a dependency of X = kBT(dn/dEF) versus EF in semiconductors of n-type [X = kBT(dp/dEF**) in**\nsemiconductors of p-type]. The X(EF**) dependencies look like**\nspectra with peaks induced by ionisation of defects. The magnitude of a peak (Xm**) is proportional to the concentration of a**\ndefect, while the peak position (Em) corresponds to the position of an energy level in the gap. It has been shown in references  that for defects with U > 0, Xm = 0.**25[D]**\nand the half-width of a band, δEF, is about 3.5kBTm**, where** Tm is the temperature which corresponds to Em**. For defects with**\nU < 0 on the other hand, Xm = [D] and δEF ≈ 1.8 kBTm**. So,**\nan analysis of the half-width of bands in the X(EF**) dependencies can be considered as a quick test on the sign of effective**\nAs an example, gure 7 shows n(103/T) and X(F) dependences with F = Ec − EF**, for an oxygen-rich Ge crystal,**\nwhich was subjected to heat-treatments of different durations at 623 K . Such heat-treatments are known to result in the introduction of oxygen-relatedthermal double donors (TDDs), which consist of a family of subsequently formed (at least nine) defect species in Ge:O crystals . An analysis of the X(F) spectra in gure 7 **showed that the half-width of the three**\nappearing bands is about 1.8 kBTm**, so giving solid evidence**\nthat the rst three species of the TDD family of defects in Ge are centres with negative-U **.**\nFrom investigations of the occupancy of negative-U **defects**\nwith charge carriers at equilibrium conditions, only a value of free energy for the two-electron charge state change, ∆E(N+\n1/N−**1), can be determined. Further information about the**\nE(N+1/N) and E(N/N−**1) values, charges states, structural**\ncongurations and energy barriers between them can be obtained from investigations of non-equilibrium processes of carrier emission and capture.\n4.1.2. Observations of negative-U defects in metastable configurations. For the majority of defects with U < **0, rather**\nlarge energy barriers exist between their atomic congurations.\nBecause of these barriers, under certain conditions, it is possible to 'freeze' a negative-U **defect in a metastable atomic**\nconguration with a shallower level, and to obtain information about the electronic properties of the defect in this conguration. Such 'freezing' or, in other words, deep-shallow excitation can be induced by different methods, e.g., by (i) injection of minority carriers in certain temperature ranges either by above-bandgap-energy light pulses or forward bias pulses in n–p diodes, (ii) a quick change in temperature\n(quenching), usually from higher to lower T**, (iii) cooling down**\nof a semiconductor sample under external illumination with photons having above-bandgap energies, (iv) cooling down an n-p diode with an applied reverse bias voltage. The signicant changes in n(p) vs T **dependencies, in DLTS, EPR**\nand various optical (infrared absorption, photoluminescence, etc) spectra induced by the 'freezing'/excitation methodslisted above, usually indicate the presence of metastable (negative-U**) defect states in a semiconductor material. From analysis**\nof the appearing signals in the excited spectra, electronic and structural characteristics of a negative-U **defect in the shallow**\nlevel conguration can be determined.\nIn EPR studies, a number of defects, e.g., positively charged vacancy and interstitial boron in silicon [6, 9, **10], Se-related**\nDX centre in AlSb  or carbon vacancy in 4H–SiC ,\ncould only be observed in the spectra after external illumination with above-band-gap light. It has even been argued in reference  that the absence of an EPR signal in the samples cooled in the dark and its appearance after illumination can be considered as a direct evidence of the negative-U **properties.**\nIt should be noted, however, that such effects can be related to a defect with a single deep level in the gap and large energy barrier for capture of a charge carrier.\nIn Si and Ge crystals containing oxygen-related thermal double donors, signicant changes in n(T**) dependencies and**\nIR absorption spectra have been observed after cooling the investigated samples down under external illumination with energy hν > Eg [20, 21, 63, 69, **71–73]. In the 'illuminated'**\n![13_image_0.png](13_image_0.png)\nIR absorption spectra of Si crystals, three sets of absorption bands, which have not been seen in the spectra recorded after cooling down in the dark, were detected [20, **71–73]. From** the analysis of positions of the electronic-transition related absorption lines in the 'illuminated' spectra, the exact locations of energy levels of three bistable TDD species (negative-U defects) in the shallow donor conguration could be determined in both Si and Ge [20, 69, **71–73].**\nChanges in DLTS spectra that resulted from different cooling down conditions of investigated diodes have been reported for semiconductor samples containing both defects with negative-U **properties and metastable defects with** U > 0\n[64, **73–76]. The spectra are usually recorded upon heating**\nthe diodes up after their cooling down either with or without a reverse bias applied. Cooling down with the applied reverse bias, when there are no free electrons/holes in the probed 'depletion' region, results in 'freezing' of a negative-U **defect in a conguration with a shallower level, which is**\nthe minimum energy conguration at high temperatures. So, typically, in the DLTS spectra recorded after cooling down the diodes with the applied reverse bias, a signal due to charge emission from the shallower level appears, and a signal due to emission from the deeper level either disappears or decreases. As an example, gure 8 **compares the DLTS spectra for a**\nCzochralski silicon (Cz-Si) sample containing the IO2 complex (with I**standing for a Si self-interstitial). This complex is a**\nnegative-U **defect with its rst and second donor levels being at**\nE(0/+) = Ev + 0.**12 eV and** E(+/ + +) = Ev + 0.**36 eV [64,**\n77]. The spectra were recorded after cooling down with either bias-on or bias-off. Cooling down with the applied reverse bias resulted in the disappearance of the DLTS signal due to hole emission from the double positively charged state (the minimum energy conguration at low temperatures) of the IO2 defect and appearance of the signal due to hole emission from the metastable single positively charged state.\nFurther, back transformations from a metastable to stable conguration can be induced by e.g. an increase in temperature if majority charge carriers are available. From studies of kinetics of these backward processes at different temperatures in semiconductor crystals with different free carrier concentrations, a comprehensive set of information about the electronic structure and concentration of defects with negative-U **can be**\n4.1.3. Non-equilibrium occupancy statistics for defects with U < 0. **The non-equilibrium occupancy statistics for defects**\nwith U < **0 have been developed in references [78–80]. For**\nan elucidation of the details of these statistics let us consider a total concentration Nd of an amphoteric defect (having acceptor and donor levels) with negative-U **level ordering, which**\nexchange charge carriers (electrons) with the conduction band. Figure 9 **shows a general conguration-coordinate diagram**\nfor such a defect. In the absence of minority carriers, transitions between the stable acceptor (A−) and donor (D+**) states**\noccur through the metastable X0and D0**states according to the**\nfollowing sequence of reactions:\n$$\\mathrm{A}^{-}\\rightleftarrows\\mathrm{A}^{0}+\\mathrm{e}^{-}\\rightleftarrows\\mathrm{X}^{0}+\\mathrm{e}^{-}\\rightleftarrows\\mathrm{D}^{+}+2\\mathrm{e}^{-}$$\nThe changes in the density of defect states and in the free electron concentration can be described by the following set of differential equations,\nd[A−] dt= +cX0 [X0] − eA− [A−], d[X0] dt= −cX0 [X0] + eA− [A−] − ωXD[X0] + ωDX[D0], d[D0] dt= +cD+ [D+] + eD0 [D0] + ωXD[X0] − ωDX[D0], d[D+] dt= −cD+ [D+] + eD0 [D0], dn dt = −cX0 [X0] + eA − [A−] − cD+ [D+] + eD0 [D0], where emission and capture rates, eQ and cQ, are dened as\neQ = cQ′(Nc/n**) exp[**−∆E(Q/Q\n$$c_{Q}=\\sigma_{\\infty Q}n\\langle v_{\\mathrm{c}}\\rangle_{\\mathrm{th}}\\,\\exp(-E_{\\sigma Q}/k_{\\mathrm{B}}T),$$\nrespectively, with Q and Q\n′**referring to neighbouring con-**\ngurations with different charge.

For the transformation process, ω∞,QQ′ and EQQ′ **are the high-temperature**\nattempt frequency and transformation barrier, respectively.\nThe full solution of the above set of the differential\nequations is not an easy task. It should be noted, however, that some of the reaction rates are usually much faster than others, so some of the states are in quasi-equilibrium. Furthermore, upon the assumption that Nd ≪ n ≈ **'const', the above set of**\nequations can be transformed to a set of rst order differential equations, which can be solved analytically. Below we will consider in more detail the changes in the density of the A−\nstate, which is usually monitored in DLTS measurements. The changes in the density of the A− state at a constant temperature after an initial deviation from equilibrium, ∆[A−]0**, can**\nbe expressed by the following equation,\n$$\\Delta[\\mathrm{A}^{-}](t)=\\Delta[\\mathrm{A}^{-}]_{0}\\,\\exp(-t/\\tau),$$\nwhere τ **is the characteristic time of the decay process.

Particularly inuential factors are the Fermi level position with**\nrespect to E(−/0), E(0/+) and E(−/+**), and the** cX0 /ωXD\nratio. The effective emission rate, eeff**, is the dominant**\nterm in equation (50) when the Fermi level is below the E(−/+) = Ec − [E(−/0) + E(0/+)]/**2 occupancy level of a**\nnegative-U **defect. At these conditions,** τ\n− **, so the temperature dependence of**\n−1**can be described by a commonly used equation for**\nsingle electron emission. For the cases of cX0 ≫ ωXD,\n− /cX0 , so the transformation rate (actually the rate of occupancy of the A− **state) is inversely proportional to the free electron concentration. Such unusual dependence of** τ\n−1 versus n **has been clearly observed for a complex**\nconsisting of a substitutional boron atom and oxygen dimer in silicon [26, **81].**\nThe capture term in equation (50) is dominant when EF >\nE(−/+**). In this case,** τ\n−1 = ceff **and up to four specic terms**\nwith different values of activation energy and power dependence on n can occur, depending on the cX0 /ωXD **ratio and the**\nFermi level position with respect to E(0/+**). For a number of**\ndefects, e.g. bistable TDDs in Si and Ge crystals, under certain conditions, τ\n−1 ∼ n 2 **dependencies have been observed**\n[21, 78, 79, **82]. Such dependencies clearly show a two-fold** change in the charge state of a defect upon capture of carriers, so indicating its negative-U **properties.**\nFrom the analysis of temperature dependencies of transition rates between congurations of a defect with U < **0 monitored**\nby measurements of changes in either free carrier concentration or density of a specic defect state in semiconductor crystals with different n(p**), it is possible to elucidate the electronic**\nstructure of the defect and determine practically all its energy differences and transformation barriers. This has been done for a number of defects in Ge and Si crystals [21, 26, 64, **78–82].**\n4.2. Modelling Negative-U Defects\n4.2.1. Calculation of electronic transition levels. **The calculation of electronic transition levels is essentially a problem**\nof nding the energy of an electronic reservoir (Fermi level),\nfor which the exchange of electrons with a defective sample becomes energetically favourable (see section **3.3). This**\nis a topic which has been widely revised in the past (see for instance reference [49, **83]), so we leave here the essential features. We start by recalling equation (30), which determines the**\nenergy needed to create a defect in a crystal (defect formation energy)\n$$E_{\\rm f}^{(q)}({\\bf R},\\mu_{i},E_{\\rm F})=E^{(q)}({\\bf R})-\\sum_{i}n_{i}\\mu_{i}+qE_{\\rm F}.\\tag{53}$$\n(q)(R**) is the energy of a large portion of a sample**\nenclosing a single defect, including its electronic wave functions. The defective sample volume is made of ni **atoms of**\nspeciesi with chemical potential µi and collective atomic coordinate R = {Rα} (α **being an atomic index). It can be easily**\nshown that a transition energy level between charges states q and q\n′(with q **being more negative) is located at**\n$$E(q/q^{\\prime})=-\\,\\frac{E^{(q)}({\\bf R})-E^{(q^{\\prime})}({\\bf R}^{\\prime})}{q-q^{\\prime}}.$$\nEquation (54) accounts for the fact that charge states q and q\nmay correspond to radically different atomistic geometries R and R\nThe large chunk of material with a defect referred above is normally approximated to a defective supercell. The inherent periodic boundary conditions imply the cell to be neutral, even when we add (remove) electrons to (from) a defect state located in the gap. Technically, a uniform background countercharge of density −q/Ω (with Ω **being the supercell volume)**\nis superimposed to the electronic density. This implies that the aperiodic energy E\n(q)**that enters in equations (53) and (54),**\nis related to the periodic energy Ee(q) **obtained from the supercell calculation as** E\npcc **is a correction often referred to as** *periodic charge correction***. Several**\nschemes have been proposed for the calculation of E\nfor instance reference  and references therein).\nOf course, in a semiconductor, transitions are only observable if they are located in the range Ev < E(q/q\nhave therefore to calculate Ev or Ec **in order to cast the levels**\nas measurable quantities, i.e., E(q/q\n′) − Ev or Ec − E(q/q\nOne possibility is to assume that E{v,c} = ǫ{v,c},bulk**, which are**\nthe highest occupied (ǫv,bulk) and lowest unoccupied (ǫ**c,bulk**)\nstates of a single-particle Hamiltonian (like the Kohn–Sham equations). Another option is to follow the ∆SCF (delta selfconsistent eld) method to obtain Ev = Ee(0)\nbulk **from total energies of bulk supercells. These must**\nbe identical in size and shape to those used to obtain Ee(q)(R)\nvalues. In any case, we should be aware that the accuracy of the calculated defect levels, including the energies of the band gap edges, strongly depends on the quality of the Hamiltonian. Particularly important is the level of detail put in the description of the exchange and correlation interactions between electrons (see for instance reference ).\n4.2.2. Calculation of carrier capture cross-sections in multiphonon assisted transitions. **Inelastic scattering of free carriers by defects essentially consists of the transfer of energy and**\nmomentum of a propagating electron or hole, to another carrier bound to a defect (trap-Auger process), its conversion **into**\nradiation (luminescence process), into nuclear motion (e.g.\ncapture enhanced defect migration) or heat dissipation (multiphonon emission process) . Non-radiative capture of carriers via multi-phonon emission (MPE) is therefore a special case of inelastic scattering—the energy drop of the travelling carrier is fully dissipated into atomic vibrations. This is the most common capture mechanism at deep traps involving negative-U **defects. Other important processes, like recombination, generation or emission, can be described either as a**\nsequence of consecutive capture events, or by reversing the operation using detailed balance.\nThe relevant quantity to be evaluated is the carrier capture rate, cn/p, which relates to the apparent capture crosssection of equation (34) as cn = σnhvcith n **for the case of**\nelectrons (with an obvious analogous expression for holes).\nWhile rst-principles calculations of electronic transition levels have been routinely reported in the literature, the calculation of capture rates is clearly lagging behind. For a historical account regarding the development MPE theory, we divert the reader to references [58, 86, **87]. In general, the calculation**\nof the non-radiative transition rate between free and bound states starts with the description of a many-body Hamiltonian Hˆ and the choice of a practical basis to describe the total initial and nal wave functions involved, Ψi and Ψf**, respectively.**\nThe initial state represents the defect plus uncorrelated free carrier, whereas the nal state stands for the trapped state.\nThe *static approximation* **is a rather convenient starting point**\nin the context of popular electronic structure methods like Hartree–Fock and density functional theory. Here, the electronic wave functionsψs;R0\n(r) (s **being an electronic state index**\nand r **all electronic degrees of freedom) are found from a static**\n, constructed for a xed atomic geometry R0.\nThe nuclear wave functions are treated separately. Assuming the harmonic approximation, we write the initial state as Ψim = ψi;R0\n(r, {Qik})χim({Qik}**) and likewise, the nal state as**\n(r, {Qfk})χfn({Qfk}). Here, m and n **are quantum**\nnumbers for the vibrational states χi and χf**, respectively, while**\nk indexes are used to identify the 3N **individual vibrational**\nmodes Q{i,f}k, N **being the number of atoms in the sample.**\nThe transition probability between states Ψim and Ψfn relates to the off-diagonal matrix elements of the Hamiltonian when perturbed by a change in geometry (away from R0)\ninduced by the *promoting modes* {Qik} **of the initial electronic**\nstate. Such quantities may be obtained by rst-order expansion of Hˆ **in a Taylor series of** Qik (*linear coupling approximation*),\n$$\\Delta H_{\\rm im,fn}=\\sum_{k}\\left\\langle\\psi_{\\rm i,\\bf R_{0}}\\right|\\,\\frac{\\partial\\hat{H}}{\\partial Q_{\\rm ik}}\\left|\\psi_{\\rm f,\\bf R_{0}}\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle\\chi_{\\rm im}\\right|\\,\\Delta Q_{\\rm ik}\\left|\\chi_{\\rm fm}\\right\\rangle,\\tag{55}$$\nwhere ∆Qik = Qik − Q0k with Q0k **representing a generalised**\ncoordinate, equivalent to the collective nuclear coordinate R0 in the {Qik} **basis. The transition (capture) rate is then cast in**\nthe form of Fermi's golden rule,\n$$c=\\frac{2\\pi}{\\hbar}\\sum_{m,n}w_{m}(T)|\\Delta H_{\\rm im,fn}|^{2}\\delta(\\Delta E_{\\rm im,fn}),\\tag{56}$$\nwhich sums up all possible vibronic transitions, weighted by the occupancy fraction wm **of the promoting vibronic states.**\nUnder thermal equilibrium wm **is simply a normalised Boltzmann distribution. The allowed transitions in equation (56) are**\nalso restricted to those which conserve the energy, hence the use of a Dirac delta δ(∆Eim,fn) = δ(Ei − Ef + m~ωm − n~ωn).\nIn practice, the δ function is replaced by a normalised Gaussian function with full width ∼ kBT **to account for thermal**\nUp to this point, several bold approximations were already made. Still, the formulation of ∆Him,fn **as its stands in**\nequation (55), makes its calculation a rather cumbersome exercise. The problem lies essentially on the identication of the vibrational modes which lead to non-vanishing hχi|∆Qik|χfi terms. To give an idea, using a triply hydrogenated vacancy 32  \n(VH3**) defect in silicon as a benchmark, Barmparis and coworkers  used a Monte Carlo sampling scheme, being able**\nto nd convergence for ∆Him,fn **when about 12 distinct phonon**\nmodes, among millions, were considered.\nMotivated by the fact that a judicious choice of a single effective phonon mode resulted in a promising agreement between the observed and calculated luminescence intensity of radiative transitions (see for instance references [88, **89]),**\nseveral authors evaluated the transition matrix elements within the single-phonon approximation. Accordingly, the effective mode is the one that maximises the coupling to the distortion during the capture process,\n$$Q^{2}=\\sum_{\\alpha}m_{\\alpha}\\lambda^{2}|\\Delta\\mathbf{R}_{\\alpha}|^{2}.$$\nEquation (57) is a linear interpolation between initial and nal atomic coordinates ∆Rα = Rf,α − Ri,α with α **running**\nover all N atoms with mass mα**. The displacement amplitude**\nalong the effective mode is governed by a unitless factor 0 6 λ 6 1. The units of Q are amu1/2 **Å (amu being the atomic**\nmass unit). From the effective mode we arrive at the corresponding effective vibrational frequency ω{i,f} **of the initial or**\nnal states by extracting ω{i,f} = ∂E{i,f}/∂Q **from total energy**\ncalculations. With this in mind, equation (56) simplies into a factorisation of purely electronic and vibrational terms,\n$$c=\\frac{2\\pi}{\\hbar}W_{\\mathrm{if}}^{2}\\,G_{\\mathrm{if}}(T),$$\n$$(58)^{\\frac{1}{2}}$$\nwhere the transition matrix element is now Wif =\nhψi|∂Hˆ /∂Q|ψfi and Gif **is the temperature-dependent**\n$$G_{\\mathrm{if}}(T)=\\sum_{m,n}w_{m}(T)|\\langle\\chi_{\\mathrm{im}}|\\chi_{\\mathrm{fn}}\\rangle|^{2}\\delta(\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{im,fn}}).$$\nEquations (58) and (59) translate the Franck–Condon approximation**, which separates an instantaneous electronic** transition from the *sluggish* **phonon dissipation process**\nthat follows. The calculation of Gif **boils down to the**\nFrank–Condon integrals hχim|χfni **for all vibrational promoting and accepting states. For that, recursive techniques**\nhave been proposed [90–93] and applied on different contexts [88, 94, **95]. Sampling methods have also been applied**\n, although inclusion of a few phonons implied the evaluation of millions of hχim|χfni **congurations that matched the**\nelectronic energy off-set.\nRegarding the evaluation of Wif**, different approaches have**\nalso been used. Alkauskas *et al* ** replaced the many-body**\nHamiltonian and wave functions by single-particle counterparts ˆh and φ{i,f}**, which were taken from the Kohn–Sham**\nequations of density-functional theory. Thus, Wif **becomes**\n$$W_{\\mathrm{if}}=\\langle\\phi_{\\mathrm{i}}|\\partial\\hat{h}/\\partial Q|\\phi_{\\mathrm{f}}\\rangle,$$\nWif = hφi|∂ˆh/∂Q|φfi**, (60)**\nwhich can be solved by rst-order perturbation theory . Alternatively, a phenomenological approach was pursued by Krasikov *et al* ** who used equation (88) in the paper of**\nHenry and Lang ,\n$$\\left|W_{\\rm if}\\right|^{2}=\\frac{2\\pi}{\\Omega}\\left(\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2\\,m^{*}}\\right)^{3/2}\\epsilon^{1/2},\\tag{61}$$\nwhere Ω **is the crystal volume,** m\n∗**is the effective mass of the**\nfree carrier and ǫ **is the energy separation between the initial**\nand nal states near the intersection point (see discussion in section **3.5).**\n4.2.3. Calculation of transformation barriers. **Defect reorientation and transformation are important processes that**\noccur during the experimental characterisation of negative-U\ndefects. Understanding the underlying physics of such processes is fundamental in order to explain and ultimately to control defect behaviour. The problem is usually addressed in the spirit of transition state theory , and usually involves nding the lowest free energy barrier that separates specic reactants from products, or in the case of defects, initial from nal structures.\nAlthough being a rather challenging problem, particularly when we have no clue about the mechanisms involved, the search for a saddle-point along a potential energy landscape can be investigated in a number of ways. In general, defect transformation mechanisms are investigated via constrainedrelaxation of the atomistic structure, ideally using a highly accurate quantum-mechanical method to evaluate the forces. Among the existing algorithms we highlight:\nThe *dimer method* **, which requires knowledge of a single minimum energy conguration, performs a search for a**\nnearby saddle point. This method is particularly useful to look for saddle points along paths with unknown nal congurations. The dimer method works on two structures (the *dimer*)\nseparated by a small distance in congurational space. The direction along the lowest curvature of the potential energy is obtained by rotation of the dimer, and by nding the forces for each structure. This result is used to move the dimer uphill, from a stable conguration to a near saddle point.\nThe *Lanczos method* **was originally referred to as ART**\nalgorithm by Malek and Mousseau  and is a close relative to the dimer method. It can be used to search for a saddle point close to an arbitrary initial conguration. Unlike the dimer method, the Lanczos scheme estimates the Hessian eigenvector that corresponds to the lowest eigenvalue by expansion of the potential energy surface in a Krylov subspace. After this stage, the method proceeds in the same way as the dimer.\nThe *nudged elastic band* **(NEB)** *method* [99, **100] is a**\nrobust algorithm that works when the initial and nal states of the mechanism are known *a priori***. It basically involves the**\nrelaxation of a structure sequence (referred to as intermediate images) along the multi-dimensional path that separates the end-structures. Usually a starting guess for the intermediate images is obtained by linear interpolation of the end-structures. The latter are kept xed during the relaxation process. During the relaxation of each image, equal spacing between neighbouring images is maintained by inclusion of articial spring forces.\n![17_image_0.png](17_image_0.png)\nAn example of a defect-related mechanism studied using the NEB method is depicted in gure 10, showing the transformation of the bistable trivacancy (V3**) complex in Si .**\nThis is one of the most important radiation products in heavy particle irradiated Si . Right after irradiation the observed defect has the structure depicted in gure **10(a). The Si broken** bonds on this structure are responsible for several deep donor and acceptor levels observed by DLTS . However, storage for a few weeks of the irradiated Si samples at room temperature result in the transformation to the structure of gure **10(d).**\nThis is accompanied by the disappearance of the deep levels and the introduction of shallow electron traps at 75 meV\nbellow the conduction band bottom.\nThe energy barrier for the above transformation was estimated using the NEB method as 1.15 eV and 1.14 eV for neutral and negatively charged V3**, respectively . These**\ngures match very well their respective experimental counterparts of 1.16 eV and 1.15 eV .\n5. Showcase Of Negative-U **Defects And Their** Characterisation\nIn this section we provide some examples of negative-U **centres in widely used semiconductors. In the selection we try to**\nillustrate a range of behaviour, the convergence of theory and experiment, and cases which have provided particular challenges in understanding. Among this selection are examples of negative-U **centres which are of importance in semiconductor devices. The section is divided in two parts, rstly mini**\nreviews of published work on four defects, 1) BsO2 **(LID) complex in silicon, 2) atomic hydrogen in silicon, 3) DX centres**\n17 in III–V alloys and 4) The Ga–OAs**–Ga defect in GaAs. This**\nis followed by a table which covers a wider range of important negative-U **centres providing basic parameters and key**\nreferences. The table includes the four defects listed above and negative-U**defects referred to previously in the text to illustrate**\nparticular aspects of negative-U **behaviour, and theoretical and**\nexperimental challenges in their study.\n5.1. Bso2 (Lid) Complex In Silicon\nA complex consisting of a substitutional boron atom and an oxygen dimer (BsO2**) in Si was suggested to be responsible**\nfor light induced degradation (LID) of solar cells produced from silicon crystals, which contain boron and oxygen impurity atoms [103–105]. The suggestion was based on the experimental observations of linear and quadratic dependencies of concentration of recombination active defects responsible for LID on substitutional boron and interstitial oxygen concentrations, respectively [103, **104]. However, for almost two**\ndecades, there was no clear understanding of the electronic structure of the complex or the mechanisms of its formation and transformations . Answers to the above uncertainties have been found recently in a complex study consisting of a range of experimental techniques (various junction spectroscopy methods, photoluminescence, microwave detected photo-conductance decays) and *ab initio* modelling [26, **81],**\nwhere it was concluded that BsO2 has negative-U **properties.**\natomic congurations of the BsO2 **complex in different charge**\nstates. The negative-U **properties of the complex are related**\nto the transformations of the oxygen dimer in the vicinity of a substitutional boron atom between the so called 'squared' conguration (D and X in gure 11, with two three-fold coordinated oxygen atoms) and 'staggered' congurations (congurations A, A′, and A′′ in gure **11, with two-fold coordinated**\noxygen atoms). In p-type Si crystals when EF < Ev + 0.**3 eV,**\nthe BsO2 **centre is in the positive charge state (state D**+ in gure **11). In this state, the defect can either capture an electron** (created by either light or forward bias pulses) or emit a hole\n(thermally when the temperature is high enough) and transform to the shallow acceptor A− **state according to the following sequence of transitions: D**+ + h\n− + 2h+. Kinetics of the forward and back transitions between the D+ and A− **have been monitored at different temperatures in the p-type Si crystals with different hole**\nconcentrations and analysed with the use of equations (50), (51) and (52) [26, **81]. From this analysis, the values of energy** differences and barriers between different congurations **of the** complex have been derived.\nFurther, it has been found that upon relatively long\n(tens of hours at room temperature) minority-carrier-injection treatments the BsO2 defect transforms to a metastable conguration with a shallow acceptor level and stronger recombination activity (than that for Bs **and the A state of the B**sO2 complex). A possible mechanism of this transformation has been considered in reference . *Ab initio* **modelling results**\nhave shown the existence of two metastable shallow acceptor congurations (A′and A′′ congurations in gure **11) of**\n![18_image_0.png](18_image_0.png)\ntemperature implantation at T = **45 K was used by Holm **\nto study n-type Si using DLTS, and an Ec − E(0/+) = 0.**16 eV**\ndonor level (E3′**) was observed, being later ascribed to**\nbond-centred H(BC) . This was followed by detailed studies by Bonde-Nielsen *et al* ** on hydrogen near the T**\nsite, which quantied the impact of oxygen on nearby sites and determined the energy of the hydrogen acceptor to be Ec − E(−/0) = 0.**68 eV.**\nthe BsO2 complex . So, it appears that the BsO2 **complex is a multi-stable defect with at least three experimentally**\nconrmed atomic congurations for the neutral charge state\n(X0, A0, and A′0/A′′0**). Because of the existence of a rather**\nhigh energy barrier between the A′0/A′′0and A0congurations the metastable A′0/A′′0**congurations are long-living at**\nroom temperature. Only at temperatures above 150 ◦**C the**\n′′ → A/**D reactions occur efciently.**\n5.2. Atomic Hydrogen In Silicon\nHydrogen is a very common impurity in silicon. It is quite mobile at room temperature and extremely reactive in its atomic form. As a result, it readily combines with other impurities and itself, leaving only a small fraction of isolated **hydrogen atoms. These exist in three charge states and exhibit**\nnegative-U behaviour with the H-related (0/+**) donor level**\nlying above the (−/0) acceptor level, where neutral H0**is a**\nmetastable species . *Ab initio* **calculations predict that**\nboth H0and H+ **have minimum energy positions at the Si–Si**\nbond centre (BC), while H− **is located at an interstitial tetrahedral (T) lattice site . Representative structures are shown**\nin gure 12. The resultant negative-U **characteristic of isolated hydrogen is technologically very signicant, impacting**\n5.3. Dx Centres In Iii–V Alloys\nDX centres are a special case of negative-U **systems in which**\nthe addition of dopants, expected to form shallow donors in III–V alloys, gives rise to persistent photoconductivity and deep acceptors. The phenomenon was rst reported in detail by Craford *et al* in 1968  describing Hall effect measurements of GaAs1−xPx with x ≈ 0.**3 doped with Te or S.**\nThe phenomenon was erroneously believed to be the result of a donor 'D' reacting with an unknown defect 'X' to produce a deep state (hence 'DX'). This was a result of studies of AlxGa1−xAs with x > 0.**22 doped with Si, Ge, Sn, S,**\nSe or Te using Hall effect, photo-capacitance and DLTS (see for example references [16, **17]). The story of the DX centres is a classic research history spanning well over 25 years**\nstarting with a technological driver of achieving adequately high doping in III–V heterojunction lasers and transistors and involving some of the world's leading semiconductor groups combiningtheory and experiment. After many plausible explanations were explored it is now evident that the DX centre is a classic example of negative-U **behaviour. The saga up to 1990**\nhas been reviewed by Mooney  and some key issues are covered in the introductory section of the current paper.\nThe most extensively studied DX centre is that of Si in AlxGa1−x**As. DX behaviour is observed for the case where** x >\n0.**22 or at lower aluminium concentrations under hydrostatic**\npressure, for example DX behaviour of Si in GaAs is observed at pressures P > **2 GPa. In the DX conguration the silicon**\naccepts an electron and is negatively charged. The charge state has been determined experimentally by Dobaczewski *et al*\n from direct measurement of the capture cross section. As shown in gure **13, this change of charge state results in the** relaxation of the Si from its substitutional position on the **group** III site, to an interstitial site neighbouring three As atoms. In this siting, the Si does not act as a conventional thermally ionised donor and does not contribute to the conductivity.\nIf the system is exposed to light of a sufciently high energy, electrons are excited from the Si to the conduction band and the DX centre reverts to the substitutional site where it is a metastable neutral donor. At temperatures T < **180 K**\nthe electron does not have enough energy to surmount the barrier (Ea ∼ 0.2 eV) shown by the arrow in gure **13, and so**\nthe additional conductivity resulting from the shallow donor state induced by the light remains for hours or at lower temperatures for days or even weeks. This bizarre behaviour is referred to as persistent photoconductivity and is a signature of DX behaviour.\nThe identication of the substitutional-interstitial motion evolved from a sequence of calculations and experiments discussed in Mooney's review . However, a series of revealing experiments published subsequently provided unambiguous detail of this behaviour [116, **117]. In this work, high**\nresolution Laplace DLTS was analysed to provide detail of the inuence of the local environment on the electron thermal emission process from DX centres in a range of compositions 32  \n![19_image_0.png](19_image_0.png)\nof AlxGa1−x**As. The direct comparison of this process for centres related to Si which can replace gallium or aluminium,**\nwith that observed for a group-VI donor (tellurium), which resides in the arsenic sublattice, enabled the conguration of atoms to be determined when the centre is in the ground state.\nThis shows that the DX(Si) defect ionisation process is associated with interstitial-substitutional motion of the silicon atom.\nHowever, in the case of the DX(Te) centre, the spectra shows peaks from two groups which are attributed to interstitial substitutional motion of the neighbouring aluminium or gallium atoms, respectively.\nDX behaviour has been observed in many III–V and II–VI\nsemiconductors, and recently, persistent photoconductivity has been reported in oxides (e.g. ZnO and SrTiO3**), which has**\nbeen interpreted as DX behaviour associated with negative-U\ncharacteristics [118, **119].**\n5.4. The Ga–Oas –Ga Defect In Gaas\nThe Ga–OAs–Ga defect in GaAs is often referred to as substitutional oxygen (on the arsenic site) or arsenic-vacancyoxygen (VAs**–O) complex . It shows up as a group of three**\nlocal vibrational mode (LVM) absorption bands with identical ne structure. The bands, generally referred to as A, B′\nand B, appear at 731 cm−1, 714 cm−1and 715 cm−1**. Band B**′\nemerges during the intermediate stages of optical-induced **conversion from A to B using light with** hν > 0.**8 eV (below bandgap light). This was interpreted as an electron-transfer process**\nfrom EL2 to the conduction band, and subsequent capture by the Ga–OAs**–Ga complex. EL2 is an As antisite-related defect,**\nresponsible for a pinning E(0/+**) level, effectively working as**\na reservoir of electrons at Ec − 0.**75 eV . Hence, A, B**′\nand B bands were ascribed to LVMs of the same complex in charge states q, q − 1 and q − **2, respectively .**\nThe A and B bands were rst reported in semi-insulating material and assigned to EL2 by Song *et al* **. However,**\nthis connection could not be correct and was quickly supplanted by a model involving one O atom with two equivalent Ga–O bonds . That way, the triple-peak ne structure with intensity ratio of about 2:3:1 on each band (from high to low frequency peaks), could be explained by a combination of natural occurring Ga isotopes. Considering that 69**Ga and** 71Ga are found in a proportion of about 3:2, a natural population of 69Ga–X–69Ga, 69Ga–X–71Ga, and 71Ga–X–71Ga units corresponds to an intensity ratio of 9 : (2 × 6) : 4 = 2.**25 : 3 : 1,**\nrespectively [124, **125]. Based on sample history arguments** and semi-empirical calculations, the X element was suggested to be oxygen . This was conrmed shortly after with the observation of a 18**O-isotope shift of the bands by Schneider**\nand co-workers .\nBesides possessing a Ga–O–Ga unit with two equivalent Ga–O bonds, we know from stress-splitting FTIR absorption that the A band involves a h110i**-oriented vibration dipole**\n and the defect should have C2v symmetry. These experiments also concluded that Ga–OAs**–Ga does not reorient like**\nThe negative-U nature of the Ga–OAs**–Ga defect was**\nfound by Alt, who performed a series of enlightening experiments, combining Fourier-transform infra-red (FTIR) absorption, photo-excitation using monochromatic light with energy spanning the band gap and annealing [122, **127]. The** conguration coordinate diagram presented in gure 14 was constructed from the experimental data. Upon cooling the sample from room temperature to 10 K in dark, only band A was observed, indicating that this should be the ground state in semi-insulating GaAs (for EF = Ec − 0.**75 eV). State A is here**\nassumed to have a reference charge state q**, thus being referred**\nAfter applying a short pulse of light with 0.8eV < hν <\n1.**5eV, band A was partially quenched and that corresponded**\nto a proportional growth of band B′**. As referred to above,**\nthis was assigned to the photoionisation of EL2 followed by electron capture by Ga–OAs**–Ga. Importantly, band B was not**\nvisible at this point. This process is indicated in gure 14 **by the**\narrow heads with labels (1) and (2). The B′ **band was therefore**\nassigned to the q − **1 charge state (B**′q−1).\nApplying a 95 K dark annealing treatment to samples where only A and B′ **bands were present, led to the quenching of B**′\nand to the concurrent growth of bands A and B. The argument was that by warming the sample at 95 K, electrons bound to B\n′q−1 **were thermally promoted into the conduction band, thus**\nforming Aqagain (process with arrow head (5) in gure **14).**\nThe relatively small capture cross section of ionized EL2, also allowed free electrons to be captured by other B′q−1 **defects,**\nthus leading to the growth of band B. This was ascribed to the formation of a q − 2 charge state, namely Bq−2**(process**\nnumber (3) in gure 14). The activation energy for this conversion was measured as Ea = 0.**15 eV, and was assigned to**\nthe thermal emission barrier of B′q−1 → A\nAs pointed out by Alt , process (3) and (5) consisted on a disproportionation of metastable B′q−1 **with negative-**U\nordering of levels. It was also noted that full A → **B band conversion could be achieved by subjecting the samples for long**\n![20_image_0.png](20_image_0.png)\nillumination times with 0.**8 eV** < hν < 1.5 eV at T < **70 K.**\nAt these temperatures, the thermal emission channel (5) in gure 14 **was suppressed and all defects ended up in state B**q−2.\nAt higher temperatures (T > **180 K), band B starts to**\ndecrease in intensity at a rate identical to the recovery of band A. Full recovery of band A is achieved when B vanishes. This was suggested to result from a two-electron emission sequence B\nq + 2e−**, where the limiting step is the**\nrst one (with larger barrier). The above emission sequence is represented in gure 14 **as steps with arrow heads (4) and** (5), respectively. At these temperatures, the thermally emitted electrons were shown to be captured and trapped at the deeeper EL2 state (step (6) of gure **14). The activation energy for the**\nB → A conversion was measured as Ea = 0.**60 eV, thus suggesting that the binding energy of the second electron captured**\nby the Ga–OAs**–Ga defect, exceeded the binding energy rst**\nWe note that a more cautious analysis of the above picture would include the capture barriers for steps (2) and (3). DLTS measurements give activation energies of 0.58 eV and 0.14 eV\nfor electron emission from Bq−2and B′q−1**, respectively .**\nAs far as we are aware, capture barriers were not measured. However, judging from Hall effect measurements, which nd a disproportionating (q−2/q) transition at Ec − 0.**43 eV, and**\nconsidering the above emission barriers, the sum of rst and second capture barriers should be in the meV range . Also interestingly, based on its DLTS ngerprint, electron emission from Bq−2 **was assigned to EL3, a previously**\nknown deep trap with unknown composition .\nThe rst atomistic model claiming to account for the above data was a h001i**-displaced substitutional oxygen atom at the**\narsenic site (OAs) , resembling the vacancy-oxygen complex in silicon. OAs **possesses a Ga–O–Ga unit aligned along**\nthe h110i **direction, thus being compliant with the conclusions from the polarised absorption experiments . Jones**\nand Öberg  inspected the OAs **defect in H-terminated**\nGaAs spherical clusters using local density functional theory.\nAs **state was found to be metastable and**\nwas ascribed to band B′**. Bands A and B were therefore connected to diamagnetic states with O**−\nAs **and O**−3 As **, respectively.**\nWhile the calculations of reference  accounted for the experimentally observed red-shift of the oxygen vibrational frequency of B with respect to A, this result could not be reproduced by subsequent calculations [132–134]. Additionally, and perhaps more problematic for the OAs **model, is that**\nit cannot explain the lack of reorientation of the defect under the effect of uniaxial stress (although this was speculated **to be** due to a nearly isotropic stress tensor ).\nAlternatively, Pesola *et al* ** proposed a defect model**\nin which the two Ga radicals (not connected to oxygen) in the off-site OAs **defect are replaced by As. This complex** was referred to as (AsGa)2 –OAs **and incorporates a Ga–O–Ga** unit like in OAs**.

Electrical Levels Of Selected Negative-U Defects In\nsemiconductors Table 1 **lists the electronic characteristics of a selection of**\nnegative-U **defects in semiconductors. It should be noted that**\nthe table is not comprehensive. We only considered defects for which the negative-U **behaviour is conrmed by solid experimental results, where their electronic properties are relatively**\nwell understood and the atomic structures in different charge states have been predicted by experiments and *ab initio* modelling. Negative-U **properties have been suggested for a number of other defects in semiconductor materials, e.g., for interstitial boron-interstitial oxygen complex and hydrogen-related**\nshallow donors in silicon [76, **138]. Besides silicon, atomic**\nhydrogen has also been claimed to show negative-U **behaviour**\nin many other semiconductors [139, **140]. Further examples**\ncould be enumerated. However, no solid experimental evidence conrming these suggestions has been presented yet.\nPerhaps it is worth mentioning the interesting case of the Si trivacancy, which has been briey discussed in section **4.2.3.**\nIt has been argued in references  that V3 **in Si can**\nbe considered as a defect with negative-U **properties as it**\nhas the E(= /−) acceptor level at Ec − 0.**21 eV below the**\nE(−/0) level at Ec − 0.**07 eV. However, the levels mentioned** above are energy levels of V3 **in different congurations (part**\nof the hexagonal ring and four-fold coordinated shown in gures **10(a) and (d), respectively), which are separated by**\nrather high energy barriers. Because of these barriers the paired emission or capture of electrons (a signature of negative-U\ndefects) has not been observed for the V3 **defect, and therefore,**\nit has not been included into the table.\nThe transition levels of table 1 are cast as E(q/q+**1) and**\nE(q−1/q), where q **is a reference charge state. For negative-**U\ndefects E(q/q+1) > E(q−1/q), and the q charge state corresponds to the metastable state which, under equilibrium conditions, disproportionates into stable q + 1 and q − **1 charge**\n6. Conclusions\nThe present review begins with an historical perspective of the topic of 'negative-U **defects in semiconductors'. We start**\nfrom the early 1980s, where the rst reports of this class of defects emerged in the literature. The account includes several difculties identied at the time, mostly due to metastability, or in some cases multi-stability, of one of the three charge states involved. We provide the reader with an introduction to the essential physics of the workings of negative-U **defects (electronic correlation, electron–phonon coupling,**\ndisproportionation and defect transition levels). We present the state-of-the-art regarding the experimental and theoretical methods that are currently used for the characterisation of negative-U **defects. These subjects are presented in detail**\nand they are accompanied with several successful studies from the literature. This includes experimental methods based either on defect thermodynamics or defect kinetics (monitored by several techniques, like Hall effect, DLTS or optical absorption), as well as numerical methods that can help us in the construction of detailed conguration coordinate diagrams (with the calculation of transition levels, transition rates and transformation barriers). To wrap up, we showcase a few experimental and theoretical analyses of some of the most impacting negative-U **defects in group-IV and compound**\nsemiconductors, leaving a summary of the characteristics of many others, along with the most relevant references in a tabular format.\nA negative-U defect has a metastable state with N electrons that disproportionate into N − 1 and N + **1 species under**\nequilibrium conditions. This is only possible in many-atom systems, and thanks to the conversion of electron correlation energy into bond formation energy, either during ionisation or capture of carriers. In these defects, the stable N − **1 and**\nN + **1 states are normally diamagnetic close-shell systems,**\nmaking them unnoticeable by paramagnetic resonance techniques, unless some sort of excitation is provided to the sample. The metastability of the N-electron state works like a barrier separating the N − 1 and N + **1 species. When one of the**\nlatter is a shallow donor or a shallow acceptor, their occupation via deep-shallow excitation induced by illumination, usually results in a concentration increase of free carriers. This effect is often measurable as a persistent photoconductivity, which depending on the temperature, may last for several hours, until the defects surmounts a barrier associated with a charge capture event followed by transformation and return to the ground state conguration.\nThe above features make junction spectroscopy methods a primary choice for the characterisation of negative-U **defects**\nin semiconductors. However,the complexity of their behaviour often requires the usage of complementary techniques, as well as special tricks, like illumination or thermal quenching, **which**\nallow researchers to play with thermodynamics and kinetics, and by doing so, to isolate the defect in one of its three states, or to investigate the conversions between them. Defect modelling has also been pivotal. Since the pioneering work on the silicon vacancy, theories, numerical algorithms and hardware have evolved dramatically. Density functional related methods are perhaps the most successful cases. These have been able to provide us with a detailed quantum mechanical description of the interactions between trapped carriers and the many-body cloud of electrons comprising the defective semiconductor.\nFinally, we would like to emphasise the following concluding remark—we have achieved a rather deep understanding of the electronic and atomistic structure of many negative-U **defects in semiconductors. For sure, that was achieved**\nthanks to concurrent and combined experimental and theoretical work.\nJC thanks the support of the i3N project, references UIDB/50025/2020 and UIDP/50025/2020, nanced by the FCT/MEC in Portugal.

Bermundo, Ryoko Miyanaga, Mutsunori Uenuma\nNara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST), Nara , Japan\nAC stress was applied to the IWZO thin film transistor with high mobility, and its deterioration phenomenon was observed. As a result, a rare phenomenon in which the ON current deteriorates was observed. A deterioration model was proposed by reference experiments using DC stress, emission analysis using an emission microscope, and electric field distribution analysis using a device simulator. It was concluded that the deterioration is due to hot carriers that occur when the gate electric field changes from ON to OFF.\nthose in which electrical characteristic parameters fluctuate due to electric fields and heat due to electrical stress, and electrical characteristics fluctuate due to external atmosphere such as moisture and oxygen. There is a phenomenon. In addition, it has been pointed out that the photodegradation phenomenon caused by the application peculiar to the display. For them, our group has analyzed the phenomenon in detail and proposed a solution.\nThis time, we report a new hot carrier deterioration phenomenon when AC stress is applied to a thin film transistor with high electrical performance such as mobility . Since oxide thin film transistors are expected to be applied to circuits in the future, it is important to deepen the consideration of deterioration due to AC stress.\nOxide thin-film transistors, Reliability, Degradation, Display\n1. Introduction\nAmorphous oxide thin films are of great interest as channel films for next-generation display drive elements. As a typical material, a-InGaZnO is most often used . The reason is that although it is amorphous, high mobility can be obtained, it can be formed at a relatively low temperature by using a sputtering method, etc., and it is large unlike the low-temperature polycrystalline silicon thin film that requires laser crystallization. It can be formed on a substrate, and optical characteristics due to a wide bandgap exceeding 3.0 eV can be obtained. In addition, compared to low-temperature polycrystalline silicon thin film transistors, a low OFF leakage current of 6 orders of magnitude or more is also a great advantage as a display element.\nHowever, many issues have been pointed out for its reliability . The reliability deterioration phenomenon of oxide thin film transistors can be broadly divided into \n2. Experimental\nThis time, we prepared a thin-film transistor with a bottom structure using In-W-Zn-O (IWZO) as a channel film, applied AC stress, and discussed the deterioration mechanism . As mentioned above, a-IGZO is widely used for oxide thin film transistors, but in recent years, high mobility has been studied in response to the demand for higher performance of displays. As a candidate, we used a thin film transistor using IWZO as a channel film in the experiment . While a-IGZO generally has a mobility of 10 cm2 / Vs, this thin film transistor provides a relatively high mobility of 20-50 cm2 / Vs.\nAs shown in Fig.1, an IWZO film having a film thickness of 10 nm was formed on a silicon thermal oxide film (85 nm) by the RF sputtering method. This time, a low-resistance silicon substrate on which a thermal oxide film was formed in advance was used as the substrate. For the method of forming this thin film transistor, refer to Reference . The mobility of the thin film transistor used this time was 43 cm2 / Vs, the nearly and simple held at any other work on the context and context of the companies of the companies of the companies of the context of the context one of the context of the threshold value was -0.11 V, and the SS was 73 mV / dec.\nAC stress with an amplitude of 20 V, a frequency of 500 kHz, a duty ratio of 50%, and a rise / fall time of 100 ns was applied to this transistor. In order to eliminate deterioration due to DC voltage, the source / drain is\n3. Results\nThe state of the deterioration is shown in Fig.1. The threshold fluctuation before and after the stress of 10000 seconds was + 0.18V. On the other hand, the decrease in ON current was remarkable. Although there are reports of applying AC stress to oxide thin film transistors , such deterioration phenomena have not been reported so far. The deterioration phenomenon so far has been dominated by fluctuations in the threshold value. In addition, even when positive voltage, negative voltage, or optical stress is applied to the gate, the fluctuation of the threshold value in the positive and negative directions of the gate is dominant, and no decrease in ON\ncurrent has been reported [ 7].\nIn order to clarify the mechanism of this deterioration phenomenon, additional experiments were attempted using a similar TFT. The same amplitude was applied by direct current (+ 20V, -20V), and the deterioration phenomenon was investigated. The results are shown in Fig.2. The thresholds shifted slightly with respect to +\n2V DC stress and -20V DC stress, but there was almost no deterioration in ON current or SS. By the way, from these results, it can be seen that this transistor has extremely high reliability against voltage stress. Fig.2 Changes in input characteristics with respect to electrical stress (a) Vg = + 20V, (b) Vg = -20V, (c) Vg =\nTherefore, it was found that this deterioration phenomenon is a deterioration peculiar to AC stress.\nThat is, it was judged that this is a phenomenon that appears when the voltage changes from ON to OFF and from OFF to ON (at the time of transient). In addition, these deteriorations did not show a phenomenon of recovery even after the AC stress was stopped.\nFig.3 shows the experimental results of Fig.2 as changes in the threshold value, changes in SS, and changes in the ON current over time. From these figures, it was clearly shown that the aspect of deterioration was different from that of DC stress. Again, it is highlighted that the difference from DC stress is that the threshold fluctuation is small, and the deterioration of SS and the deterioration of ON current are remarkable.\n(c) Id an emission microscope. See reference  for more \n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png) information on this analysis method. We have previously reported that when a high drain electric field is applied to an oxide thin film transistor, weak light emission in the visible region is observed. When observing the light emission using a CCD camera, the wavelength spectrum was also measured at the same time using a bandpass filter. As shown in Fig.4, light emission in the visible region was observed by applying AC stress. Therefore, it was presumed that hot carriers were generated when this AC stress was applied. From the wavelength spectrum using the bandpass filter, it was found that the light emission had an energy of 1.5 eV or more.\nFurthermore, in order to discuss the deterioration \nmechanism, as shown in Fig.5, the electric field distribution when AC stress was applied was estimated using the device simulator ATLAS . At the same time, the measured output characteristics are also shown. It can be seen that when -20V is applied, a very high electric field of -0.7MV / cm is symmetrically generated on both sides of the source / drain. However, as described above, deterioration does not occur when a DC stress of -20V is applied, so this electric field alone cannot explain it.\n4. Discussion\nBased on the analysis results so far, we consider the ON current deterioration observed when AC stress is applied to the IWZO thin film transistor, and propose a deterioration model.\nCompared with the result of DC stress, it was found only in AC stress, so it was judged that the deterioration phenomenon occurred when the internal electric field changed, that is, during the transient. In addition, from the luminescence analysis, luminescence was observed with deterioration, so it is judged that hot carriers are generated. That is, it is considered that hot carriers are generated when the electrons gathered in the channel at the time of ON are exposed to the high electric field at the time of OFF, and the hot carriers cause defects in the vicinity of the drain. Deterioration may occur from OFF to ON, but this seems to be small. This is because when it is OFF, there are almost no electrons in the channel, and when it is ON, a high electric field is not generated, so that there is little possibility that hot carriers will be generated.\nThis hot carry presumes that traps that capture electrons are formed at local locations near the source and drain. Since the recovery phenomenon is not observed even after the stress is stopped, further analysis is required to consider whether it is formed in a deep energy position or not.\n5. Conclusion"

Introduction\nStudies on thin-film transistors (TFTs) using metal oxide semiconductors1,2) have been carried out for a long time, but after the report by Ref. 3 in 2004, research on amorphous oxide TFTs rapidly increased. In addition, research by Ref. 4 in 2006 has further accelerated the research towards practical application. Today, the mass production of metal oxide semiconductors has begun as a driving transistor for LCD\nand organic EL. Furthermore, various research is being carried out with the goal of increasing its performance, improving reliability and reducing the cost.\nCompared to amorphous Si5–7) and low-temperature polycrystalline Si,8–16) which have been put into practical use up to now, metal oxide TFTs suffer from specific deterioration phenomena, which have been reported by various researchers. In this paper, we outline our observations of various degradation phenomena against electrical bias stress under DC and AC voltage, discuss several mechanisms that induce the deterioration of oxide TFT reliability, introduce innovative methods to process gate insulation film and protective film to improve reliability, and propose a new evaluation technique using an IR microscope, with the purpose of further enhancing the reliability and performance of oxide TFTs.\n2. Degradation Phenomena Of Amorphous-Oxidesemiconductor Tft By Constant Voltage Bias Stress\nDegradation by electrical stress in metal oxide semiconductor has been one of the critical issues in the development of thinfilm devices.17–38) Several previous studies on the reliability of TFTs using ZnO for the semiconductor layer have been reported,17,18) but for the first time we report the degradation by applying a positive bias voltage to the gate of amorphous InGaZnO (a-IGZO) TFT. We observed the degradation phenomena characterized by the positive parallel shift of the transfer characteristics after positive gate bias application and proposed the degradation mechanism.19) As shown in Fig. 1, when a positive voltage was applied to the bottomgate-type a-IGZO TFT with a nitride film as the gate insulating film, a change in its transfer characteristic was observed. Figure 2 shows that the transfer curve was shifted parallel to the positive direction and the variation of threshold voltage was large. In addition, the amount of threshold value\nincreased with the increase of the applied voltage. The level of degradation was observed to be in a linear relationship with the stress time duration. The gradient became more moderate when increasing the stress voltage. In addition, as shown in Fig. 3, changing the gate length and width, yields different deterioration rates in threshold voltage shift, but almost minimal change in the slope was observed. As for the absolute amount, the larger the gate width and length were, the larger the absolute amount of voltage shift was observed.\nNext, when the electric bias stress was applied and subsequently removed, recovery behavior was seen. As shown in Fig. 4, the deteriorated transfer characteristics induced by the positive bias stress (PBS) application for 10000 s are almost recovered after leaving the TFT without any bias for 10000 s. The recovery amount of the threshold was also linear with respect to time. Therefore, based on the 090502-1 © 2019 The Japan Society of Applied Physics\nexperimental results, the degradation mechanism was considered as follows. Unlike Si-based TFTs, the change in threshold voltage seen in a-IGZO TFT is thought to be caused by the trapping of electrons at the interface due to gate bias stress. Since it is almost recovered by just leaving the TFT after stress application, the degradation is caused by traps existing at a very shallow energy level. In addition, it is considered that a new density of state (DOS) due to the bias stress could not be formed, since the slope of the transfer characteristic hardly changed with respect to stress application, as shown by the parallel shifting. Device simulation based on this model demonstrated the deterioration phenomena. In the device simulation, a clear threshold voltage shift was observed by increasing the shallow trap density.\n3. Improvement Of Reliability By Fluorinated Nitride Film\nFor improving the reliability against bias stress, we proposed a fluorinated nitride film by introducing fluorine into the gate insulating film during deposition.39) From our initial experimental results of film deposition using various kinds of gases, we found that fluorine strongly correlates with superb reliability against the bias stress of oxide TFT. Inductivelycoupled plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (ICPCVD) using SiF4 /N2 as the source gas was adopted. As a result, we fabricated a-IGZO TFTs with a high-quality fluorinitride film as a gate insulating film and succeeded in suppressing the shift in the threshold voltage. Changes in transfer characteristics against bias stress were measured using a TFT with a bottom-gate top-contact structure, as shown in Fig. 5. In order to confirm the effects of fluorine and hydrogen, the fabrication conditions, as shown in Table I,\nwere prepared. As a reference, a conventional nitride film containing hydrogen was also prepared. This conventional film was deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) at 400 °C to control the hydrogen content. If this film is deposited at lower temperature, the large amount of hydrogen will cause unstable TFT operation.\nThe distribution of hydrogen in the fluorinated silicon nitride film was investigated by secondary-ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and it was found that 3.6 × 1020 atom cm−3 of hydrogen, which was about 1/10 of the conventional SiN\nfilm, was uniformly distributed throughout the entire film.\nFigure 6 shows the results of the bias stress experiment of the TFT characteristics with the above four conditions. SiN:H, which is the conventional condition [Fig. 6(a)], has a threshold shift of about 2.5 V. For the fluorinated nitrogen, considerable improvement is observed against a bias stress of\n| Table I.   | Fabrication conditions of each gate insulator.39)   |                         |\n|------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Sample     | Gas ratio                                           | Fabrication temperature |\n| SiN:F      | SiF4/N2 = 1/18                                      | 150 °C                  |\n| SiN:F + F  | SiF4/N2 = 1/6                                       | 150 °C                  |\n| SiN:F + H  | SiF4/N2 = 1/18 + H2 8%                              | 150 °C                  |\n| SiN:H      | SiH4/NH3 = 2/3                                      | 400 °C                  |\n10000 s with SiN:F [Fig. 6(b)] and SiN:F + H [Fig. 6(c)],\nhaving threshold shifts of 0.8 and 1.6 V, respectively.\nCompared to these three conditions, the shift amount also decreases as the hydrogen content further decreases.\nFurthermore, in the case of SiN:F + F [Fig. 6(d)], the shift amount was 0.1 V or less. In comparison, the threshold voltage shift of the a-IGZO TFT using SiO2 as the gate insulating film was 0.6–0.8 V, which further demonstrates the superior effectiveness of the fluorinated nitride film.\nThe mechanism was discussed as follows. In the fluorinated insulating film, the hydrogen content is smaller compared with the usual nitride film. The introduction of fluorine promotes reduction of the interface state density.\nFrom the analysis of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)\nat both the a-IGZO surface and its interface with the fluorinated SiN film, fluorine bonding with the metal was 090502-2 © \nobserved, which terminated the oxygen vacancies in the oxide-semiconductor film. Reference 40 further investigated this mechanism for improved reliability after fl uorine incorporation in the gate insulating film. The results and analysis indicate that the incorporated fl uorine exists at the interface in the form of In-F x and In-OF, as shown in Fig. 7 , leading to the reduction of the interface state. The reduction of the bonding states at the IGZO and gate insulator interface resulted in the decrease of the number of tail states near the conduction band minimum.\nDegradation By Negative Bias Illumination Stress 4. (Nbis)\nThe phenomenon where the threshold voltage is greatly shifted to the negative direction when light irradiation is applied while applying negative bias is a typical degradation phenomenon observed in oxide TFT. Many reports have also been published on this issue. 41 -66 ) Reference 41 investigated the effect of irradiating gallium-indium-zinc-oxide (GIZO)\nTFT with light, while applying negative voltage. This stress combination greatly accelerated the threshold voltage shift in the negative direction. This is directly attributed to the fact that carriers induced by light are trapped at the interface between the gate insulating film and semiconductor, and this phenomenon is reported to be accelerated depending on the environmental conditions, such as moisture. Reference 42 observed photodegradation phenomena by irradiating a-\nIGZO TFT with light at various wavelengths and electric power. It is confirmed that the shift of the threshold voltage depends on an increase in electric power, irradiation time and a decrease in wavelength. Reference 43 proposed that oxygen vacancies acting as hole traps are the main cause of light-bias degradation. They proposed a model in which optically excited holes move to the channel/insulating film interface and are captured in oxygen vacancies (Vo) in the dielectric layer. Since IGZO is amorphous, Vo 2+ defects are less likely to revert to their original defect state. Moreover, even if electrons are trapped, the shallow defect level is maintained.\nIn addition, this shows that additional heat treatment removes hole traps and is effective for recovering the device reliability.\nReference 46 observed that the threshold voltage shifts by just irradiating light at 365 nm on the oxide-semiconductor channel. The deterioration depends on the thickness of the active layer, and the TFT with a thickness of 20–50 nm exhibits a large change, which was further aggravated by the bias. It is considered that this phenomenon is caused by a metastable state induced by light and that the state is related to ionized oxygen vacancies. Reference 47 compared negative bias illumination degradation using an a-IGZO TFT\nhaving SiO 2 and SiNx as a gate insulating film. As a result, a very large threshold shift is observed in the SiNx TFT. The reason is that the trapping level, which exists abundantly at the SiNx interface, captures the photoexcited holes. Through this method, the trapping is greatly recovered even at RT and almost wholly recovered after heat treatment at 250 °C, so the trap is considered to be temporary.\n© 2019 The Japan Society of Applied Physics Reference 48 estimated the sub-gap state generated by photodegradation from the evaluation of the light-bias deterioration phenomenon by examining the capacitance–\nvoltage (C–V ) characteristics. The level is due to ionized oxygen vacancies. Furthermore, it is considered that photoexcitation from Vo to stable Vo2+ supplies free electrons to the conductor and the increased electron further accelerates the negative voltage shift. Reference 50 observed a large negative voltage shift by irradiating a TFT having Hf-In-ZnO (HIZO) as an active layer with UV light. This is because UV light contributes to the generation of defects, which are trapping sites for the photoinduced holes and the generated oxygen vacancies capture holes induced by UV light, thereby forming dual oxygen vacancies (Vo2+).\nReference 52 analyzed the dependence of the light-bias degradation with the film thickness (20, 50 and 100 nm) of the active layer. The results of the current–voltage characteristic (I–V ) and the capacitance–voltage (C–V ) point to the formation of double donors (Vo2+) in the bulk associated with oxygen vacancies. Moreover, from the C–V characteristics, it is confirmed that the gap level (Ec - E) is broadly distributed from 0.3–1.0 eV. Reference 53 investigated the temperature dependence of the photodegradation phenomenon and estimated that the deterioration accelerated as the temperature increased and its activation energy was 1.06 eV.\nIn addition, they can describe the change of threshold with a stretch exponential function and their study suggests that oxygen deficiency is involved in its mechanism.\nReference 54 reported that light-bias degradation is generated by light irradiation under the application of a negative voltage and its origin is a hole trap such as oxygen vacancies. They analyzed the effect of hydrogenation on NBIS degradation using first principles calculations. They insist that oxygen vacancies causing NBIS are passivated by hydrogen because oxygen vacancies (Vo) replaced by hydrogen (Ho) are more stable than when bonded in the gap. The desorption of hydrogen from Ho and the diffusion energy of hydrogen at the interface (Hi) are calculated to be 1.27 and 0.51 eV,\nrespectively. Also, since Ho defects are stable after heat treatment up to 200 °C, it is concluded that hydrogenation not only reduces oxygen vacancies, but has the effect of suppressing NBIS. Reference 55 found that recovery phenomena against light-bias degradation is accelerated by PBS,\nbased on I–V characteristics and C–V characteristics of TFTs.\nWhen the trapped positive charge is released, the ionized oxygen vacancy is neutralized by electron capture and recovers to its original deep level.\nReference 66 discussed the degradation under NBIS in aInGaZnO TFT. They made a-IGZO TFT on a glass substrate, applied a combination of negative bias stress (NBS) and light irradiation (NBIS) and evaluated the change of DOS of the TFT. For an NBIS of −20 V, the threshold voltage shifted towards the negative direction, but an increase of shallow states expected as positively ionized oxygen vacancies (Vo+ or Vo++) were not observed in the DOS curve. On the other hand, for NBIS of −30 V, change in the DOS near the conduction band edge before and after applying a bias stress was observed. This suggests that Vo+ or Vo++ was generated by NBIS, but the accumulation of holes at the a-IGZO/SiO2 interface mainly caused the threshold voltage shifts, as shown in Fig. 8.\n5. Reliability Improvement By Protective Film With Siloxane\nNumerous studies have been undertaken where attempts have been made to reduce the deterioration of the characteristics of oxide-semiconductor TFTs through a protective film.67–89)\nReference 67 investigated the influence of atmospheric air on a-IGZO TFT. In ambient air, the threshold value was −7 V.\nAs the degree of vacuum increased from the outside air, the threshold voltage shifted to negative voltage, while the threshold voltage shifted to the positive direction as the oxygen pressure was increased. The reason for this is that adsorption of oxygen to the back interface forms a depletion region and the carrier concentration varied in the range of 1 × 1019 to 1 × 1020 cm−3. Reference 68 fabricated ZnO\nTFTs at atmospheric pressure using an atomic layer deposition (ALD) process with a process temperature below 200 °C.\nThey reported superior characteristics against PBS by depositing 100 nm of Al2O3 as passivation.\nReference 69 investigated the effect of moisture on the aIGZO TFT. Water diffused into the a-IGZO thin film, thereby reversibly changing the transistor characteristics. Depending on film thickness, two competitive mechanisms are clarified.\nFor films thicker than 100 nm, additional electrons were introduced due to the absorption of moisture, while acceptortype behavior induced by moisture is observed in thin films of 70 nm or less. This direct proof is indicated by the marked deterioration of the S value in the 30 nm thin a-IGZO thin film. Reference 70 irradiated the backside of a-IGZO with N2O plasma to prevent the removal of In-rich regions and entry of hydrogen. As a result, they obtained high mobility of 37 cm2 V−1 s\n−1 and S value of 0.25 V decade−1.\nReference 71 examined the effectiveness of passivation layers by using organic photo acryl (PA) and a-IGZO TFT\nwith PECVD-SiO2 passivation. Compared with PA, TFT with SiO2 passivation showed excellent control of the threshold shift and S value change against PBS. As a mechanism for causing a positive threshold voltage shift when a positive bias is applied, adsorption of oxygen molecules from the atmosphere captures electrons in aIGZO and positively charged water molecules on the surface desorbs. Therefore, this showed that threshold shift can be suppressed by sufficient passivation of the IGZO back channel. Reference 72 investigated the effect of adding water to the annealing atmosphere of a-IGZO TFT. Dry O2 090502-4 © \nannealing improved the mobility and S value, but wet O2 annealing further improved mobility to 12 cm2 V−1 and S value to 0.12 V decade−1. The elimination of hydroxyl groups promoted the improvement of conductivity. Zn–O\nbonds began to desorb from the dry O2 annealing at about 300 °C, but in the wet O2 annealing they were considerably suppressed.\nReference 73 investigated the change in threshold voltage of a-IGZO TFT under constant current stress. The TFT was fabricated at RT and was either annealed in a dry O2 atmosphere at 400 °C or a wet O2 atmosphere. All the thresholds indicated a positive shift and the shift amount was suppressed by annealing. By performing TFT simulation, threshold variation is explained by deep-level defects and large shifts in TFTs without annealing are explained by increased shallow levels. Reference 74 evaluated the threshold shift for gate bias stress in vacuum, hydrogen, oxygen and air atmosphere. As a result, the change in the hydrogen atmosphere was more conspicuous compared with oxygen. The reason for this is that an accumulation layer is formed on the a-IGZO surface after exposure to hydrogen.\nReference 75 evaluated the reliability of a-IGZO TFT with paraffin wax as passivation. This film can be formed by the sol–gel method under atmospheric pressure and it has high yield at low cost. This TFT exhibits a low threshold fluctuation with respect to moisture, oxygen, air and the like. In addition, changes in characteristics were small with respect to light irradiation. From the analysis, it is established that this is influenced by the low DOS. Reference 76 performed experiments to passivate electron traps in aIGZO film with hydrogen. Annealing at 300 °C showed good operating characteristics, but it deteriorated at 400 °C or more. Thermal desorption spectra of water shows that the critical point of temperature is related to water desorption.\nThe re-doping of hydrogen by wet oxygen annealing shows a recovery to achieve excellent TFT characteristics. The binding energy of hydrogen that passivates the trap corresponds to desorption at 300 °C–430 °C. The model was proposed from these results.\nReferences 77–79 demonstrated that a-IGZO TFT with passivation based on polysilsesquioxane (PSQ) has strong reliability against PBS, NBS and light-illumination bias stress. They explain that hydrogen from the PSQ film reduced oxygen vacancies and carbon forms acceptors in IGZO.\nPhotosensitive polysilsesquioxane (P-PSQ) was also developed as a passivation film and was deposited by solution process via spin coating. For P-PSQ, no dry etching is required to form contact holes which circumvent the adverse effect associated with dry etching. Figure 9 shows the transfer characteristic shift of the TFT with P-PSQ as the passivation film due to the PBS and NBS. For comparison, a bias stress test was also carried out using a TFT having no P-PSQ\npassivation film. The TFT with P-PSQ shows considerably good stability. After 10000 s, the threshold shift was as small as 0.5 V. In contrast, TFTs with no passivation film shifted significantly by 5 V against PBS. Furthermore, small degradation in the subthreshold region was observed after 10000 s, which suggests additional defects and trap levels. Also, for NBS, the amount of change in TFT without passivation film is small, but a clear hump phenomenon was observed.\nFurthermore, a humidity test was carried out. Although the\ntransfer characteristics of TFTs with P-PSQ hardly changed, in the absence of a passivation film, a shift of the threshold voltage value to the negative direction was observed. As a result of SIMS analysis, high H and F were confirmed in aIGZO in TFT having P-PSQ, as shown in Fig. 10. They considered that this high concentration of hydrogen and fluorine reduces Vo.\nReference 80 demonstrated that Al2O3 films deposited by the ALD method are effective passivation films for a-IGZO\nTFTs. By using dimethylaluminum hydride (DMAH), which has only two methyl groups as ALD material, there are fewer impurities such as carbon and film with a high deposition rate can be formed, as shown in Fig. 11. For the positive gate bias of 20 V for 10000 s, considerably smaller threshold voltage shift was observed for TFT with DMAH compared with trimethylaluminum hydride (TMA). The reasons for showing 090502-5 © \nhigh reliability against PBS compared with TMA, which is a conventional material, are as follows. Due to the XPS\nanalysis, the bonding ratio of M-Vo is decreasing, which is likely due to hydrogen from DMAH passivating Vo in the aIGZO film.\n6. Degradation Phenomenon Due To Ac Stress\nIn TFTs used for driving displays, a pulse voltage is applied to an electrode for both LCDs or OLEDs. Therefore, it is very important to confirm the change in performance when AC\nvoltage is applied. Reference 90 evaluated the deterioration phenomena against AC stress by applying pulse stress using a-IGZO TFT. They observed degradation phenomena for S\nvalues that are not typically observed under DC bias stress. As for deterioration, it is considered that electrons with high energy form a level at the interface during the rising edge of the gate pulse. Figure 12 shows the change in the transfer characteristics when ±20 V is applied to the gate electrode of the a-IGZO TFT using SiN gate insulator film and 0 V is applied to the source and drain electrodes (Vd = 0 V). As time passes, the threshold changes in the negative direction and deterioration of the S value can also be observed. Figure 13 shows the change in S value for various pulse conditions.\nWith the DC voltage of Vg = 20 V and Vg = −20 V, the S\nvalue hardly changes, but only increases with the application of pulse with time. Also, the level of change increases with increasing frequency. In order to investigate the cause of deterioration, the degradation amount was observed by changing the rise and fall time, as shown in Fig. 14. From\nthese comparisons, it was obviously dependent on the fall time and it was found that the sharper the pulse the greater the TFT deteriorates. Therefore, they explain the deterioration mechanism as follows. When a positive bias is applied to the gate, electrons are induced at the interface and subsequently trapped at the interface. The captured electrons are released when they are negatively biased. Device simulation showed that a high electric field is generated at the source and drain when a negative bias is applied. Therefore, they considered that the emitted electrons are accelerated by this high electric field and further create interface states. In the case of rise time, electrons gather to the channel by PBS. However, the electric field is not so high and electrons are not accelerated to create the interface. So they concluded that degradation was clearly observed at falling time.\n7. Thermal Degradation And Its Analysis Using An Ir Microscope\nHeat generation phenomena have been proposed as a cause of TFT deterioration.91–95) Reference 91 observed the heat generation phenomena using amorphous InSnZnO (aITZO). For thermal analysis, an IR microscope (Infra Scope) using InSb as a detector was used. They investigated in detail the non-uniformity of heat generation in the gate direction and the size dependence. Figure 15 shows the state of heat generation when the Vd and the Vg are varied. The higher the gate voltage and drain voltage, the higher the heat generation temperature. When Vg = Vd = 30 V, the maximum temperature of 150 °C is observed. Although the 2D distribution is shown in Fig. 15, it can be observed that the peak of heat generation is asymmetric and leaned towards the drain side. When Vd > Vg, it was biased towards the drain side and symmetrical when Vd < Vg.\nNext, changes are observed in transfer characteristics when Vg = Vg = 20 V are applied to the ITZO TFT. As shown in Fig.  16 , within the first 100 s, the transfer characteristics shift positively and then shift in the negative direction. The heat generation temperature also decreased in the first 10 s and then increased gradually. They discussed the mechanism, as shown in Fig. 17 . Due to the high V d , impact ionization occurs and electrons move to the interface between the semiconductor and insulating film. In addition, holes diffuse to the back channel and are trapped. Initially, the trapping of electrons is the main factor that causes positive threshold shift and decrease in heat generation. Then, hole trapping at the back channel becomes dominant, resulting in a negative threshold shift and an increase in heat generation. Nevertheless, the capture of holes at the back channel region, especially near the source and drain edge, also causes hump formation. The hole capture induces the creation of a parasitic transistor that turns on faster than the main transistor, thus creating the hump that is especially prevalent for TFTs operating in enhancement mode (normally OFF TFTs). Thus, this is the first report of the hot carrier phenomenon in metal oxide semiconductors.\nFurthermore, Ref. 92 expanded on the discussion of the influence of heat generation using TFT with various lengths and widths. As a result, the heating effect strongly depended on the channel scale and severe threshold voltage shift and high heating temperature were observed for wider TFT. They concluded that reliability was affected by the accumulation of heat in wider TFT.\n8. Heat Deterioration Phenomenon Due To Ac Stress\nReference 96 investigated the deterioration phenomenon due to heat in a-IGZO TFT by using an IR microscope. By using the pseudo-interval measurement method, changes in heat generation phenomena for various operating frequencies are observed and the deterioration mechanism accompanying heat is discussed. By introducing the pseudo-interval measurement method, they succeeded in improving the measurement frequency (13.2 Hz) of the original device and it was above the measurement limit of the thermal analysis system. The principle is shown in Fig. 18. By shifting the frequency of the pulse applied to the element and the frequency of the CCD camera, it is understood that heat generation can be observed in sampled form. Figure 19 shows the relationship between frequency and temperature. At a low frequency of 10 Hz or less, the maximum and minimum temperature of the device show the values at the time of application of the respective DC\nvoltage, but when the frequency is further raised, it becomes impossible to follow the temperature change. At 1 kHz or more, the highest and lowest temperature are in agreement. Its value became the median value at low frequency. Therefore, how the heat generation affects the characteristics of the device was investigated, as shown in Fig. 20.\nWhen pulses of 10 Hz and 1 kHz which changed the heat generation temperature were applied, the threshold voltage shifted in the positive direction at both frequencies, but the shift amount was larger at 10 Hz. Thus, this difference is thought to be caused by heat generation inside the TFT. The mechanism is discussed as follows. When a voltage is applied to the gate and the drain, electrons are accelerated by the electric field and they are captured at the interface between the semiconductor and insulating film, causing a threshold voltage shift. However, as the heating temperature is higher, the electron trapping is accelerated. At low frequency (10 Hz), the temperature at ON is higher than at high frequency (1 kHz). Therefore, considering the heat generation during operation is important for improving\n9. Summary\nWe reviewed the countermeasures for improving the reliability against electrical stress relating to TFTs using oxide semiconductors, focusing on the research content that we have been working on so far. First, we outlined the degradation phenomena and mechanism in IGZO TFT when a positive voltage was applied to the gate. It is concluded that the deterioration is mainly caused by electron injection into the shallow interface state, because the transfer characteristic is shifted in parallel and because the recovery phenomenon is observed when we stopped the stress. As a countermeasure for the degradation, a gate insulating film containing fluorine was proposed. From XPS analysis, we concluded that fluorine has an oxygen deficiency suppressing effect. Then, we examined the degradation mechanism due to the application of simultaneous light and NBS, which induces a large negative shift of the threshold value by analyzing the interface state through C–V measurement. In addition, in order to suppress deterioration against electrical bias, the introduction of a protective film using siloxane was proposed.\nWe proposed that the key reaction is the reduction of oxygen 090502-8 © \ndefects by hydrogen from the protective film. Furthermore, we proposed the deterioration mechanism when AC stress is applied as electrical stress and a new degradation phenomenon when heat generation occurs. Thermal analysis using IR\nhas proved that not only the temperature distribution of the device can be accurately determined, but the precise change in temperature while in actual operation.\nThe reliability improvement methods and evaluation techniques introduced in this paper will greatly contribute to the future development of next-generation flexible devices using oxide semiconductors.\nThe authors thank Prof. M.

The functionalities of oxide semiconductors have been explored extensively in recent decades,6) and industrial applications such as thinfilm transistors7–9) and transparent electrodes10) have been realized. Semiconductors doped with magnetic impurities, which are referred to as dilute magnetic semiconductors, have been developed toward spintronic applications.11–13) These technologies typically rely on heterostructures fabricated under precisely controlled conditions, where understanding and tailoring of lattice defects, including point defects (native defects, residual impurities, and dopants), dislocations, surfaces, and interfaces, are essential, as well as knowledge of fundamental bulk properties, because such defects affect or even dominate device performance. A fair amount of experimental research on lattice defects has therefore been conducted, in addition to characterization of bulk properties.\nHowever, lattice defects are often difficult to fully access by experiment, especially at the atomistic and electronic levels, and computational approaches complement experimental investigation. Historically, lattice statics and molecular dynamics simulations using empirical interatomic potentials have been widely applied to defect modeling.14–16)\nBecause it typically requires large simulation cells, computationally demanding approaches were infeasible in the past.\nThe recent development of electron theory and relevant computational methods, as well as computer performance, now allows for the use of first-principles, or ab initio, calculations based on quantum mechanics for defect-related problems.17–20) Such first-principles studies have provided useful insights toward detailed understanding and elaborate tailoring of lattice defects as well as bulk properties.\nMaterials with diverse properties are needed to further expand the applications of semiconductors, but the number of industrially used semiconducting materials is thus far very limited. With the aid of advanced computational methodologies, in particular those for high-throughput screening using first-principles calculations, previously unreported but promising materials can now be efficiently explored.21,22) These in silico screening approaches have been developing rapidly, so not only the stability and bulk properties of candidate materials but also more complex properties such as those of lattice defects are increasingly considered toward more realistic searches for materials.\nFurthermore, data-science-based schemes can be combined with first-principles calculations to accelerate or enhance screening.

Our discussion covers not only traditional computational approaches to understanding the behavior of currently used and emerging semiconductors but also the design and exploration of as-yet-unreported materials. The remainder of this article is organized as follows:\nIn Sect. 2, we briefly describe the theoretical and computational background of first-principles calculations. We then discuss the prediction of fundamental bulk properties such as band gaps, effective masses, dielectric constants, and optical absorption coefficients in Sect. 3. Also mentioned are point defect properties, including formation energies, local atomistic structures, and electronic states. Among the properties of semiconductor surfaces and interfaces, we focus on the absolute band positions at surfaces and band offsets at heterointerfaces, which constitute a basis for the design of heterostructure devices. In Sect. 4, we discuss the computational design and exploration of as-yet-unreported semiconductors, as well as experimental verification of theoretical predictions. A combination of first-principles calculations and data science techniques, which is currently attracting growing interest, is also mentioned. Finally, concluding remarks are given in Sect. 5.\n2. Theoretical Background Of First-Principles Calculations\nIn this section, we provide a brief overview of basic theory and approximations in first-principles calculations, with an emphasis on those frequently applied to semiconductors. Whereas the solution of Schrödinger equations is originally based on wavefunction theory, density functional theory (DFT)23) is widely employed in recent calculations. In DFT, the fundamental variable is the electron density ρ(r) of all electrons involved in the system, instead of many-body wavefunctions.\nAlthough the existence of the universal total-energy functional E[ ρ] has been proved, the exact functional form is unknown.\nTo determine the ground-state electron density and the corresponding total energy, the Kohn–Sham scheme24) is typically adopted, where the exchange–correlation term expresses the electron–electron interactions other than the Hartree term. The exchange–correlation term is often treated using a density functional that is constructed within the local (spin) density approximation [L(S)DA]24–26) or generalized gradient approximation (GGA),27–29) which are based on solutions for an electron gas. The GGA functionals in particular include various forms, such as Becke 88 (B88),27) Perdew–Wang 91\n(PW91),28) Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE),29) PBEsol,30) and Armiento–Mattsson 05 (AM05).31) When van der Waals interactions play critical roles in the prediction of the geometry, for instance, in layered structures, additional correction terms are applied to model the van der Waals interactions.32–35)\nTypically, the LDA and GGA or these approximations with van der Waals corrections reproduce the lattice parameters of crystals within errors of a few percent.36) However, the band gaps of semiconductors and insulators are severely underestimated, and spatially localized states are not well described. To remedy the latter problem, the LDA and GGA plus the Hubbard U corrections,37,38) that is, LDA+U\nand GGA+U, have been widely employed. Although this approach was originally developed to describe strongly correlated systems, it also improves the band gaps of band insulators when localized states are involved in their valence or conduction bands, as discussed later in Sect. 3.1.1.\nMeta-GGAs such as Tao–Perdew–Staroverov–Scuseria\n(TPSS)39) and the strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) functionals40) have been reported to outperform the LDA and GGA in terms of band-gap prediction, but underestimation is still obvious in many cases. The modified Becke–Johnson (mBJ) exchange potential, in combination with the L(S)DA correlation,41) is often used in current band structure calculations. By appropriately choosing the parameters, the band gaps of various materials can be well reproduced, although the valence and conduction band widths tend to be underestimated.42)\nThe Gritsenko–Leeuwen–Lenthe–Baerends potential including the correlation for solids (GLLB-sc), in which an exchange–correlation derivative discontinuity term is added to the Kohn–Sham gaps,43,44) shows significant improvement in band-gap prediction over the LDA and GGA.44–46) Efficient and improved prediction of band gaps has also been reported using the Δ-sol method, which is a generalization of the Delta self-consistent-field method to infinite solids.47)\nHybrid functionals, in which unscreened or screened nonlocal Fock exchange is partially incorporated, have been shown to describe well the band structures of diverse systems,48–50) as have screened exchange methods.51–53) Both approaches include wavefunctions in the exchange term but can be treated similarly to local and semilocal functionals in the framework of the generalized Kohn–Sham scheme.54)\nVarious forms of hybrid functionals have been proposed to date. Among them, PBE055–57) and Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof\n(HSE06)48,58,59) are often adopted in calculations of solids, including semiconductors. The Becke three-parameter Lee– Yang–Parr functional (B3LYP)60) was originally used for molecules but has also been applied to semiconductors.\nAn issue with hybrid functionals is that the optimal amount of nonlocal exchange is system-dependent, reflecting the strength of the electronic screening,55,61,62) and therefore it must be tuned to reproduce band gaps, especially those of wide-gap materials.62,63) This is empirically possible so that experimental band structures are well reproduced, although recently proposed dielectric-dependent hybrid functionals can provide well-balanced descriptions of a wide variety of systems without empirical tuning.61,64–69) Another issue is that the computational costs are significantly greater than those of LDA and GGA calculations when plane-wave basis functions are used in hybrid functional calculations.\nThe GW approximation70) based on many-body perturbation theory allows for even more accurate prediction of the band gaps of many materials, although the calculations are rather demanding. Several levels of approximation have been proposed in terms of the treatment of the screened Coulomb interaction,71,72) self-consistency,73,74) and vertex corrections in the screened Coulomb interaction72,75) and selfenergy.75,76) In particular, self-energy vertex corrections have been reported to be important for accurate reproduction of the absolute band positions and localized states,76) as discussed later. Although the GW approximation provides quasiparticle energies for dressed electrons and holes on the basis of many060101-2 © \nbody perturbation theory, the total energies can also be obtained in a related manner using the adiabatic-connection fluctuation–dissipation theorem.77)\nA large number of program codes for first-principles calculations have been developed, and many of them cover all or some of these approximations. In particular, fundamental approximations to DFT or hybrid DFT, such as the LDA, GGA, and hybrid functionals, are available in many codes. It has been shown recently that 15 widely used codes yield reproducible results when the same approximation to the exchange–correlation functional in DFT is used, irrespective of differences in the approximations other than the exchange–correlation functional, basis functions, and implementation details.20)\n3. Prediction Of Bulk, Alloy, And Defect Properties Of Semiconductors 3.1 Fundamental Bulk Properties 3.1.1 Band Structure And Band Gaps. Needless To Say,\nthe most fundamental property of semiconductors is the band gap. Except in strongly correlated systems, band gaps are derived from one-electron (single-particle) or quasiparticle band structures. As mentioned in Sect. 2, however, accurate prediction of the band gaps of diverse materials is challenging, as it requires a rather high level of approximation. In addition, spin–orbit coupling reduces band gaps, particularly when heavy elements are the main contributors to electronic states near the gaps. For instance, the reported gap reduction amounts to <0.05 eV for C, Si, GaN, ZnO, GaP, ZnS, and CdS; ∼0.1 eV for Ge, GaAs, ZnSe, and CdSe; and ∼0.3 eV for GaSb, ZnTe, and CdTe; these reductions are attributed mainly to upward shifts of the valence bands.76) The shifts are larger when the main components of the valence bands, which are typically anions in the case of compounds, are heavier. Spin–orbit coupling is safely neglected for some materials composed of light elements but not for others.\nSignificant spin–orbit coupling effects of ∼0.3 and ∼0.7 eV\nhave also been found for PbS and PbTe, respectively, where the electronic states around both the valence band maximum\n(VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) are strongly affected owing to the contributions of Pb(II), as well as Te, in PbTe.78) This is again in contrast to the case of SnS,\nwith lighter Sn(II) and S constituents, which shows a reduction of only 0.02 eV.79) For the organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite CH3NH3PbI3, which has recently attracted tremendous interest as a solar cell photoabsorber material, a gap reduction of as large as ∼1 eV has been reported.80–84)\nThe importance of electron–phonon coupling has also been pointed out, even in predictions of band gaps at the ground state. The reported band gap reduction due to such zero-point renormalization amounts to 0.1 and 0.15 eV in Si85) and ZnO,86) respectively, and it is especially large in diamond, 0.6 eV.87) We need to keep this fact in mind, but theoretical band gaps excluding electron–phonon coupling effects are typically considered in practical first-principles studies of semiconducting materials.\nThe determination of band gaps requires knowledge of the wave-vector dependence of the band energies. This information is obtained by drawing band structure diagrams; note, however, that the band extrema, that is, band edges, are not necessarily located at high-symmetry points sampled in band structure diagrams, and an analysis of the entire first Brillouin zone may be required in some cases.79) Systematic construction of band structure diagrams for materials with diverse crystal structures is actually a hard task, as the band path is crystal-structure-dependent. Fortunately, standard primitive cells and band paths have been reported for all types of crystal structures by Setyawan and Curtarolo88) and by Hinuma et al.,89) and are available online at the AFLOW\nDistributed Materials Property Repository (www.aflowlib.\norg) and the SeeK-path website (www.materialscloud.org/\ntools/seekpath), respectively; in particular, the latter considers band paths that are compatible with crystallographic convention.\norbit coupling included.76,90) Overall, the tendency mentioned in Sect. 2 is recognized: severe underestimation of band gaps by the GGA and improvement by using the hybrid functional and the GW approximation. The GWΓ1 approximation, which includes vertex corrections in the self-energy, yields slightly overestimated band gaps. This is a theoretically reasonable tendency, given that the band gaps are reduced from these values if the electron–phonon coupling effects are also considered.\nThe electronic band structures of In compound semiconductors are shown in Fig. 2.91) Spin–orbit coupling has been taken into account to appropriately describe the valence band structures composed of heavy-hole, light-hole, and split-off bands. On the other hand, many other studies, in which an outline of the band structure is of interest, do not include spin–orbit coupling. For example, band gaps can be reproduced well without considering spin–orbit coupling when the target materials do not consist of heavy elements, as mentioned above.\nAmong the systems included in Fig. 1, the band structure prediction of Zn compounds is challenging owing to the presence of localized Zn 3d states slightly below anion p states. Such localized states are underbound, in other words, too high in energy, under the LDA and GGA, and therefore are over-hybridized with anion states in the valence band.\nThis is an especially serious problem in ZnO, as discussed in previous studies.63,76,92–97) Figure 3 shows the electronic density of states (DOS) of ZnO obtained using the PBE-GGA\nand HSE(a = 0.375) hybrid functionals, the latter of which uses a tuned nonlocal exchange amount of 0.375 to reproduce an experimental band gap.63) Electronic states forming sharp peaks are recognized around −5 and −6.5 eV with respect to the VBM in the PBE-GGA and HSE(a = 0.375) results, respectively. These Zn 3d band positions are too shallow compared to an experimentally reported position of −7.5 eV,98) which results in overhybridization with O 2p states located above them and thereby affects the band gap. The results are enumerated in Table I alongside values from other approximations. PBE-GGA+U can control the 3d position by tuning the effective U value (Ueff), and the experimental 3d position is almost reproduced with Ueff = 7.5 eV. This approach improves the band gap over that of the standard PBE-GGA without +U corrections, but the underestimation is still severe. The GW0@PBE approximation predicts the band gap accurately, although the 3d position is too high owing to the residual self-interaction error.76) This can be 060101-3 © \nimproved by vertex corrections in the self-energy, as in the GWΓ1@HSE06 result, but the calculation becomes much more demanding. The biorthogonal transcorrelated method also yields a reasonably good description of the overall electronic structure of ZnO, as recently reported by Ochi et al.99)\nAnother characteristic band structure is found in SnO,\nwhere the 5s and 5p orbitals of Sn(II) make significant contributions to electronic states near the VBM. Prominent hybridization between the Sn 5sp and O 2p states is recognized in the electronic DOS shown in Fig. 4. Such cationic orbital contributions are favorable for p-type doping as they tend to raise the VBM toward the vacuum level and expand the width of the valence bands,103) as discussed later in Sect. 4.1.\nOrganometal halide perovskites with Pb(II) have analogous band structures. Figure 5 compares the band structures of CH3NH3PbI3 and NH4PbI3 obtained from quasiparticle self-consistent GW and LDA calculations, where the former approach has been confirmed to reproduce well an experimental band gap of CH3NH3PbI3.\n81) The differences between the GW and LDA results are evident in not only the band gap values but also the band dispersions and relative band positions, particularly those of the highest valence bands. The sizable differences, that is, the large band-dependent quasiparticle shifts, are attributed in part to the complicated band structures with the aforementioned Pb(II) orbital contributions; for simpler band structures, the band topologies are typically less affected by quasiparticle shifts, aside from band gap changes. It should again be noted that spin–orbit coupling reduces the band gap of CH3NH3PbI3 by as much as\n∼1 eV.80–84) This value is comparable to the quasiparticle shift of 1.1 eV.81) As a consequence of error cancellation, LDA=GGA calculations neglecting spin–orbit coupling accidentally yield band gaps close to the experimental value.\nBecause many-body approaches such as the GW approximation are computationally rather demanding, a more costeffective but sufficiently accurate approach is required in studies that consider a large number of systems.

For a typical unit cell size, hybrid functional calculations are one or two orders of magnitude more time-consuming than those using the LDA and GGA when a plane-wave basis set is used. A recently proposed non-self-consistent approach is useful for accelerating calculations while retaining sufficient accuracy, at least for semiconductors and insulators with relatively simple band structures.68,106) Another issue with hybrid functionals is that the optimal amount of nonlocal exchange is system-dependent, as discussed in Sect. 2, but this can be resolved nonempirically by the aforementioned dielectric-dependent hybrid functionals; the results for a material set similar to that shown in Fig. 1 have been reported in Ref. 68, and applications to other systems can be found in Refs. 61, 64–67, and 69, all of which demonstrate good performance of dielectricdependent hybrid functionals in band-gap prediction for wide-gap systems.\n3.1.2 Effective masses. The electron and hole effective masses are relevant to most applications of semiconductors, as they are decisive factors affecting the carrier mobilities. Effective masses can be calculated with acceptable accuracy using the LDA and GGA, especially for materials with relatively simple band structures,107) although improved accuracy has reportedly been obtained by using meta-GGA\nor hybrid functionals, for example, for InP and GaAs.108) This is because each of the valence and conduction band structures is reasonably well reproduced even when the band gaps are severely underestimated by the LDA and GGA. Serious errors could occur for systems with localized states around their valence or conduction bands, for example, in the Zn and Cu(I) compounds mentioned above and below. In these 060101-5 © \nmaterials, the position of the localized 3d states affects the valence band structure and thus the effective masses. This problem is often remedied by the use of LDA+U=GGA+U,\nas well as hybrid functionals and the GW approximation.\nA typical procedure for the evaluation of effective masses is the analysis of band curvatures along wave vectors of interest.\nThis can be done on the basis of theoretical band structure diagrams through fine k-point sampling in the vicinity of the band extrema. We again note that, to model the detailed valence band structures, particularly the light-hole and splitoff bands, spin–orbit coupling needs to be taken into account.\nAnother approach includes the computation of so-called DOS effective masses using a theoretical electronic DOS.109) The derivation of average effective mass tensors, which takes into account the effects of nonparabolicity, multiple bands, multiple minima, and anisotropy, has also been reported.110,111) The calculated effective masses for a variety of semiconductors have recently been compiled by Ricci et al.,107) along with other electronic transport properties.\n3.1.3 Dielectric constants. Dielectric constants including both the ionic and electronic contributions are typically calculated using the LDA or GGA on the basis of density functional perturbation theory.112) For evaluation of the electronic contributions, a finite electric field approach113) has also been applied; it can be used in combination with hybrid functionals, as well as the LDA and GGA. The electronic contributions to the dielectric constants are especially sensitive to the quality of the predicted band structures. Table II\nsummarizes the static electronic dielectric constants obtained using the PBE-GGA (with and without +U corrections for the Zn 3d states in the Zn compounds) and PBE0 hybrid functionals. The PBE0 hybrid functional has been reported to well reproduce or slightly overestimate the band gaps of the listed materials. The resultant dielectric constants are close to the experimental values. Here, inclusion of local-field effects is essential; otherwise, the dielectric constants tend to be underestimated. In contrast, the PBE-GGA with local-field effects is prone to overestimate the dielectric constants, mainly because of the underestimation of the band gaps.\nTechnically speaking, theoretical dielectric constants are fortuitously improved by the use of a more approximate approach, that is, the random phase approximation. The +U\ncorrections to the Zn 3d states improve the description of the band structures of Zn compounds, as noted above for ZnO. The resultant dielectric constants are closer to the experimental and PBE0 values.\n3.1.4 Optical properties. Optical absorption and emission are especially important for photovoltaic cell and optoelectronic device applications of semiconductors. Optical absorption spectra can be obtained via calculations of the electronic part of the complex dielectric functions, ideally considering excitonic or electron–hole coupling effects115) and phononassisted electronic transitions, especially for indirect-type semiconductors.116,117) The optical absorption and emission properties have been discussed in many first-principles studies, a notable example of which is the interpretation of the absorption spectrum of In2O3 reported by Walsh et al.118)\nUndoped In2O3 shows an optical absorption onset at about 3.7 eV, which is accompanied by weak absorption with a threshold of about 2.6 eV. This weak absorption degrades the optical transparency slightly and has been attributed\nTable II.

Mean\nabsolute errors (MAEs) with respect to the experimental values are listed on the bottom line; the values in parentheses are obtained using the PBE-GGA results with and without +U corrections for the Zn compounds and the others, respectively.\n1 Experiment\nC 5.5 5.9 5.4 5.7 Si 12.1 12.9 10.9 11.6 BN 4.4 4.6 4.4 4.46\nAlP 7.5 8.1 7.1 7.4 AlAs 8.6 9.3 8.0 8.16\nAlSb 10.7 11.5 9.8 9.88 GaN 5.5 5.8 5.0 5.4\nGaP 9.7 10.4 8.7 8.8\nGaAs 12.9 13.7 10.1 10.86 InP 10.3 11.0 8.7 9.9\nZnO 4.8 (4.1) 5.0 (4.3) 3.6 3.7 ZnS 5.6 (5.3) 5.9 (5.6) 5.1 5.1 ZnSe 6.7 (6.3) 7.2 (6.8) 5.9 5.9 ZnTe 8.3 (7.8) 8.9 (8.4) 7.2 6.9 CdS 5.7 6.1 5.1 5.4\nCdSe 7.2 7.6 5.9 6.2\nCdTe 8.1 8.6 6.9 7.1 MAE 0.7 (0.5) 1.1 (1.0) 0.3\nto either phonon-assisted absorption via an indirect gap or defect-induced absorption, as mentioned in Ref. 118. According to the first-principles calculations by Walsh et al.118)\nand by Fuchs and Bechstedt,119) the highest valence band has a very small wave-vector dependence in In2O3. Therefore, the 1.1 eV difference between the lower weak and higher strong absorption onsets cannot be attributed to the indirect and direct electronic transitions. Instead, Walsh et al. explained this behavior in terms of symmetry- or parity-forbidden electronic transitions from upper valence states to lower conduction states, leading to the strong absorption onset approximately 0.8 eV above the fundamental band gap value118)\n(Fig. 6). This is consistent with their X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results, indicating that the fundamental gap of In2O3 is less than 2.9 eV.\nSn-doped In2O3 allows for simultaneous realization of good optical transparency and high electron conductivity. These properties are exploited in transparent electrodes. In such heavily doped systems, carrier electrons fill the lower part of the conduction band, and the Fermi level is located within the conduction band. This results in a blue shift of the absorption onset, called the Burstein–Moss effect, because only the unoccupied states above the Fermi level contribute to the electronic transition from occupied valence states.\nTheoretical investigation of the Burstein–Moss effects on the optical absorption spectra and optical band gaps has been reported for various semiconductors, including n-type transparent conductive oxides (TCOs) such as In2O3, ZnO, SnO2, and BaSnO3; 120) p-type oxides such as SnO120) and CuAlO2; 120) and heavily dopable nitrides such as GaN,121)\nInN,121) Zn3N2, 122) ScN,123,124) and ZnSnN2.\nAnother example of the use of theoretical optical absorption spectra includes performance evaluation of solar cell photoabsorber materials. Yu and Zunger calculated the photovoltaic energy conversion efficiencies as a function of absorber thickness by extending the Shockley–Queisser model126) and using absorption coefficients obtained from first-principles calculations.127) The effects of nonradiative recombination are approximated in their model. Yu, Zunger, and their coworkers applied this approach to various Cu ternary and Ag ternary chalcogenides,127,128) examples of which are shown in Fig. 7, and ABX half-Heusler compounds;129) their results are also mentioned in Sect. 4.3 on in silico high-throughput screening.\nThe same or analogous approaches have been taken by other researchers to predict the conversion efficiencies of emerging or hypothetical photoabsorber materials, for example, ZnSnP2 and its alloys, compared to industrially used GaAs, CdTe, CuInSe2, and CuGaSe2 by Yokoyama et al.,130)\nCu ternary and Ag ternary chalcogenides by Bercx et al.,131)\nand Ag–Cu sulfides and Pb-free halide double perovskites by Savory et al.132,133) Blank et al. have evaluated the theoretical efficiencies of relevant sulfides and selenides including CuInSe2, CuGaSe2, Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS), Cu2ZnSnSe4\n(CZTSe), CuSbS2, Sb2S3, CuSbSe2, and Sb2Se3 using an\nextended scheme, where the contribution of the refractive\nindex was also taken into account.134)\n3.2 Alloy properties\nAlloying semiconductors is an essential technique for band\ngap engineering. To model alloys of semiconductors as well\nas metals, the cluster expansion method135–137) and Monte\nCarlo simulations are often employed in conjunction with\nfirst-principles calculations, allowing us to construct phase\ndiagrams and predict alloy properties such as compositiondependent band gaps. As an example, the band gaps of\nCuIn1−xGaxSe2 (CIGS) and CuIn1−xAlxSe2 (CIAS) pseudobinary alloys obtained using such a combined approach are\nshown in Fig. 8.138) Ideally random alloys are assumed here,\nwhich have been shown to yield band gaps close to those\nmore rigorously predicted via Monte Carlo simulations in the\ntemperature range of 500–1000 K.138)\nThe band gaps of CIGS and CIAS show not a linear but a\nnearly quadratic composition dependence. This behavior is\ntypical of semiconductor alloys, and their band gaps are often discussed using the band bowing parameter in quadratic\nfitting of the composition dependence of band gaps as\n$\\varepsilon_{\\rm g}(x)=(1-x)\\varepsilon_{\\rm g}^{\\rm A}+xe_{\\rm g}^{\\rm B}-bx(1-x)$  and $\\varepsilon_{\\rm g}^{\\rm B}$ are the band gaps of components A and \nwhere \"Ag and \"Bg are the band gaps of components A and B in 060101-7 © \nan A–B binary or pseudobinary alloy, respectively, and b denotes the bowing parameter.\nTheoretical bowing parameters of 0.16 and 0.57 eV for CIGS and CIAS, respectively, are obtained by fitting the calculated band gaps in the entire composition range.138) It is clear, however, that the composition dependence of CIAS is not quadratic, as it shows stronger bowing at higher CAS contents. Similar behavior has been reported for InGaN alloys.139)\nBecause explicit modeling of alloys is computationally demanding, special quasi-random structures (SQSs)140) are often adopted to mimic random alloys concisely in terms of atomic correlation functions. For CIGS, a bowing parameter of 0.13 eV is obtained using SQSs,130) which is in reasonable agreement with the value from cluster expansion. SQSs can also be used to discuss the properties of compounds with disordered atomic arrangements. Note, however, that random atomic arrangements based on SQSs could be inappropriate for systems that have strong tendencies to preserve specific local environments; examples include ZnSnP2 and ZnSnN2, where disordering of heterovalent Zn and Sn ions is likely to occur under the octet rule or local charge neutrality conservation at typical growth temperature, as reported by Ma et al.141) and by Lany et al.,142) respectively.\nAlloys that consist of isostructural semiconductors having analogous band structures are often considered for band gap engineering, for example, industrially used III–V and II–VI\ncompound semiconductor alloys. Recently, Holder et al. proposed that heterostructural semiconductor alloys can have a wider range of metastable compositions than isostructural alloys, the metastability of which is severely limited by binodal and spinodal decomposition, as shown in Fig. 9.143)\nSuch heterostructural alloys are also of interest in view of their properties; we will return to this issue in Sect. 4.1.\n3.3 Band alignment: Ionization potentials, electron affinities, and heterojunction band offsets Band alignment carries fundamental information for the design of semiconductor heterojunctions.144–146) The ionization potential (IP) and electron affinity (EA), which are the VBM and CBM measured from the vacuum level, respectively, are key parameters often used to discuss band alignment; note that the sign is taken so that the IP and EA are positive when the VBM and CBM are lower than the vacuum level, respectively. The IP and EA involve surface dipole contributions.147–149) Therefore, we should keep in mind that IP- and EA-based band alignment depends on the surface orientation, composition, local atomistic and electronic structure, and adsorption or contamination, which affect the surface dipole. Nevertheless, IPs and EAs from some representative surfaces can be used to predict heterojunction band offsets with reasonable accuracy, especially when the interface constituents have similar crystal and electronic structures.90,150,151) This corresponds to the so-called EA model for the prediction of interfacial conduction band offsets, where charge transfer effects are not taken into account as in the case of the Schottky limit for metal–semiconductor interfaces.146) The EA model has been used directly for the estimation of band offsets at semiconductor heterointerfaces90,152) or modified by charge neutrality levels153) and Schottky pinning parameters accounting for charge transfer effects.146) The Schottky barrier heights at metal–semiconductor interfaces have been predicted in an analogous manner,146,154) where the work functions of metals can also be evaluated through first-principles calculations of surfaces.\nMoreover, surface band alignment is useful for systematic discussion of the doping limits of semiconductors.103)\nOther types of band alignment thus far considered include those using branch point energies or charge neutrality levels,90,146,153) impurity levels such as that of hydrogen,155)\nand averaged interfacial band offsets.90,156,157) In this section, we first discuss surface band alignment and then mention band offsets directly calculated using heterointerface models.\nThe IP (I) and EA (A) are typically obtained by combining the surface and bulk calculations as\n$$I=\\varepsilon_{\\rm vac}^{\\rm surface}-\\varepsilon_{\\rm ref}^{\\rm surface,far}-(\\varepsilon_{\\rm VBM}^{\\rm bulk}-\\varepsilon_{\\rm ref}^{\\rm bulk}),\\tag{2}$$ $$A=\\varepsilon_{\\rm vac}^{\\rm surface}-\\varepsilon_{\\rm ref}^{\\rm surface,far}-(\\varepsilon_{\\rm CBM}^{\\rm bulk}-\\varepsilon_{\\rm ref}^{\\rm bulk}),\\tag{3}$$\n*  The Japan Society of Applied Physics.  \nwhere \"surface vac and \"surface,far ref are the vacuum level and the electrostatic reference level in the bulk-like region far from the surface, respectively. These values can be obtained by a surface calculation using a slab model (supercell), where two-dimensional slab and vacuum regions are stacked in the cell and repeated under three-dimensional periodic boundary conditions. \"bulk VBM, \"bulk CBM, and \"bulk ref are the VBM, CBM, and electrostatic reference level from a bulk calculation, respectively. This procedure is illustrated for IPs in Fig. 10. The macroscopically averaged electrostatic potential is used widely as the reference level,156,158) whereas the local potential at atomic sites is also employed.76,90,159)\nIn principle, the IPs and EAs can be estimated using only surface models, but the bulk-surface combined approach has the following advantages. First, the effects of in-gap surface states are excluded from the estimation of the VBM and CBM. Second, insufficient convergence of the bulk-like region would cause errors in the VBM and CBM when they are evaluated using surface models. This convergence issue is easier to avoid in the combined scheme, as the reference level based on the electrostatic potential converges much faster than the VBM and CBM with respect to the slab thickness. Third, accurate but computationally demanding calculations such as those using the GW approximation are required only for the bulk model if the bulk electrostatic potential is common to the bulk-like region of the surface model treated using the LDA=GGA, that is, if a common electrostatic reference exists.71,76,90,158,160,161) This holds for typical GW\ncalculations performed perturbatively on top of the LDA=\nGGA, but not for self-consistent GW calculations that update the electrostatic potential. To accelerate the calculation, a non-self-consistent hybrid functional approach on top of the LDA=GGA can be used, instead of GW, for the evaluation of the bulk term.68) Alternatively, both the surface and bulk are treated using self-consistent hybrid functional or GW\ncalculations,76,90,162) but the computation, particularly for the surface, becomes much more expensive than that using the LDA=GGA.\nsurfaces obtained using various approximations.76,90) The VBM positions with respect to the vacuum level, that is, the negatives of IPs, from the PBE-GGA calculations are much higher than the experimental values. HSE06 improves the VBM positions, but they are still too high. GW0@PBE and GWTC–TC@HSE06 yield band gaps rather close to the experiment, but the band positions are found to be systematically too low, not only for GaAs and ZnSe, as shown in Fig. 11, but also for other semiconductors.76,90) This is remedied by self-energy vertex corrections, as in the GWΓ1@HSE06 results.\nThe band alignment of various semiconductor surfaces obtained using GWΓ1@HSE06 is shown in Fig. 12.76,90)\nOverall, good agreement is found between theory and experiment, demonstrating the method's predictive power.\nThis approach is, however, computationally rather expensive, and the use of dielectric-dependent hybrid functionals for band alignment is a good compromise in terms of balancing accuracy and efficiency.68)\n![10_image_0.png](10_image_0.png)\nGenerally speaking, modeling of surfaces is a complicated issue because a vast number of possible configurations exist in terms of the surface orientation and atomistic structures.\nRegarding the former point, automatic generation of nonpolar surface models has been reported recently in Refs. 164 and 165; for polar surfaces, modeling must be based on the mechanism that cancels out the internal electric field associated with the polarity, including accumulation of carrier electrons or holes, formation of surface point defects, adsorption, and so on. Moreover, general searches for surface atomistic structures without prior experimental knowledge require global structure optimization techniques.166)\nWhen actual heterointerfaces are formed, specific structural reconstruction at the atomistic and electronic levels takes place, leaving interfacial dipoles. The relative band position of two materials that constitute an interface, that is, the band offset, is affected by such interfacial dipole contributions.144–146,153) Therefore, an explicit model of the heterointerface of interest would be desired. However, it is not straightforward except when two materials that have analogous crystal structures and lattice parameters form coherent interfaces; modeling of semicoherent interfaces, where misfit dislocations exist to relieve strain associated with lattice misfits,167,168) is limited by the affordable number of atoms in the simulation cells, and consideration of incoherent interfaces additionally requires statistical treatment, as these interfaces do not have periodicity. Furthermore, actual interfaces may show other types of atomic reconstruction169) and=or interdiffusion.170) Here we discuss the relatively clear and well-established cases of zinc-blende coherent heterointerfaces with small lattice misfits.\nThe valence band offsets at selected heterointerfaces calculated using various approximations are listed in Table III. The values are those of the so-called natural band offsets, where two interface constituent materials are assumed to be unstrained; the computational procedures adopted for natural band offset evaluation are described in Refs. 90 and 150. In addition, misfit dislocations are not considered in the models; their effects on macroscopic band offsets have been reported to be typically as small as ∼0.1 eV or less for CdTe=CdS, CdS=ZnS, and InP=GaP (110) interfaces with relatively large lattice misfits and therefore high dislocation densities.171) Compared to that of the IPs and EAs, the dependence on the approximation is small. This is attributed in part to the error cancellation between the two constituent materials; for example, the shift in the band positions from the PBE-GGA to GW0@PBE, that is, the quasiparticle shift, is to some extent similar for different materials, as shown for GaAs and ZnSe in Fig. 11. This cancellation does not effectively occur at interfaces between more chemically dissimilar materials. For instance, the difference in the quasiparticle shift between Si and SiO2 at a Si=SiO2 interface is sizable, although the electrostatic potential can be well described at the GGA level.172)\n3.4 Point defects: Native defects, impurities, and dopants 3.4.1 Defect formation energy. Point defects in semiconductors involve various species, charge states, and spin states, resulting in diverse defect-induced material functionalities. The most fundamental quantity associated with these point defects is the energy of defect formation.181–187) With 060101-10 © \nthe configurational entropy, it determines the equilibrium defect concentrations and carrier densities. Furthermore, the thermodynamic transition levels, which correspond to donor, acceptor, or deep-trap levels, are given by the formation energies for different charge states.\nIn materials science, the Gibbs free energy of defect formation, ΔGf, is often used because its fundamental variables, that is, the temperature, pressure, and composition, are relatively easy to control in experiments on solids, compared to the entropy, volume, and chemical potential. To obtain ΔGf theoretically, however, the evaluation of vibrational effects is required, for example, using phonon calculations and the quasi-harmonic approximation.187,188) This is still challenging, especially for charged defects, in terms of both computational complexity and expense. Assuming that the vibrational effects are not significant, at least at relatively low temperature, the total energy change associated with defect formation at 0 K and 0 GPa is typically considered. This quantity is simply called the formation energy, ΔEf, and we use this formulation in the following; the vibrational contributions evaluated separately can be added to ΔEf, if necessary.\nFor a point defect D in charge state q (Dq), the formation energy is given as\n$$\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{f}}[D^{q}]=E[D^{q}]-\\sum_{i}N_{i}\\mu_{i}+q\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{F}},$$\nwhere E[Dq] denotes the total energy of a simulation model\ncontaining defect Dq. Ni and μi are the number and chemical\npotential of a constituent atom of type i, respectively, and εF\nThe atomic chemical potentials are related to the crystal\ngrowth and=or doping conditions. They can vary under the\nconstraints determined by phase equilibria. Taking the case\nof ZnO as an example (i = Zn, O), the relevant constraints are\n$\\mu_{\\rm Zn}+\\mu_{\\rm O}=\\mu_{\\rm Zn}({\\rm bulk})$,  $\\mu_{\\rm Zn}\\leq\\mu_{\\rm Zn}({\\rm metal})$,  $\\mu_{\\rm O}\\leq\\frac{1}{2}\\mu_{\\rm O_{2}}({\\rm molecule})$,  $\\mu_{\\rm Zn}({\\rm metal})$ and $\\mu_{\\rm O_{2}}({\\rm molecule})$ denote the charge \nwhere μZnO(bulk), μZn(metal), and O2ðmoleculeÞ denote the chemical potentials of bulk ZnO, Zn metal, and the O2 molecule,\nrespectively. The calculated total energies of each phase are\ntypically used for these values, although more elaborate\nmodels consider the Gibbs free energies at a given temperature and pressure.\nThe upper limit of μZn, in other words, the lower limit of\nμO, corresponds to the Zn-rich (O-poor) limit, which is\nThe other limit, that is, the O-rich (Zn-poor) limit, is given as\n$\\mu_{\\rm Zn}=\\mu_{\\rm Zn}({\\rm metal})$,  $\\mu_{\\rm O}=\\mu_{\\rm ZnO}({\\rm bulk})-\\mu_{\\rm Zn}({\\rm metal})$.  that is the O-rich (Zn-norm) limit is given \n$$\\mu_{\\rm Zn}=\\mu_{\\rm ZnO}({\\rm bulk})-\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\mu_{\\rm O_{2}}({\\rm molecule}),\\tag{7}$$ $$\\mu_{\\rm O}=\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\mu_{\\rm O_{2}}({\\rm molecule}).$$  In addition to the $\\mu_{\\rm O_{2}}$-molecule, the $\\mu_{\\rm O_{2}}$-molecule is $\\mu_{\\rm O_{2}}$-molecule.  \nNote that these limiting conditions for the chemical potentials\nmay be determined by other compounds when they are\npresent. For instance, the O-rich limit in SnO is given as the\n![11_image_0.png](11_image_0.png)\n$$({\\boldsymbol{\\H}})$$\n$$\\Delta\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{F}}=\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{F}}-\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{VBM}}.$$\n$$({\\boldsymbol{\\delta}})$$\nequilibrium with bulk SnO2 rather than the O2 molecule.\nThese cation-rich (O-poor) and O-rich (cation-poor) limits\nare often considered as representatives of low and high O2\npartial pressure conditions, respectively; if necessary, the O2\npartial pressure dependence can be explicitly discussed via\nthermodynamic modeling of the O2 gas phase, as described\nlater in Sect. 3.4.3. In ternary systems, several competing\nphases may be present, including elementary substances,\nbinary compounds, and ternary compounds other than the target material. The limiting conditions for the chemical potentials are readily determined using chemical potential\ndiagrams, as reported, for example, in Refs. 159, 189, and\n190. Systems with more components can be treated similarly.\nExcept for degenerate semiconductors where the Fermi\nlevel is located within the valence or conduction band, εF is\ntypically assumed to vary between the VBM and CBM. The\nFermi level is often measured with respect to the VBM level\n-\"F ¼ \"F - \"VBM: ð8Þ\nThen the variable range of $\\Delta\\varepsilon_{\\rm F}$ becomes  $$0\\leq\\Delta\\varepsilon_{\\rm F}\\leq\\varepsilon_{\\rm g}.$$\nWhen some crystal growth conditions or chemical potential\nvalues are assumed, the formation energies are thus described\nas a function of ΔεF. Although the formation energies of\nneutral defects do not depend on ΔεF, those of charged defects\nshow specific dependences. Here, the positive and negative\ncharge states (q > 0 and q < 0) indicate donor and acceptor\nbehavior of defects, respectively, and these defects are\nassociated with carrier generation and compensation.\nDiagrams showing the formation energy versus the Fermi\nlevel are often used for general discussion. This is illustrated\nin Fig. 13, taking as an example the O vacancy in ZnO at the\nZn-rich (O-poor) limit given by Eq. (6). It is found that the 2+ charge state is energetically most favorable at low Fermi\nlevel positions, whereas the neutral charge state is energetically most favorable at high Fermi level positions, as in n-type ZnO. The + charge state is never stable. This behavior is often denoted as negative U and is also found for point defects in other materials.\n3.4.2 Thermodynamic transition level and optical transition energy. The thermodynamic transition levels of point defects are often simply called defect levels and are further categorized into donor, acceptor, and deep-trap levels in discussions of semiconductors. These thermodynamic levels involve atomic relaxation effects and therefore are different from the optical transition energies described below.\nBy definition, the thermodynamic transition level corresponds to the Fermi level at which the formation energies of a defect in two charge states, q and qA, are equal.181–183,191)\nWhen measured from the VBM, it is given as\n$$\\varepsilon(q/q^{\\prime})=\\frac{\\Delta E_{\\rm f}[D^{q},\\Delta\\varepsilon_{\\rm F}=0]-\\Delta E_{\\rm f}[D^{q^{\\prime}},\\Delta\\varepsilon_{\\rm F}=0]}{q^{\\prime}-q},\\tag{10}$$\nwhere -Ef½Dq; -\"F ¼ 0 denotes the formation energy of defect Dq for ΔεF = 0. In Fig. 13, the thermodynamic transition level of the O vacancy in ZnO is given as an example; other examples are also given later in Sect. 3.4.6.\nThe optical (vertical) transition energies associated with the absorption and emission of photons can be obtained using the Franck–Condon principle.182,187) Typically, it is evaluated similarly to the thermodynamic transition level but with the atomic coordinates frozen at those of the initial state.\nAlternatively, single-particle or quasiparticle energies can be used to estimate the optical transition energies using the atomic geometries in the initial state. Note that these schemes neglect the effects of electron–hole interactions on the electronic transition, that is, excitonic effects, which are sizable when localized defect states are involved. For instance, a GW\nand Bethe–Salpeter study has shown that excitonic effects lead to a ∼0.2 eV red shift for the C vacancy in SiC.192) Such an approach including excitonic effects is ideal but rather computationally demanding when applied to point defects in supercells.\n3.4.3 Equilibrium Fermi level position, defect concentration, and carrier density. Once the formation energies of the relevant defects are obtained, the equilibrium Fermi level at a given temperature is derived simultaneously with the equilibrium charged defect concentrations and carrier densities via the charge neutrality condition.105,182,187,189,191,193,194) If the vibrational entropy contribution to ΔGf and the pressure effect are negligibly small, the concentration of dilute defect Dq is given using ΔEf[Dq] as\n$$C[D^{q}]=N[D^{q}]\\exp\\biggl(-\\frac{\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{f}}[D^{q}]}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}\\biggr),$$\nwhere N[Dq] is the number of sites per unit volume for defect Dq times its spin degeneracy, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute temperature. The hole density in the valence band (p) and the electron density in the conduction band (n) are given as\n$$\\begin{array}{l}{{p=\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{{VBM}}}}D(\\varepsilon)\\frac{1}{\\exp[(\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{{F}}}-\\varepsilon)/k_{\\mathrm{{B}}}T]+1}\\;d\\varepsilon,}}\\\\ {{n=\\int_{\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{{GBM}}}}^{\\infty}D(\\varepsilon)\\frac{1}{\\exp[(\\varepsilon-\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{{F}}})/k_{\\mathrm{{B}}}T]+1}\\;d\\varepsilon,}}\\end{array}$$\nwhere D(ε) is the electronic DOS for the perfect crystal, assuming that the presence of dilute defects does not essentially affect the DOS. The defect concentrations and carrier densities are constrained by the charge neutrality condition as p - n þXqC½Dq ¼ 0: ð14Þ\nUnder given chemical potential conditions, the concentrations of neutral defects at T are determined only by Eq. (11). Self-consistent solutions to Eqs. (11)–(14) provide the concentrations of charged defects, the densities of carrier electrons and holes, and the Fermi level under thermal equilibrium. It should be noted that the thermodynamic transition levels, that is, the donor, acceptor, and deep-trap levels, are irrelevant to the resultant defect concentrations and carrier densities.\nIn real materials, point defects introduced during crystal growth or doping at elevated temperature are somewhat or strongly quenched to room temperature. These situations can also be simulated under the assumption that the defect concentrations are frozen at the temperature before quenching, and electrons and holes are redistributed between the defect levels and host bands.189,191,194) The thermodynamic transition levels now play crucial roles, as some of redistributed carriers are trapped there. From another viewpoint, carriers are thermally excited from the donor and acceptor levels in this situation; this scenario is often considered in the discussion of real semiconducting materials.\nThe gas partial pressure dependence of the defect concentrations and carrier densities is often of interest, in addition to the temperature dependence. In this case, the temperature and partial pressure dependence of the chemical potentials of the gas phases is taken into account using the ideal gas model;182,195) for high-pressure conditions, the fugacity should be used instead of the partial pressure.190,196) A more rigorous approach also considers the vibrational contributions of solid phases via phonon calculations or molecular dynamics simulations.187,188)\n3.4.4 Supercell approach to point defects. In practical first-principles calculations of point defects, the supercell approach is often adopted. A point defect is placed in a supercell, which is constructed by expanding a primitive or conventional unit cell so that the bulk-like region far from the defect is sufficiently large. The number of atoms in the resulting supercells is typically 50 to a few hundred, or sometimes even larger, depending on the characteristics of the host materials and defects as well as the balance between the required accuracy and affordable computational costs.\nAs in calculations for perfect crystals based on band theory, the supercell, and therefore a point defect therein, is repeated under three-dimensional periodic boundary conditions. To model defects at the dilute limit, corrections are needed to eliminate spurious interactions, particularly electrostatic interactions between a charged defect, its periodic images, and a charge-compensating jellium background, that is, image-charge interactions.197,198)\nOn the basis of Eqs. (4) and (8), the defect formation energy is obtained using the supercell approach as\n$$\\Delta E_{\\rm f}[D^{q}]=E[D^{q}]+E_{\\rm c}[D^{q}]-E_{\\rm p}$$ $$-\\sum_{i}\\Delta N_{i}\\mu_{i}+q(\\varepsilon_{\\rm VBM}+\\Delta\\varepsilon_{\\rm F}),\\tag{15}$$\n*  The Japan Society of Applied Physics.  \n(12)  $\\binom{13}{2}$  (13)  ... \nwhere E[Dq] and Ep are the total energy of the supercell containing defect Dq and that of the perfect-crystal supercell, respectively. ΔNi is the difference in the number of an atom of type i between these supercells. For instance, ΔNZn = 0 and ΔNO = −1 for the O vacancy, and ΔNZn = 1 and ΔNO = 0 for the Zn interstitial in ZnO.\nThe correction term Ec[Dq] is required for charged defects to eliminate the energy contribution of the image-charge interactions.187,199,200) This issue has been extensively discussed, and several correction schemes have been proposed.197–205) Among them, we prefer the scheme proposed by Freysoldt et al. because of its theoretical elegance and generality. Additionally, we have extended their scheme so that the corrections are effective for anisotropic systems such as layered structures206) and the atomic geometries after relaxation, which allows for application of the correction scheme to diverse three-dimensional systems;200) correction schemes for one- and two-dimensional systems have also been developed recently by several researchers.207–210)\nHistorically, potential alignment corrections have been applied to εVBM,\n182) but it has been proved recently that potential alignment is unnecessary if the image-charge correction is properly applied.200)\nOther necessary corrections include those associated with band-filling effects.182,183,191) When defects induce shallow acceptor (donor) states with host valence (conduction) band characteristics, which are called perturbed host or hydrogenic effective-mass states, the valence (conduction) bands are filled by holes (electrons) in finite-sized supercells. If heavily doped systems are of interest, such models with high carrier densities may be used to discuss the Burstein–Moss effects\n(see Sect. 3.1.4), keeping in mind that defects are regularly repeated in the supercells, in contrast to real materials.\nOtherwise, corrections to the band-filling effects are required for predicting the defect formation energies at the dilute limit.\nIt should be noted that defects with perturbed host states do not behave as expected from the assumed charge states, because the defect-induced holes or electrons spread over supercells. For example, shallow donor defects of this type in the neutral charge state are essentially identical to those in positive charge states. Therefore, special treatments are required for the evaluation or correction of the formation energies of defects with perturbed host states.63,189) Moreover, determination of the shallow defect levels associated with hydrogenic states is challenging, as these states could extend to several unit cells, that is, far beyond the supercell size conventionally used. Zhang et al. have reported a computational approach to tackle this issue, which combines the GW calculation for the central-cell potential with a potential patching method for large systems containing 64,000 atoms to describe the wavefunctions of hydrogenic defect states.211)\nThey demonstrated good reproduction of experimental values of acceptor levels in Si and GaAs.\nDefect formation energies and thermodynamic transition levels are thus discussed on the basis of the total energies from supercell calculations including appropriate finite-cellsize corrections. Hydrogenic shallow states are, however, difficult to treat using conventional supercells and are often discussed only qualitatively. The one-electron (single-particle) or quasiparticle energies of defect supercells, as well as their total energies, can be used to estimate the optical transition energies, where the atomic coordinates are frozen upon the electronic transition; ideally, excitonic effects are considered here, as mentioned in Sect. 3.4.2. Such single-particle or quasiparticle energies are also useful for qualitative understanding of defect states, as illustrated in the following section; note that image-charge corrections are needed for single-particle and quasiparticle levels associated with charged defects, as well as the total energies of their supercells.205,212–214) Supercell approaches to point defects and related issues are also described elsewhere, for example, in Refs. 97, 181–183, and 185–187.\n3.4.5 Approximation to exchange–correlation interaction. The accuracy of the calculated total energies is central to reliable prediction of the defect formation energies and thermodynamic transition levels, where an appropriate choice of the approximation to the exchange–correlation interaction is most important. Further, as the formation energies of charged defects depend on the Fermi level, accurate prediction of the VBM and CBM, which serve as the references for the Fermi level, is essential as well. These band edge positions are also highly dependent on the approximation, as discussed in Sects. 3.1.1 and 3.3.\nAs an approach satisfying both requirements sufficiently, hybrid functionals are widely employed in recent theoretical investigations into point defects in semiconductors, although the calculations are much more expensive than those using the LDA(+U) and GGA(+U). To accelerate the calculations, a combination of the LDA(+U)=GGA(+U) total energies with band edge determination using hybrid functionals or the GW\napproximation has been considered.62,79,215) This approach is justified by the reasonable correspondence between the defect levels from LDA(+U)=GGA(+U) and hybrid functional calculations when the band edges are corrected, as demonstrated for defects in SiC, AlN, GaN, Cu3N, Zn3N2, and ZnO.214–217) Note, however, that the LDA(+U)=GGA(+U)\ncannot well describe the polaronic electron and hole localization associated with point defect formation, except when the +U corrections can be directly applied to these polaronic states. Such localization is typically coupled with particular atomic relaxations, potentially leading to large energy errors when the localized states are not appropriately described.\nTo remedy this, a scheme relevant to the +U approach has been suggested by Lany and Zunger in which corrections are applied so that defect states meet a generalized Koopmans condition, that is, independence of defect-induced energy levels from the electron occupation number.218)\nAnother combined approach has been applied in studies of the self-interstitial in Si by Rinke et al.219) and the O vacancy in HfO2 by Choi and Chang,220) where the vertical transition energy contributions to the defect formation energies are estimated using the GW approximation, and the other contributions are evaluated using the LDA (or other approximations such as the GGA). Jain et al. later used a similar approach to investigate the O vacancy in HfO2, additionally including electrostatic corrections.213) Many-body methods for total energy evaluation have also been applied to point defects in semiconductors, such as random phase approximation of the correlation energy221) and quantum Monte Carlo methods.222–225) These results are important as benchmarks, although the calculations are demanding.\n3.4.6 Applications of point defect calculations to defect-related issues in semiconductors. Many first-principles studies of point defects have been reported for semiconducting materials thus far, revealing the behavior of defects at the atomistic and electronic levels as well as the defect energetics. Some examples of such studies are reviewed here.\nEnergetics and electronic levels of native defects and impurities in ZnO. It is well recognized that ZnO is a representative oxide semiconductor with a wide variety of applications. The fundamental characteristics of its native defects and residual impurities have been investigated both experimentally and theoretically to reveal the origins of observed properties such as the off-stoichiometry with Zn excess (O deficiency), n-type conductivity, optical absorption and emission, and so forth, as reviewed, for example, in Refs. 97 and 226–232. Either the O vacancy or Zn interstitial is often assumed to be a dominant native defect species and is associated with the off-stoichiometry and n-type conductivity. However, such assumptions are controversial, and this issue has been addressed using first-principles calculations. In early studies,193,233–241) the calculations were carried out using the LDA, GGA, LDA+U, or GGA+U,\nwhich resulted in severe band gap underestimation, as mentioned in Sect. 3.1.1. Discussion of the defect formation energies and electronic levels was therefore challenging, even though several types of post-calculation corrections were suggested.193,234,238,239) Later hybrid functional studies, which reproduced the band gap well, yielded different results even qualitatively for some characteristics.63,242–249)\nAs an example, Fig. 14 shows the formation energies and thermodynamic transition levels of native defects in ZnO from HSE(a = 0.375) hybrid functional calculations.97) The dependence of the formation energies on the chemical potential conditions, which vary between the Zn-rich (O-poor) and O-rich (Zn-poor) limits in Eqs. (6) and (7), respectively, is understandable from the definition given by Eqs. (4) and (15).\nFor instance, the formation energies of defects associated with O deficiency or Zn excess, that is, the O vacancy, Zn interstitial, and Zn antisite, are lowest, whereas those associated with Zn deficiency or O excess, that is, the Zn vacancy, O interstitial, and O antisite, are highest at the Zn-rich (O-poor) limit [Fig. 14(a)], and vice versa at the O-rich (Zn-poor) limit [Fig. 14(b)]; note that the O interstitial and antisite are not included in Fig. 14 because of their relatively high formation energies. In other words, the O\nvacancy, Zn interstitial, and Zn antisite are relatively easily formed under low O2 partial pressure, whereas the Zn vacancy, O interstitial, and O antisite are easily formed under high partial pressure. Another important observation from Figs. 14(a) and 14(b) is the donor or acceptor behavior of each type of defect; positive and negative gradients, that is, charge states, indicate donors and acceptors, respectively. Finally, the defect levels are visible in Figs. 14(a) and 14(b), and are also shown in Fig. 14(c) in the form of an energy level diagram.\nThe primary conclusions on native donor-type defects from the theoretical defect energetics are as follows: the O vacancy shows a low formation energy and a rather deep ε(2+=0) donor level owing to the negative U behavior, as mentioned in Sect. 3.4.1, and the Zn interstitial and Zn antisite have high formation energies, although they are shallow donors. The observed nonstoichiometry is under-\n![14_image_0.png](14_image_0.png)\nstandable from the easy formation of the O vacancy, whereas the n-type conductivity is explained by neither the O vacancy nor the Zn interstitial.\nThe characteristics of the O vacancy and Zn interstitial can also be determined from their one-electron structures and local atomistic structures, which are shown in Fig. 15. The neutral O vacancy gives rise to a localized one-electron state deep in the band gap and causes inward relaxation of adjacent Zn ions by as much as 10%. The 2+ charge state behaves differently, inducing no localized in-gap state and weak perturbation of the lowest conduction band. The neighboring Zn ions show outward relaxation by 23%. Similarly, the neutral Zn interstitial perturbs the lowest conduction band only slightly.\nExcept for the electron occupancy, the band structures are essentially the same for the + and 2+ charge states.63) These features in the one-electron structure are typical of shallow donors with hydrogenic, perturbed host states. Note again that as mentioned in Sect. 3.4.2, the one-electron defect levels do not correspond to the thermodynamic transition levels determined by the formation energies of the two relevant charge 060101-14 © \n![15_image_0.png](15_image_0.png)\nstates in their own equilibrium geometries. Nevertheless, the depth of the defect levels can be qualitatively understood in terms of the one-electron structures, as illustrated here by the cases of the O vacancy and Zn interstitial in ZnO.\nVan de Walle and Janotti proposed that H impurities unintentionally incorporated into an interstitial (bond-center)\nsite and the substitutional O site are both shallow donors in ZnO on the basis of their LDA and LDA+U calculations.250,251) The shallow donor behavior of the H impurities is reproduced by HSE(a = 0.375) hybrid functional calculations, as shown in Fig. 14(c). Other proposed sources of shallow donors in ZnO include a complex of a Zn interstitial and N impurity252) and the Zn interstitial when it is stabilized in the presence of a high concentration of O vacancies owing to strong attractive interactions.253) Metastable shallow donor behavior of the O vacancy238) and the (2H–VZn) complex247)\nhas also been reported to elucidate the persistent photoconductivity observed in ZnO.\nThe Zn vacancy has been considered the dominant acceptor-type defect in ZnO. As shown in Fig. 14, it generates deep acceptor levels. The formation energy is generally high and positive even for the Fermi level position at the CBM, especially under the Zn-rich condition. Therefore, the Zn vacancy does not significantly compensate for carrier electrons, except when the Fermi level lies inside the conduction band, as in heavily doped ZnO in transparent electrode applications. Recently, a polaronic hole trap around the Zn vacancy has been proposed by Petretto and Bruneval246) and Frodason et al.,248) but it is not considered in the results presented in Fig. 14. Up to four holes are localized at the O ions adjacent to the Zn vacancy, which is accompanied by distinct outward, off-symmetric relaxation of the O ions, as shown in Fig. 16.248) Because of the polaronic trap, the formation energy of the neutral Zn vacancy becomes\n![15_image_1.png](15_image_1.png)\nlower than that shown in Fig. 14, and the + and 2+ charge states appear at low Fermi level positions.\np-type doping of ZnO is known to be rather challenging.\nBoth experimental and theoretical efforts have been made to overcome the difficulty, as reviewed by Avrutin et al. in Ref. 230. Reported first-principles studies suggest the following fundamental reasons: First, a strong energetic preference for donor-type native defects leads to compensation for doped holes, as discussed above. Rather high or even nonequilibrium O-rich growth conditions are required to suppress the formation of such defects. Further, residual donor impurities such as H and Al should be eliminated. Second, isolated dopants that act as shallow acceptors are unavailable, according to recent systematic calculations by Yim et al.249) Impurity doping in a defect complex form may be a possible route to resolving this issue.230,254)\nNative defects and doping in tin sulfides. The tin sulfides SnS, Sn2S3, and SnS2 are attracting growing interest. The best studied among the three phases is presumably SnS with Sn(II), which has been considered for use in solar cell absorber applications in recent decades.255–257) SnS2 with Sn(IV) takes a characteristic layered structure and has been examined for use as, for instance, an electrode in Li ion batteries258) and a visible-light photocatalyst for water splitting.259) Sn2S3 is a well-established mixed-valence tin binary compound that inherits the structural and electronic features of both Sn(II) and Sn(IV). Typically, undoped SnS\nexhibits p-type conductivity,255–257) whereas Sn2S3 and SnS2 are n-type conductors.260) To understand this carrier polarity, their native defects have been investigated using firstprinciples calculations; a doping strategy toward inversion of the carrier type has also been proposed.79,255,257,261)\nAs an example of such studies, Fig. 17 shows the theoretical formation energies of native defects in SnS, Sn2S3, and SnS2 reported by Kumagai et al.79) For all the phases, the overall defect energetics are consistent with the aforementioned carrier types. The specific behavior of native defects in each phase is now presented.\n![16_image_0.png](16_image_0.png) \nIn SnS, the Sn vacancy is a dominant defect at most Fermi level positions under the Sn-poor condition, as shown in Fig. 17(a). It gives rise to a hydrogenic shallow acceptor state located almost at the VBM, although such hydrogenic states are not included in the figure owing to the difficulty of treating them by the conventional supercell approach, as discussed in Sect. 3.4.4. This implies that SnS prepared under such conditions should exhibit p-type behavior, although some carrier compensation by the donor-type S vacancy is expected at low Fermi level positions. Under the Sn-rich condition, the formation energy of the Sn vacancy is not extremely low even when the Fermi level is located near the CBM, indicating a good chance for conversion into the n-type by the use of donor impurities. Indeed, the fabrication of n-type SnS by Cl doping was reported recently by Yanagi et al.262) According to a combined experimental and theoretical study by Ran et al., n-type doping of SnS is also possible via alloying with PbS.257) The role of alloying has been explained in terms of the expansion of the interstitial sites, which facilitates the formation of donor-type Sn and Pb interstitials.\nMoving on to Sn2S3 [Fig. 17(b)], the donor-type Sn interstitial exhibits a low formation energy, as expected from its relatively large open space at the interstitial site. The formation energy of the Sn interstitial is negative at Fermi 060101-16 © \n![17_image_0.png](17_image_0.png)\nlevel positions below ∼0.2 eV, where spontaneous hole compensation takes place. Nonetheless, p-type conversion could be obtained using an acceptor dopant because the lower limit of the Fermi level at ∼0.2 eV is close to the VBM. On the basis of systematic calculations of candidate acceptor dopants, K is proposed to be an effective acceptor.79) The K\ndopant is preferentially located at the Sn(II) site in Sn2S3, rather than at the interstitial site, because its ionic radius is sufficiently large. This is an important consequence because interstitial K dopants act as donors.\nFour types of donor-type defects are easily formed in SnS2, as shown in Fig. 17(c). Among them, the Sn interstitial has the lowest formation energy under most chemical potential and Fermi level conditions. This behavior can be attributed to the large interlayer space in the crystal structure of SnS2.\nAlthough the Sn interstitial is a donor-type defect, it exhibits somewhat deep levels below the CBM. Therefore, a high carrier density is not expected in the absence of intentional or unintentional impurities.\nThese features of native defects specific to the three tin sulfide phases are systematically understood in terms of the valence of Sn in each phase and the resultant crystal and band structures.79)\nNative defects in organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite CH3NH3PbI3. The organometal halide perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 is currently a major target of research on highly efficient and low-cost solar cell applications.263) Yin et al. systematically investigated the formation energies and electronic levels of native point defects in CH3NH3PbI3 using first-principles calculations.264) The reported theoretical defect levels are shown in Fig. 18. They found that the dominant native defects are the Pb vacancy and the CH3NH3 þ interstitial under most chemical potential conditions, and these defects act as a shallow acceptor and a shallow donor, respectively. Not only the Pb vacancy and the CH3NH3 þ interstitial but also other defects with low formation energies do not generate deep in-gap levels, which is advantageous for minimizing carrier recombination in the photoabsorber. These defect properties can be understood in terms of the electronic structure characteristic of hybridization of Pb 6s and I 5p,264) as discussed in Sects. 3.1.1 and 4.1.\nNative defect concentrations and carrier densities in SnO.\nUsing the calculated DOS and defect formation energies, the\n![17_image_1.png](17_image_1.png)\nConcentration (cm-3)\ndefect concentrations and carrier densities are evaluated as described in Sect. 3.4.3. Figure 19 shows the calculated equilibrium native defect concentrations and carrier densities in SnO,105) which are obtained at the O-rich limit by considering the equilibrium between SnO and SnO2, as mentioned in Sect. 3.4.1. Among the native defects considered, the Sn vacancy in the 2− charge state has a much higher concentration than the others. Because of its acceptor nature, the hole density has the same order as the Sn vacancy concentration, indicating p-type behavior of SnO. This result is consistent with the p-type conductivity observed in undoped SnO.104,265,266)\nCoupling of point defect states with local atomistic structures: DX centers and vacancies. Localized defectinduced states are often accompanied by specific local atomic relaxations, as discussed in Sect. 3.4.5. The best-known example of such strong defect state-atomistic structure coupling is probably the DX center in AlxGa1−xAs alloys.267) According to first-principles calculations by Chadi and Chang, a substitutional Si dopant is substantially displaced toward an 060101-17 © \n![18_image_1.png](18_image_1.png)\ninterstitial site.268) This results in the formation of deep in-gap donor states, as opposed to the shallow donor behavior of conventional substitutional dopants. Lany and Zunger have theoretically proposed the presence of intrinsic DX centers in chalcopyrite CuInSe2 and CuGaSe2, where the neutral In and Ga antisite defects displaced from the Cu site act as DX\ncenters.269) This is illustrated for CuGaSe2 in Fig. 20. The deep donor nature of the intrinsic DX center in CuGaSe2 could make it difficult to maintain high efficiencies in CIGS solar cells when the Ga content is increased.269) Kumagai et al. later reported that the neutral Sn-on-Zn antisite in chalcopyrite ZnSnP2 likewise becomes an intrinsic DX center.189)\nAnalogous behavior of Ti antisite defects in perovskite SrTiO3 has been reported by Choi et al. on the basis of their calculations.270) As shown in Fig. 21, the Ti antisite at the Sr site is displaced in either the  or  direction, resulting in two types of off-centered configurations. These off-centered Ti antisites have several interesting features, such as low formation energies comparable to that of the O\nvacancy under Ti-rich conditions, the generation of local dipole moments resulting from the off-centering, switching of the directions of the off-centering and dipole moments with a low activation energy of ∼0.2 eV, and deep donor levels associated with the localization of Ti 3d electrons. The experimentally observed ferroelectricity in nonstoichiometric SrTiO3 films271,272) can be explained by the formation of such antisite defects.270,273)\nAnother example of strong defect state-atomistic structure coupling is polaronic hole trapping by the Zn vacancy in ZnO, where a distinct off-symmetric relaxation of the holetrapping O ions occurs, as shown in Fig. 16. A polaronic trap of electrons and a concurrent atomic displacement have also been reported for the O vacancy in SrTiO3, 274)\nwhereas related metastable vacancy configurations have been found in other perovskites such as BaTiO3, KTaO3, and NaTaO3.\n275,276) Another type of characteristic electronic and atomic configuration of the O vacancy in SrTiO3 has been proposed by Choi et al., in which the O vacancy is accompanied by local TiO6 octahedral rotation even in the cubic perovskite phase, which is otherwise free from octahedral rotation.277) In addition, the formation of O vacancy clusters\n![18_image_0.png](18_image_0.png)\nin SrTiO3 has been reported both experimentally278) and theoretically.279) The relevance of these isolated O vacancies and clusters to the observed n-type conductivity280) and optical properties, particularly blue light emission from reduced SrTiO3, 281) has been discussed on the basis of the results of first-principles calculations.\nDefect complexes. The atomistic and electronic structure of defect complexes in semiconductors, as well as their binding or association energies, has been investigated using first-principles calculations. Complexes may consist only of native defects or involve residual impurities or dopants. O\nvacancy clusters in SrTiO3 are an example of the former.279)\nThe DX center and its related defects may also be regarded as complexes, each of which is composed of an interstitial atom displaced from a host atomic site and a vacancy, as demonstrated in Fig. 20.\nAs an example of a case where dopants are involved, Fig. 22(a) shows the structure of a complex consisting of a Ce dopant and four B vacancies in cubic BN predicted using first-principles calculations.282) The Ce dopant is unlikely to be located at the cationic B site in BN owing to the huge size mismatch. Indeed, first-principles calculations predicted an extremely high formation energy for this simple substitution.\nAs a result of systematic calculations for diverse complex configurations, the structure shown in Fig. 22(a) was iden060101-18 © \n![19_image_0.png](19_image_0.png)\ntified as energetically favorable. The Ce dopant is located at the anionic N site, rather than the cationic B site, and is accompanied by four vacancies at the adjacent B sites, so the huge size mismatch is accommodated. This theoretical prediction has been experimentally supported using scanning transmission electron microscopy [Figs. 22(c) and 22(d)]\nand electron energy loss spectroscopy, which identified Ce dopants only on the N atomic columns. The behavior is significantly different for a high-pressure synthesized Cedoped wurtzite AlN phosphor, where the Ce dopants are located at the substitutional Al sites.283)\nHydrogen impurities. The roles of H impurities in semiconductors have attracted great interest recently. Investigation into H impurities is especially important for oxide semiconductors, understanding of which is limited compared to that of, for instance, Si and GaN. Although it has been difficult to detect a low concentration of H impurities experimentally, recent efforts have enabled the improvement of the detection limit down to ∼1 × 1016 cm−3.\n284) H impurities in oxide semiconductors often act as donors to generate carrier electrons or to hinder p-type doping by hole compensation, as illustrated by the aforementioned case of ZnO. These roles of H impurities have also been discussed for other oxide semiconductors on the basis of first-principles calculations.\nJanotti and Van de Walle theoretically proposed the abundance and shallow donor behavior of H impurities at host O sites, where the H impurities form multicenter bonds with adjacent cations.251) This has provided better understanding of the important roles of H impurities, in addition to typical interstitial-like H ions that are bonded to host O ions in OH−-\nlike configurations.\nStrategies for carrier doping and carrier-mediated ferromagnetism. Carrier doping is extremely difficult for some materials, particularly those having exceedingly wide band gaps. Other materials are readily dopable into either p- or n-type semiconductors, but inversion of the carrier type could be challenging, as in the case of ZnO. First-principles studies have been used to investigate these issues and propose possible doping strategies for various systems. Such insights are especially useful for emerging or hypothetical materials with unknown dopability. A typical approach is the search for effective dopants by investigating the formation energies and electronic levels of candidate elements at various sites. Additionally, carrier compensation by native defects and unintentional impurities, as well as incorporation of the dopants themselves into unexpected sites, should be examined. Such theoretical studies have been conducted, for instance, to discuss n-type doping of SnS79,257,261) and p-type doping of Sn2S3, 79) as mentioned above, and to assess the dopability of emerging materials such as cubic Si3N4 and Ge3N4.\n285,286) Investigation into defect properties is also useful for in silico screening of candidate materials such as p-type TCOs,110) 18-valence-electron compounds,287,288) and ternary nitrides,190) as detailed later in Sect. 4.3. When the crystals have large open spaces, as in layered structures, doping into interstitial or interlayer sites could be effective, as proposed for hexagonal BN.289)\nFurthermore, doped carriers could be localized as polarons, which would substantially degrade the carrier mobilities. The assessment of such polaron formation is especially important for conventional oxide semiconductors, where relatively localized O 2p states at the VBM could facilitate the formation of hole polarons, as systematically investigated by Varley et al.290)\nMagnetic dopants in semiconductors have been extensively investigated for spintronic applications. Such doped systems, particularly those showing carrier-mediated ferromagnetism, are referred to as dilute magnetic semiconductors11,13) and represented by Mn-doped GaAs.12) On the basis of the results of first-principles calculations, the local atomistic, electronic, and magnetic structure of magnetic dopants and the resultant macroscopic properties have been discussed for a variety of established and potential dilute magnetic semiconductors, as reviewed in Ref. 291.\nAmorphous In–Ga–Zn–O semiconductors. The In–Ga–\nZn–O system is now recognized as a representative amorphous semiconductor with increasing industrial applications in thin-film transistors. Notably, its conduction band structure resembles that of the corresponding crystalline phase owing to the spatially extended nature of the In, Ga, and Zn s components, which leads to high electron mobility even in the amorphous phase.7,8) This behavior is in stark contrast to 060101-19 © \namorphous Si with covalent bonds. Both experimental and theoretical studies indicate that it is important to understand and control defects in amorphous In–Ga–Zn–O, as well as in crystalline semiconductors.8) Several types of defects and their roles in carrier generation and trapping have been discussed on the basis of the results of first-principles calculations, for example, in Refs. 8 and 292–295.\n4. Materials Design And Exploration: Design Principles, High-Throughput Screening, And Materials Informatics\nThe above first-principles approaches are applicable to the design and exploration of novel materials. Continuous development of computer performance now makes it possible to conduct in silico high-throughput screening of a large number of candidate compounds using first-principles calculations and=or prediction models constructed via machine learning of computational data sets. Most in silico screening of semiconductors thus far reported used only first-principles calculations. The search space accessible by this approach is limited by the computational costs, except in cases where only entries in preexisting databases are inspected. The exploration of novel materials typically considers particular chemical compositions and crystal structures that are selected on the basis of some design principles. We begin this section with a review of reported design principles for band structures and defect properties. Publicly open databases compiling the results of first-principles calculations are then described. Finally, in silico screening using first-principles calculations either within or outside the entries of such databases is discussed, along with the construction of prediction models using data science approaches.\n4.1 Design of band structure and defect characteristics 4.1.1 Band structure design based on chemical composition. Among compounds, nitrides and oxides are attractive owing to their earth-abundant nitrogen and oxygen constituents and thermal stability, especially for oxides. Although both p- and n-type doping of traditionally used compound semiconductors such as phosphides and arsenides is possible, many nitrides and oxides become only the n-type.\nTo overcome this difficulty with p-type doping, design principles for nitrides, oxides, and mixed-anion compounds based on them have been developed, as described below.\nIn typical nitrides and oxides, the N 2p and O 2p states are the main contributors to electronic states near the VBM.\nThese states are deep below the vacuum level compared to the anion p states in phosphides and arsenides; this chemical tendency is illustrated in Fig. 12, although, strictly speaking, the band positions depend on the chemical composition, crystal structure, and surface orientation, as mentioned in Sect. 3.3. The deep VBM tends to make hole doping difficult.103) In contrast, metal nitrides and oxides composed of elements such as Cu(I), Ag(I), Tl(I), Sn(II), Pb(II), Sb(III),\nand Bi(III) have cation orbital components near the N 2p and O 2p states,103,105,110,296–301) and the cationic and anionic states are hybridized with each other. This is shown schematically in Fig. 23 and illustrated by the case of SnO with Sn(II) in Fig. 4. Similarly, sizable hybridization near the VBM is identified in Sn(II) ternary oxides110,302,303) and Ba2BiTaO6 with Bi(III).301) An analogous effect is expected to\n![20_image_0.png](20_image_0.png)\nsome extent for oxides and nitrides of Zn and Cd, where the Zn 3d and Cd 4d states are located slightly below the O 2p and N 2p states; examples include ZnO (Fig. 3) and binary and ternary Zn nitrides, which are discussed later, in Sect. 4.3.\nAs a consequence of the presence of cationic states in the valence bands, these compounds typically have relatively high VBMs and small hole effective masses, both of which are favorable for p-type doping. Indeed, many Cu oxides readily become the p-type even without extrinsic doping.103)\np-type conductivity has also been reported for Sn and Bi oxides such as SnO104,265,266) and Ba2BiTaO6, 301) and this behavior is supported by first-principles studies of electronic structure and point defects.96,105,301)\nRelated electronic band structures are found in oxide-based mixed-anion compounds such as LaCuOS1−xSex, as reported by Hiramatsu et al.,304) and tetragonal ZrOS, as reported by Arai et al.305) In these compounds, the S or Se p states are located above the O 2p states in the valence bands and contribute mainly to the electronic states around the VBM.103,110,305) In other words, the anion states other than O 2p play a role analogous to that of the cation states. One may think that the resultant band structures around band gaps are similar to those of pure sulfides or selenides, but this does not necessarily hold because the presence of smaller and more ionic O ions could produce specific chemical environments for the S or Se ions.103,304,305) Such tunability of the band structures in mixed-anion compounds is attractive, as reviewed recently in Ref. 306.\nThe same concept appears to be useful for the design of other types of compounds. For instance, SnS with Sn(II) is known as a p-type semiconductor, as mentioned in Sect. 3.4.6, and its relatively small hole effective mass could be attributed in part to the Sn(II) contributions to the electronic states near the VBM.79) Organometal halide perovskites with Pb(II) have similar features in their band structures, as shown in Fig. 5. Ternary Cu(I) phosphides such as CaCuP, SrCuP, and BaCuP possess rather small hole effective masses, as reported recently by Williamson et al.307)\nAnother reported example of band structure design leading to semiconductivity is the consideration of 18-valence-electron ABX ternary compounds by Zakutayev et al.287) and Gautier et al.288) These compounds can have finite band gaps, by analogy with eight-electron AX binaries such as conventional III–V and II–VI compound semiconductors. As also mentioned later, they searched for previously unreported chemical compositions on the basis of these design principles and identified several promising semiconductors both theoretically and experimentally.287,288)\nAlloying of heterostructural semiconductors, which is mentioned in Sect. 3.2, can yield electronic structures and properties that are dissimilar to those of alloy components.\nPeng et al.308) and Holder et al.143) reported that Mn1−xZnxO\nalloys in the wurtzite structure, which is originally taken by ZnO but not by MnO, exhibit valence band structures that support hole transport and band gap tuning in the visible region, enabling their application to photoelectrochemical water splitting.\n4.1.2 Band structure design based on crystal structure and symmetry. The crystal structure and symmetry are important degrees of freedom for manipulating the band structure. Mizoguchi et al. reported that a high-pressure phase of SrGeO3 with cubic perovskite structure has an exceptionally narrow band gap of 2.7 eV among binary and ternary Ge oxides.309) The band structure type is indirect, and the optical absorption onset corresponds to its direct gap of 3.5 eV. Furthermore, La doping transforms it into a degenerate n-type conductor, demonstrating the realization of a Ge-based TCO. The experimentally observed narrow gap behavior is understandable in terms of the calculated conduction band structure and the concept of superdegeneracy, which prohibits hybridization of relevant orbitals at the Γ\npoint owing to a symmetry specific to the cubic perovskite structure (Fig. 24). Arai et al. later reported the presence of a nonbonding CBM state in a tetragonal phase of ZrOS and demonstrated its bipolar doping, together with a wide optical gap of ∼2.5 eV, deploying the parity-forbidden nature of the band-edge electronic transitions.305) Xiao et al. used an analogous orbital interaction approach to elucidate the exceedingly narrow band gap of β-BaZn2As2.\nA symmetry-relevant band structure design of transparent bipolar-dopable semiconductors has been reported by Nie et al.311) and Hosono et al.,266) where indirect-type band structures or direct-type band structures with parity-forbidden band-edge electronic transitions are advantageous for obtaining wide optical band gaps and bipolar doping simultaneously. Such band structures are recognized for CuInO2 311)\nas well as SnO104,105) (see Fig. 4), In2O3 118) (see Fig. 6), and tetragonal ZrOS,305) as mentioned above; among these, SnO\nand ZrOS are indeed bipolar dopable.\nOmata et al. reported the synthesis of β-CuGaO2 in a wurtzite-derived β-NaFeO2 structure via ion exchange of Na+\nions in the β-NaGaO2 precursor with Cu+ ions in CuCl.312) In contrast to the ordinary α phase in the delafossite structure, the β phase shows direct-type band structure with a gap of 1.47 eV. This band structure matches the solar spectrum well, indicating the potential of β-CuGaO2 for use as a solar cell photoabsorber.\nFirst-principles studies have predicted that nearly free electron states, which spread spatially toward surfaces or\n![21_image_0.png](21_image_0.png)\ninterlayer sites, constitute the CBM in the two-dimensional BN monolayer and bilayer.289,313) Matsushita et al. reported that analogous states also exist and even appear at the CBM in three-dimensional covalent semiconductors such as SiC\nand AlN.314) The floating nature of these electronic states at interstitial sites explains the band-gap variation and anisotropic effective masses of SiC polymorphs in terms of the length of the interstitial channels315) and produces specific interfacial states.316) Such electronic structures are related to those of inorganic electrides317,318) and therefore could lead to interesting functionalities.\n4.1.3 Design of defect properties. In practical applications of semiconductors, lattice defects are often crucial to the material properties or device performance. In particular, deep electronic states inside the band gap can trap carrier electrons and=or holes, degrading the efficiencies of light-emitting devices and photovoltaic cells. Ideally, the formation of point defects, dislocations, surfaces, and interfaces with such deep states is avoided as far as possible. This issue depends on both material's intrinsic characteristics and the processes used for material synthesis and device fabrication. Firstprinciples calculations can provide useful insights, especially into the former.\nZakutayev et al. have proposed the concept of defecttolerant semiconductors, where dangling bond states associated with point defects and surfaces tend to be shallow in some particular band structures.299) For example, these band structures occur in Cu compounds, where antibonding interactions between the Cu 3d and anion p states constitute electronic states near the VBM, as mentioned above. When vacancies or surfaces are formed, dangling bond states would appear below such antibonding states, that is, within the valence bands. Zakutayev et al. developed their discussion of defect tolerance in Ref. 299 by taking Cu3N as an example.\nSupporting their concept, relatively shallow cation vacancy states have been observed in Sn(II) binary and ternary oxides,105,110,302) as well as another Cu(I) binary, Cu2O.298,319)\nThe analogous defect properties of SnS with Sn(II) and CH3NH3PbI3 with Pb(II), which are mentioned in Sect. 3.4.6, can also be understood from this viewpoint.\nAn essentially identical concept is reported for valenceorbital-derived interfacial states, on the basis of the analysis 060101-21 © \nof grain boundaries in CuInSe2 by Yan et al.320) and in ZnO by Oba et al.321) In ZnO, especially strong bonding interactions between the Zn 4s states constitute the CBM\nstate; therefore, similar effects are expected for interfacial dangling bond states originating from the Zn 4s states.\n4.2 Computational databases Databases containing the results of first-principles calculations are useful in many ways. For instance, screening for materials exploration within databases is readily carried out; data are used to construct prediction models via machine learning; and data analysis leads to systematic understanding of materials.322–324) Several computational databases are currently open to the public, examples of which include the following (information as of January 7, 2018):\n- The Materials Project at www.materialsproject.org325)\ncontains 69,640 entries for inorganic compounds, 530,243 entries for nanoporous materials, and so forth.\nThis database covers a variety of material, thermodynamic, and electrochemical properties such as electronic band structures, elastic tensors, piezoelectric tensors, phase diagrams, and Pourbaix diagrams. These data are based on the results of first-principles calculations at the level of the GGA and GGA+U using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP)326,327) with additional energy corrections. Data search and analysis are available using the Materials Application Programming Interface (API)328) as well as the website.\n- The AFLOW Distributed Materials Property Repository at www.aflowlib.org, where AFLOW stands for Automatic-FLOW for Materials Discovery,329) contains 1,748,704 entries for materials, specifically, for a large number of alloys, and covers properties such as the electronic band structures and elastic properties. It supports the VASP and Quantum Espresso330,331) codes.\nThe data in this repository are accessible via the website and the AFLOWLIB REST API.332)\n- The Open Quantum Materials Database (OQMD) at oqmd.org333) contains 471,857 entries obtained using the PBE-GGA functional as implemented in the VASP\ncode and covers thermodynamic and structural properties. In particular, phase diagrams can be visualized online for not only two- to four-component systems but also larger component systems. An API called qmpy is provided for data analysis.\n- The Electronic Structure Project (ESP) at gurka.\nphysics.uu.se/esp contains ∼60,000 entries for theoretical electronic structures obtained using the fullpotential linear muffin-tin orbital method and the LDA.334)\n- The Open Materials Database at openmaterialsdb.se contains 205,264 entries for materials and 2787 for computations. It is designed so that researchers can programmatically interact, search, and process the data using the High-Throughput Toolkit.\n- The Novel Materials Discovery (NOMAD) Repository at repository.nomad-coe.eu contains 44,179,006 entries on the results of first-principles calculations.335) A notable feature of this repository is that it compiles computational results obtained using various program codes by different users. It currently supports 14 types of codes, and support for more is planned. Repository users can upload their own data, which may be restricted to the owners or made open to the public.\n- The Theoretical Crystallography Open Database\n(TCOD) at www.crystallography.net/tcod collects theoretically calculated or refined crystal structures of organic, inorganic, and metal–organic compounds and minerals, excluding biopolymers. There are currently 2682 entries.\nTo construct databases efficiently, first-principles calculations need to be performed for diverse systems automatically or at least semi-automatically. Several groups have developed program codes for this purpose, including those used for the Materials Project, AFLOW, OQMD, ESP, and Open Materials Database329,333,334,336) and others, for example, by Pizzi et al. in the Automated Interactive Infrastructure and Database for Computational Science (AiiDA) project337) and by Yim et al.338) Automation of fundamental and defect property calculations has also been reported, for example, band structure diagram construction,88,89) evaluation of electronic transport properties including effective masses,107)\nsurface modeling,164,165) and point defect modeling.249,339–342)\n4.3 In silico high-throughput screening and materials informatics toward materials discovery Screening using first-principles calculations is effective for exploring materials having desired functionalities if the target functionalities are closely related to the fundamental bulk and defect properties and if these properties are calculated with sufficient accuracy and speed. This typically holds for semiconductors; the predictable bulk and defect properties mentioned in Sect. 3 are excellent descriptors in many cases.\nMaterials are screened for such properties on the basis of design principles, for instance, those mentioned above. The procedure is schematically illustrated in Fig. 25. A straightforward approach is to search within preexisting computational databases. When previously unreported chemical compositions are explored, candidate systems are often constructed by replacing constituent elements of known crystals.343) However, novel materials could take as-yet-unreported crystal structures; therefore, global crystal structure searches are also performed for a given chemical composition,166) for example, using evolutionary,344–346) randomsearch,347) minima hopping,348) and conformational space annealing algorithms.349) Further, thermodynamic stability against decomposition into other phases and dynamic stability against lattice vibration need to be assessed for previously unreported materials; these characteristics are evaluated via phase diagram and phonon calculations, respectively, as done in Refs. 190, 287, 288, and 350. As a result of such firstprinciples screening, several studies successfully identified promising semiconductors, some of which have been verified experimentally, as described below.\np-type TCOs. Hautier et al. explored p-type TCOs using first-principles calculations of the band gaps, effective masses, and dopability.110) The considered candidates are 3052 oxides that are existing minerals or already synthesized materials and are reported in the Materials Project database.325) As a result of screening, they identified the promising systems shown in Fig. 26. Some of the identified compounds contain Sn(II),\nPb(II), and Tl(I), for example, K2Sn2O3, K2Pb2O3, PbTiO3, and Tl4V2O7, where electronic states around the VBM consist mainly of cationic orbitals. Others are mixed-anion systems 060101-22 © \n![23_image_0.png](23_image_0.png)\n![23_image_1.png](23_image_1.png)\nsuch as Ca4P2O, ZrOS, and B6O, where B is reported to behave as both a cation and an anion in B6O. Also identified is Sb4Cl2O5, which exhibits an Sb(III) orbital contribution to the VBM and has two types of anion components; therefore, this compound is categorized as belonging to both classes. These features in the band structure are compatible with the design principles discussed in Sect. 4.1.\nSarmadian et al. used an analogous approach to search for p-type TCOs, including mixed-anion systems.351) A total of 12,211 candidate materials taken from the AFLOW\nDistributed Materials Property Repository329) were considered in their first-principles screening, from which A2SeO2 systems, where A = La, Pr, Nd, and Gd, were identified as potential p-type transparent conductors.\nLi et al. explored previously unreported ternary oxides of Sn(II) and alkaline-earth metals.303) Through global structure searches using a combination of first-principles calculations and a particle swarm optimization technique, they identified SrSn2O3 and BaSn2O3 as stable compounds with electronic structures suitable for p-type conductivity.\nn-type TCOs. First-principles screening has also been carried out to identify not-yet-considered but promising ntype TCOs. Hautier et al. reported the screening of more than 4000 binary and ternary oxides for this purpose.322) Further, they derived chemical rules producing small electron effective masses via analysis of a large data set. Binary and ternary n-type TCOs with bixbyite structure have also been explored by Sarmadian et al.352)\nSolar cell photoabsorbers. As mentioned in Sect. 3.1.4, Yu, Zunger, and their coworkers calculated the photovoltaic energy conversion efficiencies as a function of absorber thickness and screened photoabsorber candidates on the basis of the predicted efficiencies.127,128) They considered Cu ternary and Ag ternary chalcogenides and ABX half-Heusler compounds129) as target systems and identified promising materials. Examples of the identified compounds are shown in Fig. 27, where the predicted efficiencies are compared to the Shockley–Queisser efficiency limit.126)\nMetal chalcohalides. Davies et al. performed highthroughput screening of ternary metal chalcohalides to 060101-23 © \n![24_image_0.png](24_image_0.png)\nexplore new photoactive semiconductors.350) A combination of element substitution and global structure searches was used after target systems were efficiently selected using compositional descriptors.353) As a result, Cd5S4Cl2 and Cd4SF6, which have band gaps in the visible range, small electron and hole effective masses, and good optical absorption properties, were identified.\n18-valence-electron systems. Zakutayev et al.287) and Gautier et al.288) performed first-principles screening of 18valence-electron ABX ternary compounds using a combination of element substitution and evolutionary algorithm approaches, as mentioned in Sect. 4.1. Gautier et al. identified 54 previously unreported but thermodynamically stable compounds, 15 of which have been verified experimentally.\nSome of the predicted and characterized compounds are proposed to be potential transparent conductors, thermoelectric materials, and topological semimetals.288) Ternary copper nitrides. Nitride semiconductors, particularly systems with three or more components, are much less explored than oxide semiconductors,354) even after the successful industrial application of GaN and its alloys. This is partly because of a difficulty in the synthesis of nitrides, so computational searches would be especially useful. Zakutayev et al. explored ternary Cu nitrides for photovoltaic absorber applications using first-principles calculations and an element substitution approach.355) They included thermodynamically metastable compounds in the target materials, motivated by their successful synthesis of the metastable CuNbN2. As a result, Cu3Ga2N3, Cu3In2N3, and their alloys were identified as promising candidates in view of their band gaps, absorption coefficients, and effective masses.\nTernary zinc nitrides. Another example of the identification of nitride semiconductors is a search for novel ternary zinc nitride semiconductors, followed by experimental verification of the most promising compound, by Hinuma et al.190) Zn nitrides have valence band structures favorable for p-type doping, as mentioned in Sect. 4.1. Unfortunately, p-type doping of the binary zinc nitride Zn3N2 would be difficult, despite its promising valence band structure, because strong hole compensation is caused by N vacancies, as well as H and O impurities.122) In contrast, such compensation is likely to be well suppressed in some ternary systems, as described below.190)\nFigure 28(a) shows ternary zinc nitrides identified by firstprinciples screening of approximately 600 candidates using a combination of element substitution and evolutionary algorithm approaches. These 21 systems are dynamically stable against lattice vibration and thermodynamically stable or slightly metastable (formation energies less than 50 meV=atom), and they have effective masses as small as or smaller than that of GaN for electrons, holes, or both. The identified nitrides fall into three categories: (i) previously reported Zn nitride semiconductors, (ii) Zn nitrides whose synthesis is reported but whose semiconductor properties are unexplored, and (iii) Zn nitrides unreported in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD).356) The identification of group (i) validates the in silico screening methods, procedures, and criteria. Systems in groups (ii) and (iii) are of interest in light of their novelty as semiconductors. The authors focused on CaZn2N2 in group (iii) because of several promising features, as shown in Fig. 28(b): its earth-abundant constituent elements; direct-type band structure that is suitable for light emission and harvesting, specifically, the red light emission expected from the theoretical gap of 1.8 eV; the small electron and hole effective masses; and the bipolar dopability predicted by assessment of native point defects and dopants. This novel phase has been realized by high-pressure synthesis at 1200 °C and 5.0 GPa for 1 h, which were predicted to be viable synthesis conditions from phase diagram calculations. The theoretically predicted crystal structure and optical properties, including red light emission\n[Fig. 28(b)], have been experimentally verified. The resultant experimental direct band gap of 1.9 eV is in good agreement with the predicted value of 1.8 eV. Experimental verification of the transport properties through film growth and carrier doping is awaited.\nSummary and other examples of first-principles screening.\nThese studies on TCOs, photoabsorbers, 18-electron ABX\ncompounds, and ternary Cu and Zn nitrides demonstrate the power of first-principles screening for the identification of materials whose semiconducting properties or even synthesis have not been reported previously. Related examples of screening studies include searches for nonoxide p-type transparent conductors, where BP has been identified as a promising system;324) for perovskites as potential semiconductors and dielectrics;357,358) and for photocatalysts such as oxide and mixed-anion perovskites,359,360) nitrides, oxynitrides,361)\nternary Sn(II) oxides,362) and ternary vanadates.363) Materials exploration using first-principles calculations has also been reviewed, for example, in Refs. 21 and 22.\nData-science-based approaches. In silico screening of candidate materials can be accelerated and enhanced by data science approaches. Efforts have been made to predict various properties, among which the band gap is particularly important for the exploration of novel semiconductors. Ward et al. reported band-gap prediction using the chemical compositions and information on the constituent elements of materials.364) After testing several machine learning algo060101-24 © \n![25_image_0.png](25_image_0.png)\nrithms, they obtained mean absolute errors of as small as 0.06 eV in a 10-fold cross-validation test of a single model trained on the DFT results for 228,676 crystalline compounds selected from the OQMD.333)\nDey et al. predicted the band gaps of over 200 new chalcopyrite compounds with as-yet-unreported chemistries using an ensemble data mining approach.365) Pilania et al.\nreported band-gap prediction for quinary double perovskites using kernel ridge regression.366) Such multicomponent systems are difficult to tackle using only first-principles calculations because a vast number of possible configurations of constituent elements exist even within a single crystal structure type.\nLee et al. took a pragmatic approach in which theoretical band gaps at the level of the GW approximation were predicted from the results of computationally much less demanding PBE-GGA and mBJ-meta-GGA calculations, along with information on the constituent elements of the target materials.367) They obtained a band-gap prediction model with a root-mean-square error of 0.24 eV by learning 270 inorganic compounds using nonlinear support vector regression. This approach could eventually reach higher accuracy than machine learning using only the information on the chemical composition and constituent elements, but this advantage would be offset by the computational costs required for calculations at the LDA, GGA, or meta-GGA\nIn addition to the prediction of band gaps and other properties of semiconductors, machine learning has been used to identify materials that are as yet unreported but likely to be synthesized.368,369) Such approaches would be useful for accelerating the discovery of novel materials\n5. Concluding Remarks\nA tremendous number of theoretical and computational studies of semiconductors have thus far been reported from both academia and industry, only some of which are covered in this review. Historically, first-principles approaches have been used to understand known semiconducting materials in terms of the fundamental, thermodynamic, and defect properties that are directly accessible by calculations. With the development of relevant theory and computational schemes, as well as computer performance, high-throughput screening for the exploration of novel materials can now be done in silico. More than ten million results of first-principles calculations are already available in public repositories, and searching for materials within these databases is a compelling approach. Another option is to explore materials with as-yetunreported compositions and=or crystal structures. In both cases, reliable design principles, as well as accurate and efficient computational schemes, are key requirements for successful identification of target materials and functionalities. Theoretical calculations of band structures and defect properties are helpful for deriving such design principles, given that their systematic investigation and understanding are usually difficult to realize by experiment alone. Moreover, data-science-oriented approaches to issues in materials science and engineering are emerging. With the deployment of high-throughput computation and experimentation in addition to available databases, we expect a growing number of successful applications of such materials informatics approaches to practical development of materials.\n(Grant No. 17H01318) and Young Scientists A (Grant No.\n15H05541) from JSPS, PRESTO (Grant No. JPMJPR16N4), and the Support Program for Starting Up Innovation Hub MI2I from JST, Japan.\n1) S.

The saturation on current reached 1 mA, and the off-state leakage current was below 1 pA. The Vth shift under PBT / NBT stress test for the IGZO TFT was 0.1 / í0.1 V, respectively, which was better compared to the n-LTPS. Furthermore, the IGZO TFT showed an ideal Id-Vd curve (output characteristics) without any kinks.

Introduction As current-driven displays become mainstream, the demand for high mobility and high reliability transistor is rapidly increasing. A pixel and driver circuit with high on current will enable to achieve narrow frame, high speed and high-resolution display. A TFT with high on current will also improve circuit configuration flexibility. Currently, low temperature polysilicon (LTPS) is widely used to achieve high on current. However, LTPS has several shortages. At first, its off-state leakage current is high. Therefore, it is difficult to operate LTPS display at low frequency for low power consumption. Next, LTPS process takes high cost because it includes relatively high temperature process (>450 °C) \nand many specific process steps such as laser annealing and ionimplementation. Furthermore, use of LTPS is limited only for small and medium size display due to the excimer laser size. It's been only eleven years since the potential of Amorphous Oxide Semiconductor (AOS) was greatly realized in 2004 . One of AOS, In–Ga–Zn–O (IGZO) TFT has already been used for various flat panel displays including 80-inch 8K LCD-TV, LCD smartphone, and Rollable OLED-TV. IGZO TFT has advantages of very low off-state leakage current and relatively simple process steps compared to LTPS. On the other hand, the main drawback of the IGZO TFT is its low on current. Although mobility of IGZO is over one order of magnitude higher than that of an a:Si:H, it is still a fraction of that of an LTPS. Therefore, large gate on array (GOA) circuit and higher driving voltages are required to achieve similar performance as the LTPS panel. To overcome this issue the best approach is to enhance mobility of the IGZO TFT. From the material science standpoint, mobility of the IGZO can be increased by adjusting composition ratio. Generally high mobility can be achieved by reducing carrier suppressor. However, when the density of carrier suppressor in IGZO system is reduced, the oxygen vacancies increases. These oxygen vacancies act as shallow donor. Therefore, it is difficult to control the threshold voltage (Vth) and the reliability degradation in high mobility IGZO system. In recent year Apple Inc. introduced a new approach namely LTPO, to take advantage of both LTPS and IGZO technologies . With LTPO architecture it is possible to produce low power consumption and low refresh rates display. On the other hand, the LTPO architecture is quite complex as both the LTPS and IGZO process need to be run side-by-side. As a consequence, issues such as production time, yield and cost have to be acknowledged. Furthermore, the panel size for LTPO architecture is limited to the size of LTPS process. Despite these disadvantages, LTPS architecture is now under mass production, which strongly implies the demand of high mobility TFTs. So far various device manufacturers and material manufacturers tried to develop oxide TFT with high on current, however the performance is merely similar to the LTPS. To the best of our knowledge, there are very few reports about AOS-TFT with high on current in mass production. SHARP Corp. started mass production of the IGZO-LCDs in 2012 for the first time in the world . Since then, we have improved the mobility by 1.5 times higher and evolved the IGZO generation aiming to expand the range of IGZO technology application as an alternative to LTPS . Figure 1 shows the Hall mobility of different IGZO films as a function of the carrier concentration. Every time the IGZO layer evolved, the Hall mobility increased. From IGZO3 to IGZO6 the Hall mobility was enhanced from 10 cm2/Vs to 50 cm2/Vs. \nIn this paper, we report IGZO7 TFT with an on current similar to the n-LTPS TFT. Furthermore, various performance comparison between IGZO7 and n-LTPS are discussed. \n2. Igzo And N-Ltps Tft Fabrication Process\nIGZO TFT: The IGZO TFTs were fabricated on a PI/glass substrate. We have adopted IGZO TFTs with both top and bottom gate (double gate) to enhance its on current. Previously, we have reported top-gate IGZO (TG-IGZO) fabrication process . This time we have added bottom gate layer under the TG-IGZO \nstructure to form double gate structure. Figure 2 shows the crosssectional image of double gate structure. The main hurdle for the \nIGZO7 process development was to obtain an enhancement mode TFT with good uniformity. To control the TFT characteristics, we have established a process to balance oxygen and hydrogen in the gate insulator and IGZO channel simultaneously. By this process, an enhancement mode IGZO TFT with high mobility and high reliability was obtained successfully. \nLTPS TFT: The n-channel LTPS TFTs were fabricated on a PI/glass substrate by means of the conventional process. The a-Si layer was deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) and crystallized by excimer laser. The top poly-Si was doped by an ion doping system. To achieve good TFT properties H (hydrogen) process was carefully optimized. Process comparison: The production of IGZO TFT is simple. An a-si:H fab can be easily converted to an IGZO fab. LTPS process is more complex than IGZO because it needs additional equipment, an excimer laser to crystallize Si and an ion implanter for doping. Therefore, LTPS process has higher initial and maintenance cost. In the viewpoint of mass production, IGZO is advantageous since the number of process requirement is less than that of LTPS. Furthermore, it is difficult to achieve in-plane Vth uniformity of the LTPS TFT. We have compared Vth variation of LTPS and IGZO TFTs of the G4 (730 mm  920 mm) MG. \nLTPS TFTs showed a Vth variation (ı) of 0.3 V, which was relatively higher than IGZO TFTs of 0.2 V. This variation will cause uneven color composition in OLED display. To solve this problem, camera compensation technique is needed. The high uniformity in the IGZO TFTs is expected to omit the camera compensation, hence reduces the cost and time. \n3. Results And Discussion\nTFTs performance: The transfer characteristics of TFT were measured in dark environment at room temperature using Agilent B1500A semiconductor device analyzer system. Figure 3(a) shows the Id-Vg (transfer characteristics) of the fabricated IGZO7 and n-LTPS TFT. Their active areas length and width L / W were 7.5 μm / 10 μm, and they had 100 nm-thickSiO2 TGI. The drain bias voltage (Vds) was set to 10 V, and the drain current (Id) was measured while the gate bias voltage (Vg) \nwas swept from í15 V to 20 V. Both the IGZO7 and n-LTPS TFT \nshowed good electrical properties with a threshold voltage (Vth) of 0.95 V and 1.44 V, respectively. The comparison of the transfer characteristics parameters is listed in the Table 1. The subthreshold swing (S.S.) was calculated as the difference of two Vg values corresponding to Id = 1 nA and 10 nA. The S.S. value of the IGZO7 TFT was 0.11 V/dec., smaller than 0.27 V/dec. for that of n-LTPS TFTs. The S.S. value suggests that the IGZO7 TFT has very small numbers of defects in the active channel.  The most distinctive feature of the IGZO7 TFT is its low Ioff and high Ion values. In an ideal TFT, no current should flow when the TFT is turned off, while the on current should be as high as possible. The current which flows in the off-state is referred as off-state leakage current. This leakage current may cause errors in the circuit and increase the power consumption. Device application, in the internet of things (IoT) in particular, requires a low standby power consumption. Therefore off-state leakage current is one of the most important parameters for the display application. In this report, the fabricated IGZO7 TFT exhibited \n| S.S.   | Ion @ Vg=20V   | Ioff @ Vg=Ѹ15V   |     |    |\n|--------|----------------|------------------|-----|----|\n| [V]    | [V/dec.]       | [A]              | [A] |    |\n| Vth    |                |                  |     |    |\n| n-LTPS | 1.44           |                   | 4.2™10-4     | 4.2™10-10    |\n| IGZO   | 0.95           |                   | 3.9™10-4     | <1.0™10-12    |\nInvited Paper 24-1 / K. Ito\nvery low off-state leakage current, actually under the measurement detection level. In contrast, the n-LTPS TFT \nshowed very high off-state leakage current of 0.5 nA at Vg = í15 V, even if its channel length was as long as 7.5 ȝm. The LTPS \noff-state leakage current can be reduced with the increase of channel length, which is instead disadvantages from the perspective of small circuit. Alongside very low off-state leakage current, the IGZO7 TFT also owned high on current of about 0.4 mA at Vg = 20 V, which was similar to n-LTPS TFT. IGZO TFT with such high on current enables us to design small size GOA circuit with low driving voltage. Figure 3 (b) compares the Id-Vd (output characteristics) of the IGZO7 and n-LTPS TFTs. An output characteristic is composed with linear and saturation region. The IGZO7 TFT showed almost an ideal Id-Vd curve, where Id did not vary with the Vds in the saturation. In contrast, Id for the n-LTPS TFTs gradually increased with the Vds in the saturation. This phenomenon is generally known as kink effect and caused by the impact ionization. This is a serious problem for current-driven display, which needs good current-saturation characteristics. Kink effect can be reduced by extending the channel length or adopting a gate overlapped LDD (GOLD) structure, although these solutions require larger circuit or more process steps. Contrary to LTPS TFT, the IGZO TFT does not need to care about this issue. Furthermore, the IGZO7 TFT with a short channel (L = 4 μm) did not show any kink effect (data not shown here). Figure 4 depicts the transfer characteristics of the IGZO7 TFTs measured with Vds = 0.1 and 10 V. The channel length L was varied from 4 to 7.5 μm, while the channel width was fixed at 10 μm. Table 2 summarizes the TFT properties shown in the figure 4. All the TFTs showed enhancement behavior with a Vth of 0.87 V, 0.91 V, and 0.95 V for the L = 4, 6, and 7.5 μm, respectively. \nThe S.S. of all the TFTs are 0.1 V/dec.. The standard deviation (ı) \nof the Vth was 0.17 for L = 4 ȝm, showing high uniformity for the short channel TFT. Generally, it is difficult to control the Vth of high mobility TFT, especially for the short channel TFT. To realize the high Vth uniformity, we have optimized the process both for the channel and TGI. For the IGZO7 TFTs, Ion value clearly increased with the decrease of channel length, and it reached 1 mA for L = 4 μm. As the IGZO7 TFTs show enhancement mode Vth with high Ion/Ioff ratio, small size GOA circuit with high efficiency is possible. Figure 5 shows temperature dependence of the transfer characteristics of the TFTs with n-LTPS and IGZO7. The measurement temperature was adjusted from the room temperature to 120 °C. With the measurement temperature, the IGZO7 TFT characteristics did not change except a small positive Vth shift. The on current and the off-state leakage current did not depend on the temperature. In contrast, the n-LTPS TFT showed much larger temperature dependence. Although it maintained the same on current and Vth, the off-state leakage current gradually increased with the measurement temperature. This suggests that more carriers were emitted from the drain space charge region, probably due to the defects in the LTPS grain boundary, and that the emission was enhanced by the measurement temperature. Therefore, IGZO7 TFT is advantageous for high temperature driving. \nTFT's Bias Stress Reliability: Figure 6 (a) summarizes the Vth shift under positive and negative bias temperature stress (PBT and NBT) for the TFTs with IGZO7 and n-LTPS active channel. \nA gate voltage stress of +30 V and í30 V, respectively, was Id (A)\n|               | L = 4 ȝm   | L = 6 ȝm   | L = 7.5 ȝm   |\n|---------------|------------|------------|--------------|\n| Vth [V]       | 0.87       | 0.91       | 0.95         |\n| VthȪ          |             | 0.15       | 0.15         |\n| S.S.

Under PBT stress the IGZO7 TFT showed very small shift of +0.3 V compared to +0.75 V shift of the n-LTPS TFT. In general, high mobility AOS TFT shows large Vth shift under PBT test, due to the oxygen deficiency. Therefore, the very small Vth shift in IGZO7 TFT indicates that the density of defects in the IGZO channel and/or the IGZO/TGI interface was reduced by the optimized process. Under NBT stress, the negative Vth shift of the IGZO7 TFT was í0.35 V, which is reasonable for high mobility TFTs. These Vth shift under PBT and NBT stress were small enough for OLED display. The NBIT test shown in the Fig. 6 (b) was conducted as similar condition of the NBT test with a white light of 10 Klux. The negative Vth shift of the IGZO7 TFT under NBIT stress for 3,600s was í0.75 V. Although the Vth shift was worse compared to the n-\nLTPS TFTs, it was still below 1 V. Moreover, during this NBIT test, we have irradiated light directly over the TFTs. In contrast, for the OLED panel, the anode of the OLED would act as light shielding. Therefore, this NBIT degradation value of IGZO7 TFT would not impact the mass production. \n4. Conclusion We have succeeded in developing high mobility and high performance TFTs with IGZO7. It was confirmed that IGZO7 TFT could obtain high on current equivalent to n-LTPS TFT. IGZO7 TFT also showed very low off-state leakage current, the Id-Vd characteristics without kink, small temperature dependence, and similar level of reliability to the n-LTPS TFT. These results indicate that IGZO7 TFT can realize low refresh rate and narrow bezel OLED display with simple process. Therefore, a variety of backplanes, from small size smartphones to large area TVs, is possible to be made in a single factory of IGZO. "

        "text": "Development Of High-Mobility Top-Gate Igzto-Tft And Suppression Of Threshold Voltage Shift In Short Channel Utilizing Laser Irradiation Process\nMitsuru Nakata*, Mototaka Ochi**, Tatsuya Takei*, Hiroshi Tsuji*, \nMasashi Miyakawa*, Kohei Nishiyama**, Yoshiki Nakajima*, and Takahisa Shimizu* \n* NHK Science & Technology Research Laboratories, Tokyo, Japan \n** **Kobe Steel Ltd., Applied Physics Research Laboratory, Hyogo, Japan**\nTop-gate self-aligned thin-film transistors (TFTs) with a high carrier mobility of 31 cm2*/Vs were developed using the oxide* semiconductor In-Ga-Zn-Sn-O. The threshold-voltage shift in short-channel top-gate TFTs was suppressed by application of a laser irradiation process to reduce the resistance of the source/drain regions\nIGZTO; high mobility; self-aligned structure; top-gate structure; thin-film transistor 1. Introduction Thin-film transistors (TFTs) that consist of oxide semiconductors such as In-Ga-Zn-O (IGZO) (1) are promising devices to drive large-screen organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays, because they have a sufficiently high carrier mobility \n(approximately 10 cm2/Vs) and are adaptable to large-area fabrication. Oxide TFTs should have a high ON current and low parasitic capacitance for use in OLED displays to achieve high resolution, high frame rate, and low power consumption. An increase of the carrier mobility and/or a reduction of the channel length are effective ways to achieve a high ON current. It is also necessary to ensure a high degree of electrical reliability when these materials are applied to the mass production of OLED displays. We have already developed back-channel-etched (BCE) \nTFTs with a high mobility of >40 cm2/Vs using In-Ga-Zn-Sn-O \n(IGZTO) by optimization of both the IGZTO composition (In, Ga, Zn, and Sn contents) and the fabrication process (2). Optimization of the Sn content in IGZTO enhances both the mobility and stability under negative bias thermal illumination stress, as compared to the values for IGZO (3). However, the parasitic capacitance due to the overlap between the gate and source/drain (S/D) electrodes in the BCE structure produces a resistive-capacitive (RC) delay, which is one of the issues in the increase of the number of pixels and the screen size. A top-gate self-aligned structure is effective to resolve the issue because it can reduce the overlap. In the top-gate structure, the S/D regions are formed by selectively increasing the carrier density in a semiconductor film through the use of a gate electrode as a mask. Several methods have been proposed for reducing the oxide semiconductor resistance through plasma treatments (4-6), aluminum reactions (7), or wet etching treatments (8). Our group has also proposed excimer laser irradiation methods for the fabrication of bottom-gate self-aligned oxide TFTs (9, 10). In this study, high-mobility top-gate TFTs were developed using IGZTO as a channel layer. In addition, a top-gate TFT fabrication method that is effective to shorten the channel length was developed. There is an issue with top-gate TFTs, in that highdensity free carriers in the S/D regions diffuse into the channel, which increases the carrier concentration of the channel region and shifts the threshold voltage (Vt) to the negative direction, especially in short channel TFTs (11-13). The Vt shift in short channel TFTs was successfully suppressed by application of a solid-state pulse laser irradiation process with a significantly short processing time (7 ns) and high directivity to reduce the resistance of the S/D regions. Furthermore, in the case of this laser irradiation process, there is no need to pattern the gate insulator, so that the effects of simplifying the process and enabling a more accurate selfalignment process can be obtained. \n2. Experimental Procedure\nFigure 1(a) shows a cross-sectional schematic diagram of the laser irradiation method used to reduce the resistance of the S/D regions in top-gate self-aligned IGZTO-TFTs. For comparison, a conventional Ar plasma treatment method is also shown in Fig. 1(b). In this study, top-gate self-aligned IGZTO-TFTs were fabricated using these methods. After formation of a SiOx underlayer on a glass substrate, an IGZTO film was formed by \n7-4 / M. Nakata Late-News Paper\nsputtering with an IGZTO target, the composition of which was optimized for high mobility (2). Pre-annealing at 300 °C for 1 h was performed in air. A SiOx gate insulator (GI) film was deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) at 300 °C. A Mo-alloy gate electrode was then deposited and patterned. In the case of the laser irradiation process, the stacked layers on which the gate insulator was not patterned were irradiated with a solid-state pulse laser in the direction from the gate electrode, as shown in Fig. 1(a). The wavelength and pulse width of the laser were 266 nm and 7 ns, respectively. The stacked layers were irradiated by scanning the substrate, and each point on the substrate was irradiated 5 times. The IGZTO region overlapping the gate electrode receives no irradiation, because the light is reflected away at the gate electrode. In contrast, the IGZTO regions that do not overlap the gate electrode are irradiated because the laser light is transmitted through the SiOx gate insulator. The temperature of these regions is significantly increased by absorption of the laser light, which breaks the metal and oxygen bonds in IGZTO, and results in the generation of many oxygen vacancies that can act as donors. Therefore, the resistance of these regions can be reduced due to increased free carrier density (9, 10). On the other hand, in the case of the conventional Ar plasma treatment process, a gate insulator was patterned using the gate electrode as a mask to expose the IGZTO surface to plasma. The Ar plasma treatment was then conducted for 3 min, as shown in Fig. 1(b). A SiOx interlayer was deposited by PECVD for the samples treated with both resistance reduction processes. After the formation of contact holes, Mo alloy was deposited and patterned as S/D electrodes. The length between the S/D electrodes and the channel region was 4 ȝm. \n3. Results The sheet resistance of the IGZTO film irradiated with laser light was measured by the four-point probe method to investigate the effect of resistance reduction by laser irradiation. The sample was composed of IGZTO films on a glass substrate. Figure 2 shows the dependence of the IGZTO sheet resistance on the laser energy \ndensity. The IGZTO sheet resistance was more than 108 Ȑ/ڧ before laser irradiation, which was decreased significantly by an increase in the laser energy density to become 1.9103 Ȑ/ڧ at a laser energy density of 200 mJ/cm2. This sheet resistance is estimated to be sufficiently low to be negligible with respect to the resistance of the oxide semiconductor channel region (10). When the laser energy density is from 150 to 220 mJ/cm2, the IGZTO \nsheet resistance was almost constant with respect to the laser \nLate-News-Paper 7-4 / M. Nakata\nenergy density. This result indicates the possibility of a wide process margin with respect to the laser energy density. When the laser energy density was more than 240 mJ/cm2, the IGZTO sheet resistance was increased. We consider that this is due to the structural change of the IGZTO films, such as crystallization by high energy laser irradiation. Figure 3 shows the transfer characteristics of top-gate IGZTO-TFTs irradiated at laser energy densities of 100, 120, and 200 mJ/cm2. The sheet resistances for 100, 120, and 200 mJ/cm2 were more than 108, 7.3u104, and 1.9u103 Ȑ/ڧ, respectively, as shown in Fig. 2. The channel width \n(W) and length (L) were 50 and 10 ȝm, respectively. The drain voltage (Vd) was 0.1 V. The results clearly show that the ON \n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png) ![2_image_1.png](2_image_1.png)\ncurrent increases significantly with the laser energy density. When the laser energy density was 100 and 120 mJ/cm2, high resistance in the S/D regions acts as a parasitic resistance. In the case of 200 mJ/cm2, the ON current was improved because the resistance of the S/D regions was sufficiently reduced, and a field effect mobility of 31 cm2/Vs was obtained. In the laser irradiation process, there is no need to pattern the gate insulator, because the laser light is transmitted through the SiOx film, as shown in Fig. 1(a), which simplifies the top-gate TFT fabrication process. In the conventional plasma treatment process, the gate insulator must be patterned to expose the oxide material to plasma, as shown in Fig. 1(b). In this case, the S/D regions are formed using the gate insulator as a mask instead of the gate electrode. Therefore, variation in the etching of the gate insulator causes an increase in parasitic capacitance or an increase in parasitic resistance due to the formation of an offset region. The laser irradiation process can solve these problems. The dependence of the transfer characteristics on L of the top-gate IGZTO-TFTs fabricated by laser irradiation and Ar plasma treatment were evaluated next to investigate the effect of Vt shift suppression in a short channel. Figure 4 shows the dependence of Vt on L for the top-gate TFTs. Figure 5 shows the transfer characteristics of the top-gate TFTs with L=3 and 1 ȝm, where W \nwas fixed at 10 ȝm. In both processes, Vt was almost the same when the channel length was 5 ȝm or greater, as shown in Fig. 4. \nHowever, in the case of Ar plasma treatment, Vt shifted negatively when L was less than 4 ȝm. When L was less than 2 ȝm, the OFF \ncurrent was extremely high and no switching performance was obtained. This is attributed to the high density of free carriers in the S/D regions that diffuse into the channel layer due to the long process time of 3 min where Ar ions collide with IGZTO in random directions. On the other hand, no large negative Vt shift was observed with the laser irradiation process, when L was 3 ȝm. \nFigure 5(a) shows the effect of the suppression of Vt shift by the laser irradiation process. Furthermore, switching performances were obtained even when the channel length was 1 ȝm, although Vt shift was observed, as shown in Fig. 5(b). These results are attributed to the suppression of lateral carrier diffusion by the laser irradiation process with a significantly short processing time of 7 ns and high directivity. \n4. Summary We have developed top-gate self-aligned TFTs with a high mobility of 31 cm2/Vs using IGZTO, which are promising for achieving both high mobility and low parasitic capacitance. We have also developed a method for resistance reduction of the S/D region in the top-gate TFTs using solid-state pulse laser irradiation, which can suppress the Vt shift in short channels. This process can suppress lateral carrier diffusion from the S/D regions because of the laser irradiation process with a significantly short processing time of 7 ns and high directivity. The top-gate self-aligned TFT can be operated even for a short channel with L=1 ȝm. This method also simplifies the fabrication process and reduces the processing variation because it does not require etching of the gate insulator. "

The best performance of oxide TFTs can be obtained at the boundary between the amorphous and crystalline phases –. Therefore, in these Sn-doped IZO TFTs, a number of nanocrystals are embedded in the amorphous matrix and formed hybrid-phase microstructure to achieve the best performance , . Compared to the pristine polycrystalline ZnO, it is believed that the microstructure together with the material composition can result to thin films with lower grain boundary and deep defect density inside. Thus, the conduction and noise performance of hybrid-phase Sn-doped IZO thin film transistors may be differ to existing amorphous or polycrystalline thin film transistors.\nLow frequency noise (LFN) is a key parameter for analog and RF applications –, and it sets the lower limit of the signal that can be processed and detected in the subsequent circuits and modules . Moreover, LFN may up-convert to high frequencies and then become to a source of phase noise, which may adversely affect the application of devices in RF fields , . The source and dominant mechanism of LFNs in metal oxide TFTs have been examined by many groups , –. Due to localized states existed in the active channel, the noise levels in these devices are always higher than that in MOSFETs , .\nTo integrate more functions on the same substrate, the channel length of devices should be reduced from typical values of L=10 µm to L=1-2 µm, or less , . Thence, contact resistance and short channel effects may affect device performance and there should be controlled for proper operation of these devices –. Up to now, the effects of channel length on conduction performance have been examined ,\n, . However, the dimension scaling effects on LFN\nof Sn-doped IZO TFTs has less been reported. Thus, it is valuable to study the variation of low frequency noise with the decrement of channel length.\nIn this work, dimension scaling effect on conduction and noise performance of ITO-stabilized ZnO TFTs are investigated with channel lengths down to 5 µm. Firstly, the electrical parameters are extracted and the variations in device conduction performance due to short channel effects are discussed.\nSecondly, low frequency noise are measured in these devices.\nThe source and dominant mechanism of LFN with varied channel length are examined.

Device Structure And I-V Characteristics\nFig. 1 shows the cross-section view of top gate ITOstabilized ZnO TFTs used in this work. Thermally oxidized SiO2 of 500 nm thick was coated on 4-inch circular glass wafers, followed by the formation of ITO source/drain electrodes. A active layer (50 nm-thick) was then co-sputtered and patterned into active islands by wet etching. During deposition, the oxygen partial pressure ratio (O2/(Ar+O2)) and DC/RF sputtering power combination adopted were 40% and 120/150 W, respectively. Subsequently, 150 nm-thick SiO2 was deposited by PECVD as a gate dielectric layer. A 100 nm-thick ITO layer was then sputtered and patterned as gate electrodes.\nThe devices were then annealed at 573 K in air. In the last, the devices were passivated by 300 nm-thick SiO2 using PECVD,\nfollowed by the definition of contact holes and test pads. The experiment details have been reported previously , , .\nBy use of Agilent B1500, the transfer curves (Ids − Vgs)\nof ITO-stabilized ZnO TFTs (with W=50 µm and different channel lengths) are measured, as shown in Fig. 2. The extracted threshold voltage (Vth), field effect mobility (µ*e f f*)\nand sub-threshold swing (S S ) are given in Table I. The threshold voltages were extracted by use of linear extrapolation method, and the field effect mobility were calculated in the ohmic region when Vgs − Vth = 5V.\nAs shown in Table I, when channel length is less than 25 µm, the extracted threshold voltage may decrease with channel \n![1_image_4.png](1_image_4.png) \nlength decreases. This phenomena is also observed in the short channel amorphous IGZO TFTs . As reported by Kang DH , due to carrier diffusion from source/drain regions to the active channel, the Fermi level may shift towards the conduction band with the decrement of channel length, which leads to the negative shift of Vth . In addition, S S keeps nearly constant with the decrement of channel length.\nThe degradation of field effect mobility in short channel devices may dominate by the contact resistance , . Unlike conventional MOSFETs, ITO-stabilized ZnO TFTs do not have a stable doped source/drain regions. A weak ohmic contact may exist caused by the mismatch between the work functions of the active region and the electrode. Thus, the contacts may play a dominant role in short devices, which caused mobility decreases with the decrement of channel lengths , .\nthe Electron Devices Society\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png) \nThe calculated total resistance versus channel length are plotted in the Fig. 3(a). Based on transmission line method\n, , the calculated total resistance is close to the value of contact resistance when the channel length approximated to 0. Therefore, the value of contact resistance can be extracted by use of linear extrapolation. When Vds=0.5 V, the calculated contact resistances in the linear region at Vgs-Vth=5 V are about 6.36 MΩ. Moreover, the extracted resistance varies with Vgs − Vth which follows an empirical expression Rsd = Rsd0(Vgs − Vth)−β, . In this paper, Rsd0 is about 3.03 MΩ and β is about 0.95.\nIii. Low Frequency Noise\nThe typical drain current noise power spectral densities\n(S ID) versus frequency (f) are measured at different gate voltages (Vgs) in the ITO-stabilized ZnO TFTs with W/L=\n50 µm/100 µm. As shown in Fig. 4, S ID follow a 1/ f γlaw and γ is about -1.1. It suggests the flicker noise is the main noise source of LFN which is results by fluctuations of the interfacial trapped charges. The deviation from 1 of γ indicates that the vertical distribution of trap density is nonuniform in the gate insulator , . γ > 1 is occupied when the oxide trap density is lower close to the SiO2/channel interface than that in the interior of the gate insulator. In addition, the value of γ is also related to the localized state density and its energy distribution in the band-gap (characteristic temperature) .\nIn order to study the effect of variation of channel length on LFN, the noises have been measured at different drain current on five devices with W=50 µm and L=100, 50, 25, 10, 5 µm.\nThe dependence of S ID on Ids of above devices are plotted in the Fig. 5. As shown in the Fig. 5, the measured noise increases with decreasing channel length. The measured noise in the smallest device is more than two order of magnitude higher than that of the largest one.\nAs shown in Fig. 6, the normalized noise is inversely proportional to the channel length and the slope in a duallog plot is about -0.75. This phenomena further confirms that the observed low frequency noise in the ITO-stabilized ZnO\nTFTs is flicker noise. However, differ to that observed in the \nIGZO TFTs , the contribution from TFT series contact resistance cannot be ignored which may results to the variation of field effect mobility and thus the variation of normalized noise. Therefore, the slope of noise versus channel length may deviate from -1.\nThere are two classic model used for the description of low frequency noise: carrier number fluctuation (∆N) theory and mobility fluctuation (∆µ) theory. In the ∆N theory, the drain current fluctuations are caused by the interfacial charges' fluctuations, which are due to the trapping and de-trapping processes of free carriers into border traps and localized states.\nBased on ∆N theory, the normalized current noise (S ID/I\n2 ds)\nin the ohmic region is a function of 1/(Vgs − Vth)\n2. In contrast to ∆N theory, according to Hooge's ∆µ theory ,\n1/f noise may originate from noise in lattice scattering, which in turn results to random mobility fluctuation. Based on ∆µ theory, the normalized current noise in the ohmic region is a function of 1/(Vgs − Vth) , .\nTo examine the main mechanism of LFN in the above threshold region, the dependence of S ID/I\n2 ds on Vgs − Vth are\n![3_image_0.png](3_image_0.png) \nextracted at Vds=0.5 V and f=10 Hz. As plotted in Fig. 7, the extracted power law coefficients of log(S ID/I\n2 ds) versus log(Vgs − Vth) are in the range of -1.03 and -1.84. Thus, the long channel devices are dominated by ∆µ theory and the short channel devices are dominated by ∆N theory.\nAs shown in Fig. 7, the slope of S I/I\n2 d against Vgs − Vth varied from -1.03 to -1.84, which may due to the variation of the origin of LFN –. In the long channel devices, the presence of clusters and localized states may push the bulk effect noise to be the predominant origin of the whole noise, and the mobility fluctuation is the main mechanism. However, with decreasing channel length, the quality of the interface between insulator/channel is critical. Thus, the fluctuation induced by trapping/emission of free carriers near the oxide/channel interface becomes more important . Therefore, ITO-stabilized ZnO TFTs varied from bulk dominated devices to interface dominated devices with the decrement of channel length, and it may result to the variation of the slope of S I/I\n2 d against Vgs − Vth.\nAs discussed above, the slopes of S ID/I\n2 ds against Vgs − Vth of our devices are between -1 and -2, thus LFN can be simulated by using carrier number with correlated mobility fluctuations (∆N-∆µ) model –. Based on ∆N-∆µ model, the interfacial charges fluctuation results to a supplementary change of the mobility, and then induces an extra drain current fluctuation. Thus, S ID/I\n2 ds can be calculated by –\n$$\\frac{S_{ID}}{I_{ds}^{2}}=\\left(1\\pm\\alpha_{c}\\mu_{eff}C_{ox}I_{ds}/g_{m}\\right)\\left(\\frac{g_{m}}{I_{ds}}\\right)^{2}\\cdot S_{vfb}\\tag{1}$$\nwhere αc is a fitting parameter relate to the coulomb scattering.\nA low value of αc means less sensitivity of the mobility to the insulator charge , . S *v f b* is the flat-band voltage noise power spectral density which can be expressed by \n$$S_{v f b}=\\frac{q^{2}K T\\lambda N_{t}}{W L C_{a x}^{2}f^{\\gamma}}$$\nwhere λ is the tunneling attenuation coefficient, which is about 0.1 nm for SiO2. Ntis the trap density near the SiO2/channel interface. \n![3_image_1.png](3_image_1.png) \nAs proposed by Ghibaudo and Boutchacha , , the gate voltage noise spectral density (S vg) in the linear region can be expressed by:\n$$S_{v_{\\rm g}}=\\frac{S_{ID}}{g_{m}^{2}}=S_{vfb}\\left[1\\pm\\alpha_{c}\\mu_{eff}C_{ox}\\left(V_{gs}-V_{th}\\right)\\right]^{2}\\tag{3}$$\nVariations of S vg with Vgs−Vth in ITO-stabilized ZnO TFTs are plotted in Fig. 8. In the above threshold region, S vg are varying superlinear with Vgs − Vth. In addition, the variation slopes of S vg with Vgs − Vth are dependent on the channel length , . Thus, the variation rate may increase with decreasing channel length. Similar phenomena are also been observed in MOSFETs ,  and poly-Si TFTs .\nIn order to find the value of αc and S *v f b* in the Eq. (3),\nfollows the extraction method proposed by Boutchacha ,\n1/2 vg as a function of Vgs − Vth are plotted in Fig. 9. In the above threshold region, S\n1/2 vg changes linearly with Vgs − Vth. Based on Eq. (3) and Fig. 9, the extracted the Electron Devices Society\n![4_image_0.png](4_image_0.png) \nS *V f b* are about 1.15 × 10−8 V\n2/Hz (L=100 µm), 2.2 × 10−8 V\n2/Hz (L=50 µm),4.5 × 10−8 V\n2/Hz (L=25 µm), 7.5 × 10−8 V\n2/Hz (L=10 µm), 1.4 × 10−7 V\n2/Hz (L=5 µm), respectively.\nThe value of S *v f b* approximately linear increases with the decrement of channel length, which is similar to the prediction of Eq. (2). Moreover, based on Eq. (2), the calculated Nt of our devices are in the range of 2.79 × 1018cm−3eV−1to 4.58 × 1018cm−3eV−1.\nAccording to Eq. (3), the scattering parameters αc can be extracted from the slopes of S\n1/2 vg -Vgs −Vth curves in the above threshold region, and their values are in the range of 1.37×106 and 5.54 × 106 V s/C. As discussed above, the dominant mechanism of noise may vary from mobility fluctuation to carrier number fluctuation, and αc should be decreased with decreasing channel length. However, the extracted values of αc from Fig. 9 are inconsistent with these predictions which may cause by the effect of contact resistance. At higher current intensities, contact resistance play an important role both in conduction and noise characteristics, especially in short channel devices. Therefore, the extracted αc from Fig. 9 are dependent on contact resistance rather than channel resistance.\nThis phenomenon is more significant in short channel devices and induce to the increment of αc with decreasing channel length. A more correct value of αc should be extracted in lower gate voltages with lower current intensities. Thence, the value of αc used in following calculations is assumed to be 0.\nThe normalized drain current noises versus drain current in ITO-stabilized ZnO TFTs are shown in Fig. 10. By using of\n∆N-∆µ model, the measured noise can be simulated, as shown by dash lines in Fig. 10. The simulated results are in good agreements with the measured noise under low drain current intensities. However, under higher drain current intensities, discrepancies occur between measured results and simulated results, which may cause by the contact resistance noise.\nThe channel and contact are both contribute to LFN. Thus, the total noises include channel noise and contact noise ,\n, . As reported , , , the measured noises are dominated by the channel under low current intensities and dominated by the contact under high current intensities.\nBy consider of contact resistance, the noise can be expressed by , , \n$$\\frac{S_{ID,R}}{I_{ds}^{2}}=\\frac{S_{ID}}{I_{ds}^{2}}+\\left(\\frac{I_{ds}}{V_{ds}}\\right)^{2}\\frac{S_{Rsd}}{R_{sd}^{2}}R_{sd}^{2}\\tag{4}$$\n2 sd is the normalized noise of contact resistance. By using of Eq. (4), the measured noise can be well approximated under high currents, as shown by solid lines in Fig. 10.\nAs shown in Fig. 10, the total resistance and related noise are determined by the contact resistance under high current intensities, therefore the total resistance can be approximated by:S ID,R\n$$\\frac{S_{I D,R}}{I_{d s}^{2}}\\approx\\frac{S_{R s d}}{R_{s d}^{2}}\\propto(V_{g s}-V_{t h})^{0}$$\nBased on Eq. (5), under high current and high gate voltages, the normalized noise is unsensitive to the gate voltages, therefore the slope of normalized noise versus gate voltages is nearly zero, as shown in Fig. 7.\nMoreover, the contact noise can be simulated by an empirical model , \n$$S_{R s d}/R_{s d}^{2}=\\alpha_{H}/W L f N\\propto1/I_{d x}\\propto L$$\nsd = αH/*WL f N* ∝ 1/Ids ∝ L (6)\nBased on Eq. (6), S Rsd/R\n2 sd may decrease with the decrement of channel length, which is consistent with the extraction results in the long channel devices (L>10 µm), as shown in Table I. Similar results have also been observed in OTFTs  and Poly-Si TFTs .\nDimension scaling effects on I-V and low frequency noise in ITO-stabilized ZnO TFTs are investigated. The dependence of threshold voltage and field effect mobility on channel length are studied. The carrier diffusion from source/drain to the channel may induce to the negative shift of threshold voltage, and the presence of series contact resistance may result to the degradation of field effect mobility. Moreover, measured noises follow a 1/ f γtype spectrum. The measured noises indicate that LFN are well interpreted by carrier number with correlated mobility fluctuations model added with access resistance fluctuation at higher current intensities."

Such improvement correlates well with the reduced incorporation of hydrogen in the fluorinated channels, as revealed by secondary ion-mass spectrometry. Fluorinated IGZO TFTs are better suited for integration with hydrogen-containing devices, such as photo-diodes based on amorphous hydrogenated silicon and TFTs based on low-temperature polycrystalline silicon. \nIndium-gallium-zinc oxide; hydrogen; fluorination; integration; thinfilm transistors.\n1. **Introduction** \nHydrogen (H) in an amorphous metal-oxide semiconductor, such as indium-gallium-zinc oxide (IGZO), usually behaves as a shallow donor . While it can be utilized to form the conductive source/drain (S/D) regions in an IGZO thin-film transistor (TFT) , its presence in the channel region often results in a negative shift in the turn-on voltage or electrical shorting of the channel . Therefore, the presence and the distribution of H in such TFT must be carefully controlled. In various applications, the presence of H is inevitable in the integrated processing of the IGZO TFTs and other device components. There are recent efforts to monolithically combine IGZO TFTs with photodiodes based on amorphous hydrogenated silicon (a-Si:H) for fingerprint sensing applications  and TFTs based on low-temperature polycrystalline silicon (LTPS) for low refresh-rate display applications . Since a large amount of H is introduced when forming the a-Si:H photo-diodes or passivating the LTPS TFTs, the feasibility of such integration schemes demands a resolution of the issue of H crosscontamination during the processing.\nIt has been reported that IGZO thin film when fluorinated by exposure to a fluorine (F)-containing plasma can result in the formation of fluorinated IGZO, i.e. IGZO:F . TFTs fabricated with IGZO:F have been shown to exhibit significantly improved reliability against electrical, thermal and illumination stress . In this work, a silanebased process for the plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition \n(PECVD) of a silicon oxide layer and a thick a-Si:H layer have been employed to simulate the H-rich environment to which a TFT would be exposed during the fabrication of photo-diodes based on a-Si:H . Besides the reported passivation by fluorination of the oxygen (O) related defects , it is shown presently that IGZO:F obtained using the reported optimal fluorination time of 10 minutes  also exhibits significantly improved intrinsic resistance against the incorporation of H. Compositional depth profiling using secondary-ion-mass spectrometry (SIMS) reveals that the H content in the IGZO is reduced by a fluorination treatment. This improves the control of the inevitable presence and distribution of H in a TFT. \n2. **Experimental**\nBottom-gate IGZO TFTs were fabricated on an oxidized silicon wafer as the substrate. A 100-nm-thick molybdenum (Mo) layer was sputtered and patterned as the bottom gate electrode. The gate dielectric stack, consisting of 50 nm silicon nitride and 75 nm silicon oxide (SiOx), was deposited at 300°C in a PECVD reactor. A 25-nmthick IGZO active layer was subsequently deposited at room temperature by radio-frequency magnetron sputtering using an IGZO target (In2O3:Ga2O3:ZnO = 1:1:1) in an the atmosphere of 10% O2 and 90% argon at a total pressure of 3 mTorr. A group of the samples was then treated with a tetrafluorocarbon (CF4) plasma for 10 minutes with a power of 30 W in the same PECVD chamber to fluorinate the IGZO thin film, thus forming an IGZO:F active layer; samples not fluorinated retained pristine IGZO as the active layer. The active islands, patterned using dilute hydrofluoric acid, were then covered with a passivation layer of 300-nm-thick SiOx deposited using the same process as that for the gate dielectric. The contact holes were opened in an inductively coupled plasma etcher using a sulfur hexafluoride etchant. A sputtered stack of 50-nm Mo and 300-nm aluminum bilayer was patterned to form the S/D electrodes. Finally, the devices were annealed at 400°C in O2 for 2 hrs. This resulted in the formation of donor-defects, thus also the activation of the conductive S/D regions under the gas-impermeable S/D metal electrodes. Simultaneously, O2 diffused across the permeable SiOx layer to passivate the donor-defects, thus reducing the intrinsic conductivity of the channel region . \nH was introduced either by additionally depositing on the TFTs a 100nm-thick PECVD-SiOx layer at 300°C or a 500-nm-thick a-Si:H layer by PECVD using silane and H2 as precursors at 200°C. The thin film stacks were characterized using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to determine the chemical states and composition of the constituent elements and SIMS depth profiling to determine the spatial distribution of the elements. The electrical characteristics of the TFTs were measured using an Agilent 4156C Semiconductor Parameter Analyzer. \n3. **Results And Discussion**\nExposure to H is unavoidable in many micro-fabrication processes. A good example is the PECVD of thin films using hydrogen-containing precursors. Presently investigated is the PECVD of SiOx. The characteristics of the TFTs before and after exposure to H are compared. Shown in Figure 1 are the transfer characteristics, i.e. the dependence of the normalized drain current () on the gate-to-source voltage ( ), of IGZO and IGZO:F TFTs before and after the exposure to H during the PECVD of SiOx (Figs. 1a and 1b).  ≡\nlength. The drain-to-source voltage ( V ds ) was fixed at 0.1 V during the measurement.\nBefore the H exposure, a turn-on voltage ( Von ) of − 0.5 V is obtained for the IGZO TFTs, where Von is defined as Vgs needed to induce an Ids of 1 pA during a forward sweep. The pseudo-subthreshold slope and the field-effect mobility ( PFE ) are, respectively, ~356 mV/dec and ~6.9 cm 2 /Vs. The initial characteristics of the corresponding IGZO:F TFTs show a slightly more positive Von of O V and a smaller µ FE of ~6. 2 cm 2 /Vs, consistent with the reported behavior resulting from the incorporation of F in IGZO .\nAfter the H exposure, the effects of H incorporation in the TFT channel regions are immediately obvious. The IGZO TFTs exhibit a large negative Von of -3.6 V (Fig. 1a: +PECVD-SiOx). The improved resistance of the IGZO:F TFTs against the same exposure to H is demonstrated in Figures 1b, with Von shifting negatively from 0 to\n− 0. 5 V (Fig. 1b: +PECVD-SiO x ). The shifts are significantly suppressed compared to those of the IGZO TFTs.\nStacks consisting of 50-nm-thick PECVD SiOx on 20-nm-thick IGZO\nor IGZO:F were prepared to mimic the H exposure of the channel region of a TFT. All stacks were annealed at 400°C for 2 hrs in O 2 after the deposition of the 50-nm SiOx layer. The effects of fluorination on the oxygen-related defect populations were compared by measuring the O1 s signal in the XPS spectra shown in Figure 2.\nDistinguished Student Paper\nThe O1 s spectrum is resolved into two Gaussian-Lorenz components, marked as O 1 and O 11 with respective peak locations of ~530.8 eV and\n~531.6 eV. O 1 is associated with the O 2 - ions in a fully coordinated polyhedron around a metal cation in IGZO, while O n is typically attributed to the oxygen-related defects  in under-coordinated polyhedra. When normalized by the total area of the spectrum, the percentage area of O 11 is commonly used as an indicator of the defectpopulation in the samples. As reported previously , the defectpopulation in IGZO:F (14.7%) is less than that in IGZO (17.0%). This difference may be partially responsible for the difference between the electrical behavior shown in Figures 1a and 1b.\nThe SIMS depth profiles of Ga, Si, H, and F were obtained across the same film stacks and shown in Figure 3. The dashed and solid lines represent those built with IGZO and IGZO:F, respectively. The top and bottom interfaces of the IGZO or IGZO:F are delineated by the rapid transitions in the intensities of Ga and Si. The F content is uniformly distributed across the IGZO:F layer after the annealing process, while the two orders of magnitude lower F signal in IGZO most likely resulted from H 3 O + , which has an ionic mass similar to the atomic mass of F. It is clear that the H content in the stacks built with IGZO is higher than that in the stacks built with IGZO:F. This is a direct evidence of the increased resistance of IGZO:F against the incorporation of H.\nthere but an any off as  no yandel shifted you're visitis visitis and ed EUREL gibs/2001/01/PR\nDistinguished Student Paper **24-2 / S. Wang**\nSubsequently, a 500-nm-thick a-Si:H deposition was employed to \nsimulate the H-rich environment to which an IGZO TFT would be exposed during the fabrication of an a-Si:H based photo-diode. Prior to the PECVD of a-Si:H, a 40-nm-thick aluminum oxide (Al2O3) barrier layer was formed by thermal atomic layer deposition (ALD) at 300C using H-containing water (H2O) and trimethylaluminum \n(TMA) as the precursors . The barrier layer limited the migration of external H to the channel region of a TFT, thus further reducing the H-induced degradation effects. The resulting transfer characteristics are shown in Figure 4.\nFigure 4. The transfer characteristics of (a) IGZO and (b) IGZO:F TFT (as-fabricated): directly subjected to H exposure (+a-Si:H); or covered by a 40-nm-thick ALD-Al2O3 and subsequently subjected to H exposure (+ALD+a-Si:H). \nCompared to the IGZO TFTs without the 40-nm-thick Al2O3 barrier layer with  ൏ െ V (+a-Si:H), a significantly suppressed negative shift in  of െ3.4 V (+ALD+a-Si:H) revealed the effectiveness of the barrier layer (Fig. 4a) against H diffusion. The \n\"residual\" negative shift in ୭୬ from െ0.5 to െ3.4 V might be caused by the incorporation of H contributed by the TMA and H2O precursors \n. The hysteresis associated with the forward and reverse ୱ sweep increased with H incorporation, most likely due to a larger population of H- or OH- induced electric dipoles . The IGZO:F TFTs exhibit an improved resistance (Fig. 4b) against the H- or process- induced degradation. After the 500-nm-thick a-Si:H \ndeposition, the small negative shift in  from 0 V (as-fabricated) to \nെ5.4 V(+a-Si:H) for the TFT without the barrier layer and to െ0.5V (+ALD+a-Si:H) for the TFT with the barrier layer demonstrates the potential for the integration of IGZO:F TFTs with hydrogencontaining devices.\n4. **Conclusion** \nA bottom-gate IGZO TFT with a fluorinated channel is demonstrated to have improved resistance against hydrogen-induced degradation. Experiments were designed by introducing H through the PECVD of SiOx or a-Si:H. Instead of the device shorting observed in the reference IGZO TFTs, the fluorinated IGZO:F TFTs showed improved performance with stronger resistance against H-induced degradation effects. As revealed using XPS and SIMS, a lower oxygen-related defect population and a lower H content were found in IGZO:F. Further assisted by the inclusion of a H-diffusion barrier layer formed by thermal ALD of Al2O3, IGZO:F TFT demonstrated a higher potential for its integration with hydrogen-containing devices, such as a-Si:H based photo-sensors or LTPS TFTs, for advanced backplane applications. \n5. **Acknowledgment**\n(NFF) of the HKUST.

        "text": "Intrinsic Dx **Centers In Ternary Chalcopyrite Semiconductors**\nStephan Lany and Alex Zunger National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, Colorado 80401, USA\n(Received 16 August 2007; published 3 January 2008)\nIn III-V and II-VI semiconductors, certain nominally electron-donating impurities do not release electrons but instead form deep electron-traps known as ''DX centers.'' While in these compounds, such traps occur only after the introduction of foreign impurity atoms, we find from first-principles calculations that in ternary I-III-VI2 chalcopyrites like CuInSe2 and CuGaSe2, DX-like centers can develop without the presence of any extrinsic impurities. These intrinsic DX centers are suggested as a cause of the difficulties to maintain high efficiencies in CuInSe2-based thin-film solar-cells when the band gap is increased by addition of Ga.\ni.e., a strongly localized electronic state within the band gap, due to a large lattice relaxation off the lattice site.\nSuch DX centers are formed by, e.g., Te or Si in AlGaAs , O in GaN (under pressure) , or Ga in ZnSe ,\nand cause trapping of free electrons, thereby pinning the Fermi level below the conduction band minimum (CBM).\nIn these III-V or II-V semiconductors, the elimination of free electrons due to DX center formation occurs due to the introduction of *extrinsic* impurities. Here, we predict theoretically that in ternary I-III-VI2 chalcopyrites semiconductors, such as CuInSe2 and CuGaSe2, free-electron elimination can occur due to *intrinsic* DX-like centers, i.e., without the introduction of any foreign impurity atoms. Thus, multinary semiconductors containing cation species of different valency, such as Cu(I) and Ga(III) in CuGaSe2, generally possess additional channels of selfcompensation, Fermi level pinning, and of carrier trapping.\nIn CuInSe2-CuGaSe2 alloys, which presently provide the most efficient absorber materials in polycrystalline thin film solar cells , these detrimental effects induced by the intrinsic DX centers can limit solar cell efficiencies.\nThe additional configurational degree of freedom available in ternary I-III-VI2 chalcopyrites due to the presence of two cation sublattices enables a number of interesting physical effects: (i) Intrinsic n-type conductivity in CuInSe2 [6–8] caused by In-on-Cu (InCu) antisite donors, and intrinsic p-type conductivity in CuInSe2 and CuGaSe2 due to Cu-vacancies VCu , (ii) the occurrence of ordered defect arrays due to stacking of (InCu-2VCu) \ndefect pairs, which explain the known nonstoichiometric phases and the self-passivation behavior, (iii) the existence of hole-barriers at grain boundaries , and (iv) the formation of strong metal-metal dimer bonds between the neighbor atoms of anion vacancies . We show here that by capturing two electrons, the ionized *intrinsic* In2-Cu and Ga2-Cu donors in CuInSe2 and CuGaSe2 can transform into a lattice-relaxed, deep DX-like state, which is effectively formed as a Frenkel-pair comprising an In or Ga interstitial and a Cu vacancy. By systematically comparing these I-III-VI2 compounds with their II-VI counterparts ZnSe and ZnO we find that, on an absolute energy scale, Fermi level pinning due to DX center formation occurs already at lower Fermi levels in the chalcopyrites compared to the IIVI compounds. As a consequence, the pinning energy occurs inside the band gap of the photovoltaic absorber in ZnO=CdS=CuIn; GaSe2 solar cell devices , thereby setting a limit to the open-cirucit voltage. Since we further find that the capability of InCu and GaCu to trap electrons into a deep DX state persists even in their complexes with VCu, which are known to be abundant , our predicted DX-behavior constitutes a previously unrecognized channel for the efficiency limitation that is encountered in CuIn1xGaxSe2 based solar cells when the band gap is increased above 1:2 eV, i.e., for x * 0:3.\nMethods.—We calculate supercell (64 atoms) total energies in the pseudopotential-momentum-space formalism as implemented in the VASP code , and use the local density approximation (LDA) to density functional theory\n(DFT). The defect formation energy *HD;q*EF of a defect D in charge state q is calculated as a function of EF\naccording to Ref. . In particular, the underestimated LDA band gap was corrected by a downward shift of EV\n(VBM) as determined by the LDA - U method , and the remaining difference with the experimental gap was accommodated by a shift of EC (CBM). Image charge corrections are calculated according to Ref. .\nThe Frenkel-pair character of the DX *center.—* The DX\ncenter in II-VI semiconductors like ZnSe:Ga is formed by a displacement of the group-III donor GaZn along the 1- 1- 1direction towards the interstitial site that is tetrahedrally coordinated by cations . Thus, the DX center resembles a Frenkel-like interstitial-vacancy pair. Since we find here that the intrinsic defects GaCu in CuGaSe2 and InCu in CuInSe2 form a DX-like state with an analogous atomic configuration, we now compare systematically the DX centers in ZnSe and CuGaSe2. (Note that ZnSe and CuGaSe2 are closely related in that Zn is the ''chemical average'' of Cu and Ga.) In both cases, the DX center is effectively formed as a Frenkel pair (Fig. 1), i.e., Ga-Zn - 2e !\nGaDX  Ga-i -V2 Zn  in ZnSe, and Ga2-Cu - 2e ! Ga0DX \nGa-i -VCu in CuGaSe2.\nIn the case of the singly charged Ga-interstitial Ga-i in ZnSe [Figs. 1(a) and 1(d)], having Td point group symmetry, the Ga4s–Se4p atomic-orbital interaction of Gai with the octahedrally coordinated Se anions leads to the formation of two singly degenerate a1 symmetric levels, i.e., a hyperdeep (HD) bonding state at \"HD  EV \n5:7 eV [see Fig. 1(a)], and the doubly occupied gap state of the interstitial (IS) at \"IS  EV - 0:6 eV [Figs. 1(a) and 1(d)], which is the antibonding state. Notice the sphereand lobelike features around Ga and Se atoms, respectively, of the IS state [Fig. 1(d)], illustrating the atomic Gas–Sep interaction that leads to the \"HD-\"IS level splitting. The Ga-DX center in ZnSe [Figs. 1(b) and 1(e)] is now formed by combining the positively charged Ga-i\n(level \"IS) with a doubly-negative Zn vacancy V2 Zn , resulting in the singly-negative GaDX, which has a doubly occupied gap level at \"DX  EV - 1:2 eV. Originating from\n\"IS, the state \"DX is only modestly perturbed by the nearby presence of VZn (which lowers the point group symmetry of Gai to C3v), and largely retains the orbital-shape and energy of the IS state \"IS [Figs. 1(b) and 1(e)]. In the chalcopyrite CuGaSe2, the intrinsic DX center [Figs. 1(c)\nand 1(f)] is formed by combining a positively charged Ga-i with a singly negatively charged Cu vacancy VCu, creating the doubly occupied DX level at \"DX  EV - 0:5 eV\n[Fig. 1(c)]. Here, the Ga0DX state is *charge-neutral*, in contrast to the generally *negative* charge state of the extrinsic DX centers in II-VI and III-V compounds . When the doubly occupied DX level \"DX [Figs. 1(b) and 1(c)] is emptied either by electron emission or by recombination with free holes, GaDX transforms into the substitutional donor Ga-Zn or Ga2-Cu (i.e., the Frenkel pairs recombine),\nwhose single-particle levels are resonant inside the conduction band . This deep-to-shallow transformation is the origin of the typical persistent photoconductivity effects in DX systems .\nAlignment of the DX *center single-particle energies.—*\nIn order to reveal the trend in the single-particle energies\n\"DX of the DX center state [Figs. 1(b) and 1(c)], on an absolute energy scale, we placed the respective energies in a band-offset diagram, shown in Fig. 2. (The band offsets were obtained by adding the LDA - U corrections for EV\n to the LDA-calculated valence band offsets of Ref. ). Figure 2 shows that \"DX clearly aligns on an absolute scale among ZnSe, CuGaSe2, and CuInSe2. In ZnO, we find that the energy level of the *unrelaxed* Gai-VZn pair aligns approximately with the energy\n\"DX in the other materials, being close to the CBM of ZnO. However, this configuration is not stable in ZnO,\nand transforms spontaneously into the substitutional Ga-Zn donor configuration, emitting two electrons to the CBM. Thus, we find that the Ga DX center does not exist in ZnO, and does not limit n-type doping by Ga donors.\nFermi level pinning energies.—The DX phenomenology occurs when electrons are introduced through doping, formation of a n-p junction, or photoexcitation, leading to a rise of the Fermi level EF  in the gap. We calculate, as a function of EF, the formation energies of the substitutional ionized donor (e.g., In2-Cu ) and the deep DX state (e.g.,\nIn0DX) in their relaxed configurations. We define the critical value Epin DX as the Fermi level where the DX state becomes thermodynamically more stable than the substitutional ionized donor, i.e., HIn0DX \t HIn2-Cu  for EF  Epin DX. At this point, the trapping of free electrons into the deep DX\nstate leads to pinning of the Fermi level at Epin DX. As shown in Fig. 2, the calculated pinning level Epin DX  EC  0:6 eV\nlies inside the gap of ZnSe, indicating that the DX center is the ground state of GaZn dopants in n-type ZnSe, in accord with experiment . Also in CuGaSe2, Epin DX \nEC  0:8 eV lies well inside the gap, indicating that the GaCu double donors are deep and do not produce free electrons. Only in CuInSe2, which has a relatively small band gap (Eg  1:0 eV), Epin DX  EC  0:1 eV is sufficiently close to the CBM to allow for free-electron densities in the 1016 cm3 range , before the electron trapping into the deep DX level occurs. Comparing the pinning levels Epin DX in ZnSe, CuGasSe2, and CuInSe2 on an absolute energy scale (Fig. 2), we see that Epin DX lies considerably lower in energy in the chalcopyrites compared to ZnSe. This observation is surprising at first, because the\nFIG. 1 (color online). The Ga-site local density of states (LDOS) with respect to EV (in eV) for the Ga-interstitial in ZnSe, showing the hyper-deep state\n\"HD and the gap level \"IS of Ga-i , and for the DX centers GaDX in ZnSe and Ga0DX\nin CuGaSe2, showing the deep \"DX gap level. (d)–(f) The isosurface (green) of the wave function square for the \"IS and\n\"DX levels, depicting the respective electron orbits. The Frenkel-pair character of the DX centers is apparent in the atomic structure of GaDX  Ga-i  V2 Zn  in ZnSe (e), and in that of Ga0DX  Ga-i VCu in CuGaSe2 (f).\nDX center *single-particle* energies \"DX are well aligned\n(Fig. 2). Considering, however, the Frenkel-pair character of the DX center, we find that this difference results from the much lower formation energy of the cation-vacancy partner of the Frenkel pair in the chalcopyrites: For example, we find HV2 Zn   4:3 eV in ZnSe (under metalrich conditions and for EF  EV), compared to only HVCu  0:6 eV and HVCu  0:9 eV in CuGaSe2 and CuInSe2, respectively.\nWhile the spontaneous formation of VCu acceptors has been identified before as a cause of Fermi level pinning at Epin VCu  EV - 0:9 eV in CuInSe2 and at EV - 0:6 eV\nCuGaSe2 , the DX center can pin the Fermi level, simply by a change of the atomic configuration without the formation of new lattice defects. Thus, electron trapping into deep DX states can occur at room temperature, e.g.,\nwhen free electrons are produced by photo-excitation during solar cell operation, whereas the spontaneous formation of charged Cu-vacancies generally occurs during crystal growth at higher temperatures.\nDX *behavior of antisite-vacancy defect pairs.—*When the Fermi level EF lies within 1 eV from the VBM, as is the case in naturally p-type CuInSe2 and CuGaSe2 bulk or thin-film semiconductors , the mutual passivation between In2-Cu or Ga2-Cu donors and VCu acceptors leads to electrically inactive, *charge-neutral* complexes, e.g.,\nIn2-Cu -2VCu 0 . We find here that when EF rises higher in the gap, the capture of electrons into the deep DX level of InCu or GaCu leads the formation of *negatively charged* complexes, e.g., InCu-2VCu 0 - 2e ! InDX-2VCu 2.\nSince, compared to the isolated donors, the respective pinning levels of such complexes (Table I) are shifted only slightly towards higher energies, the (InCu-2VCu) defect pairs will affect solar cells in essentially the same way as isolated InCu. This finding is significant, since the formation of large quantities of isolated InCu and isolated VCu during crystal growth occurs very close to a 1:2 ratio , so that most InCu will eventually exist as (InCu-2VCu) pairs, whereas the amount of uncompensated isolated InCu donors stays below 1018 cm3 .\n| Transition   | CuInSe2   | CuGaSe2    |\n|--------------|-----------|------------|\n| M2 Cu =M0 DX              | EV  0:921:07           | 0.84(1.04) |\n| =MDX-VCu               | EV  1:111:11           | 1.02(1.02) |\n| MCu-VCu MCu-2VCu 0=MDX-2VCu 2              | EV  1:301:15           | 1.36(1.16) |\nConfiguration coordinate diagram of the intrinsic DX\ncenter.—In order to compare below the properties of the intrinsic DX center to experiment, we calculated the configuration coordinate diagram for the InCu donor in CuInSe2 (Fig. 3): The neutral substitutional donor In0Cu\n(Fig. 3, left), has its single-particle level resonant inside the conduction band , and releases the electrons into a shallow, conduction-band-like perturbed-host state (PHS) just below the CBM, which produces free electrons, i.e.,\nIn0Cu ! In2-Cu - 2e. In the deep DX configuration In0DX\n(Fig. 3, right), which is the ground state for EF > Epin DX\n(Table I), two electrons occupy the deep, defect-localized state (DLS) \"DX in the gap (see Ref.  for a discussion of different defect behaviors creating either a PHS or a DLS\nin the gap). The transition from the deep DX state into the shallow substitutional configuration can proceed in three ways (see Fig. 3): (i) Through optical recombination with free holes In0DX - h ! In-DX, and subsequent lattice relaxation of In-DX to the substitutional configuration. The optical transition is calculated from total-energies  at EPL \n0:25 eV (since, Koopman's theorem does not apply in DFT, EPL differs from the single-particle energy difference\n\"DX  EV in Fig. 2). Because of the small energy EPL, the DX center will appear essentially as a nonradiative recombination center in most experiments. (ii) Through the optical absorption In0DX ! In-DX - e, and subsequent relaxation (Eabs  0:81 eV). (iii) Through the activation of a structural energy barrier activation plus simultaneous electron emission to the CBM (Eact 0:32 eV).\nEffect of the DX *center in solar cells.—* Electrical characterization of ZnO=CdS=CuIn; GaSe2 n/pheterojunction solar cells  has shown the trapping of photo-generated electrons upon illumination under reverse bias at low temperature (120 K). While the trap level must be close to the CBM, because it is initially empty at the high Fermi level above EC  0:2 eV (EV - 1:0 eV)\nclose to the n/p-junction, the trapped electrons are not emitted up to 300 K, which implies an activation energy of at least 0.6 eV . This apparently paradoxical behavior can be explained by our calculated DX transition energies (Table I) and configuration coordinate diagram: At a Fermi level above EV - 1:0 eV, i.e., EF > Epin DX (Table I),\nthe DX state is initially empty (Fig. 3, left). Photoexcitation of free electrons leads then to the filling of the trap, i.e., the electrons are captured into the deep DX state (Fig. 3, right). In the presence of free holes, the DX state is immediately emptied again due to recombination [cf. transition (i) above], explaining why the application of reverse bias, reducing the hole-concentration, was necessary in Ref.  to stabilize the trapped state. In the absence of free holes, the emptying of the electron traps occurs through activation of the barrier Eact (Fig. 3) and electron-emission [cf. transition (iii) above]. Using our transition-rate model  for activated transitions involving carrier-capture or emission, we find that electronemission would occur at 160 K for the barrier Eact 0:32 eV in CuInSe2. Because of the larger band gap of the CuIn; GaSe2 alloys used in the experiment of Ref. ,\nhowever, the barrier is larger there, and the metastable DX state persists up to 300 K.\nWhile our predicted intrinsic DX behavior should be rather benign for smaller-gap CuIn1xGaxSe2 absorbers\n(x \t 0:3; Eg & 1:2 eV), the calculated Epin DX pinning energies (Fig. 2 and Table I) show that these defect complexes could be responsible for the limitation of the open-circuit voltage VOC below 1 eV  (VOC equals the difference in EF between the two sides of the n-p-heterojunction under illumination). This is, because photoexcited electrons are trapped into the DX state and recombine with photoexcited holes when EF  approaches Epin DX. Note, that the VSe-VCu divacancy complex could be a second, independent source of VOC limitation . Thus, the control of intrinsic defects in CuIn; GaSe2 is essential for any attempt to improve solar cell efficiency through larger absorber band gaps (higher Ga content) in a single-junction cell, or through utilization of a wide-gap top cell (e.g., pure CuGaSe2) in a tandem device design.\nConclusion.—In contrast to conventional III-V or II-VI\nsystems, free-electron eliminating DX-like centers can 016401-4 develop in I-III-VI2 ternary semiconductors even in the absence of extrinsic impurities. Close to a n=p heterojunction, these centers cause Fermi level pinning and trapping of photoexcited electrons, thereby limiting the efficiency of CuIn; GaSe2 photovoltaic absorbers.\nThis work was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, DOE-EERE, under Contract No. DE-AC3699GO10337.\n D.

        "text": "Effect Of Ar / O2 Flow Ratio During Sputtering Of Inzno Active Layer On Photocurrent And Responsivity Characteristics Of Amorphous Inzno Thin Film Transistors\nChanghui Fan*, Yu Xin*, Ludong Qin*, Xiaoliang Zhou*, Shengdong Zhang*** ***\n*School of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Peking University, Shenzhen, China \n****Institute of Microelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China** \n*****Active Matrix Display Beijing Engineering Research Center, Beijing, China**\nThe photocurrent and responsivity characteristics of amorphous InZnO (a-IZO) thin film transistors (TFTs) under different Ar:O2 gas flow ratio when growing the IZO active layer by sputtering are investigated. As the Ar:O2 gas flow ratio increases, the photocurrent and responsivity increase by nearly two orders of magnitude, under the same light power density at a wavelength of 400 nm to 475 nm light illumination. \nAuthor Keywords InZnO; Thin film transistors (TFTs); Photocurrent; Responsivity. \n1. Introduction Due to the advantages of low preparation temperature, small offstate current, good uniformity over large areas; and high mobility, amorphous oxide semiconductor thin film transistors (AOS TFTs) have attracted widespread attention for their potential applications . In addition to the applications in backplane technology for driving active matrix liquid crystal display (AMLCD) and active matrix organic light emitting diode (AMOLED) display, AOS TFTs are also used as photodetector and imager due to their high photosensitivity to blue and ultraviolet (UV) light . Compared to the most commonly used amorphous InGaZnO (a-IGZO) material, amorphous InZnO (aIZO) has a narrower band gap energy Eg ~2.9 eV\f and a higher sub-gap oxygen vacancies (Vo) density states (~1020 cm-3eV-1) \n. Under illumination, the neutral Vo states in a-IZO can be ionized and release free electrons. The higher density of Vo and the narrower band gaps (~2.9 eV, corresponds to ~430 nm wavelength) mean that the a-IZO has strong absorption of blue and near-ultraviolet light, and thus high responsivity . By adjusting the gas flow ratio of Ar and O2 during the deposition of a-IZO film, the Vo density states in a-IZO film will be affected. Therefore, higher photocurrent and responsivity under the same light illumination can be achieved by optimizing the gas flow ratio. In this work, we systematically investigated the effects of gas flow ratios of Ar and O2 on the photocurrent and responsivity characteristics of a-IZO TFT devices when growing the IZO active layer by sputtering. \n2. Experiment Details\nFig. 1 shows the schematic cross section view of the fabricated inverted staggered bottom gate a-IZO TFT structure. The TFT fabrication process as follows. First, a 100 nm thick layer molybdenum (Mo) as bottom gate electrode was grown by direct current (DC) sputtering at room temperature and patterned by wet etching on the glass. Next, a 120 nm thick layer SiO2 as gate insulator (GI) was grown by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) at 300ႏ. The ratio of SiH4 and N2O \nduring SiO2 growth is 20:80 sccm. Afterwards, a 40 nm thick layer a-IZO (In:Zn=1:1) as the active channel was grown by direct current (DC) sputtering at room temperature and patterned by wet etching in a diluted HCl solution. The DC power and gas pressure on sputtering a-IZO were 100 W and 0.4 Pa. Four different Ar:O2 gas flow ratios a-IZO TFT devices when sputtering IZO film were 20:30 sccm, 25:25 sccm, 30:20 sccm and 35:15 sccm respectively. After that, a 70 nm thick layer ITO \nas the source and drain electrodes were grown by direct current \n(DC) sputtering at room temperature and patterned by lift-off. Subsequently, the SiO2 gate insulator (GI) on the bottom gate electrode was etched away by dry etching to expose the contact holes to facilitate testing. Finally, the devices were thermally annealed in O2 atmosphere at 300ႏ for 1h. \nThe photoelectric characteristics of the TFT devices were tested at room temperature in B1500 (Agilent Technologies) semiconductor parameter analyzer with an additional Xenon arc lamp source. A 300 mm focal length monochromator produces 200-1200 nm monochromatic light by filtering the incident light of the additional Xenon arc lamp. The incident monochromatic light power was measured by a high sensitivity Si photodetector (LE-LPM-10AP). The ambient humidity was controlled at 50% during the measurement. \n3. Results And Discussion\nFig. 2 shows the typical transfer characteristics of the fabricated a-IZO TFT at four different Ar:O2 gas flow ratios in the dark. The transfer characteristics were measured in a positive sweep mode with the gate voltage (Vgs) sweeping from -30 V to 30 V \nand the drain voltage (Vds) xed at 0.1 V and 10.1 V. The channel width (W) and length (L) are 100 ȝm and 20 ȝm, respectively. The a-IZO TFTs fabricated at four different Ar:O2 gas flow ratios all showed good switching characteristics in the dark. The off-state current (*Ioff*) at Vgs = -20 V is less than 10-12 A and the on/off ratio closed to 109 at Vds = 10.1 V. \nTable 1 shows the extracted major characteristics parameters of four different Ar:O2 gas flow ratios a-IZO TFT. As the Ar:O2 gas flow ratio increases, from 20:30 sccm to 35:15 sccm, the saturation mobility (ȝsat) decreased slightly, but remained basically around 17 cm2V-1s-1, the threshold voltage (Vth) drops from -1.13 V to -3.31 V, subthreshold swing (SS) deteriorated slightly, increased from 0.39 V/dec to 0.52 V/dec. When the aIZO film is sputtered, as the Ar gas flow in the chamber \nincreases, the O2 gas flow decreases, the oxygen content in the a-IZO film is reduced, the carrier concentration is increased, and the density of defect states associated with oxygen vacancies is increased. Therefore, the threshold voltage will become more negative at high Ar:O2 gas flow ratio due to higher carrier concentration. The increase in the density of oxygen vacancy defect states also makes the SS of the a-IZO TFT fabricated at a higher Ar:O2 gas flow ratio deteriorate. \n![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png) \nFigure 2.

The transmissivity \n(T) and optical absorption coefficient (Į) of the a-IZO film satisfy the following equation : \nWhere d is the thickness of the a-IZO film. According to the equation (1), the inset of Fig. 3 shows the relation between light absorption coefficient (Į) of a-IZO single film with four different Ar:O2 gas flow ratios at wavelengths ranging from 350 nm to 800 nm. \n![1_image_3.png](1_image_3.png) \nFigure 3. The transmittance spectra of a 40 nm a-IZO single film at four different Ar:O2 gas flow ratios. At the wavelength range from 350 nm to 525 nm, and as the Ar:O2 gas flow ratio increases, from 20:30 sccm to 35:15 sccm, the transmittance of the single a-IZO film is gradually smaller, and the optical absorption coefficient gradually increases, which indicates the absorption of light is gradually enhanced. The photocurrent characteristics of four different Ar:O2 gas flow ratios a-IZO TFTs devices in the dark and under the same light power density (500 ȝW/cm2) with wavelengths ranging from 525 nm to 350 nm were shown in Fig. 4 (a)-(d). The photocurrent transfer characteristics were measured in a negative sweep mode with the gate voltage (Vgs) sweeping from 30 V to -30 V and the drain voltage (Vds) xed at 10 V. As the wavelength of the incident light decreases, the photo response current in the negative biased off-state region increases dramatically. The responsivity of a-IZO TFT under light illumination can be calculated using the following equation : \n$$R={\\frac{I_{p h}-I_{d a r k}}{P_{i n c}\\times W\\times L}}$$\nWhere R is the responsivity, Iph is the extracted photo response current, *Idark* is the dark current, *Pinc* is incident light power density, W is the channel width (100 ȝm), L is the channel length (20 ȝm). \n$$({\\mathfrak{I}})$$\nFigure 4.

According to equation (3) (4) (5), \nFig. 5 (c) and Fig. 5 (d) shows the extracted EQE and *ncarrier* of the a-IZO TFT under different wavelengths of light illumination at the conditions of Vgs = -20 V and Vds = 10 V from the photocurrent transfer characteristics. As the wavelength of the incident light decreases, the Iph and Responsivity and EQE and ncarrier at the off-state region increases dramatically, and as the Ar:O2 gas flow ratio increases, the Iph and responsivity and EQE \nand *ncarrier* also increases by nearly two orders of magnitude at incident light wavelengths ranging from 475nm to 400nm under the same light power density. \n![2_image_1.png](2_image_1.png) \nFigure 5. (a) Iph, (b) responsivity, (c) EQE, (d) ncarrier of four different Ar:O2 gas flow ratios a-IZO TFT with a wavelength ranging from 525nm to 350nm. The band gap energy (Eg) of a-IZO is about 2.9 eV , corresponding to about 430 nm wavelength. In a-IZO semiconductor active layer, the sub-gap deep neutral oxygen vacancies (Vo) states density can reach the order of 1015 ~ 1020 cm-3eV-1, locate 2 eV below the conduction band minima edge \n(CBM) , as shown in Fig. 6(a). Under illumination with light wavelength less than 550 nm, due to high Vo state density, a deep neutral Vo defect state is thought to be able to absorb the energy of a photon acts as a deep donor ionizes to generate a shallow positively charged ionized oxygen vacancy (Vo2+) \ndefect state simultaneously releasing two electrons . With a voltage of -20 V (Vgs = -20 V) applied to the bottom gate, the energy band diagram of the a-IZO layer near the gate side is shown in Fig. 6(b). Under negative gate voltage, the ionized Vo2+ after absorption of photon energy and band-to-band light absorption generated holes migrate and accumulate in the front channel, and the corresponding photo-generated electrons migrate to the back channel , as shown in Fig. 6(b). \nWith a voltage of 10 V (Vds = 10 V) applied to the drain electrode, the energy band diagram of the a-IZO layer near the source side is shown in Fig. 6(c). The blue dashed line represents the a-IZO band diagram under dark conditions, due to high source to channel barrier, electrons in source cannot cross the barrier and enter the a-IZO back channel through thermionic field emission (TFE) , leading to very low current in the offstate region at Vgs = -20 V and Vds = 10 V which is also corresponding to the *Idark* (~10-13 A) result in Fig. 4 (a)-(d). The black solid line in Fig. 6(c) represents the a-IZO band diagram under illumination with Ȝ< 550 nm, at Vgs = -20 V and Vds = 10 V, the Vo2+ and band-to-band light absorption generated holes migrate and accumulate at source side, leading to source to channel barrier lowering (SBL) by ᶭĭb . Due to illumination caused SBL, electrons in source can cross the barrier enter the a-IZO back channel through TFE, and generate high photocurrent (Iph) under the drive of Vds. Under illumination with light wavelengths ranging from 525 nm to 500 nm, corresponding photon energy is 2.37 eV to 2.49 eV, sub-gap deep Vo is slightly excited, resulting in a weaker SBL effect. Therefore with the increase of the Ar:O2 gas flow ratio, the Iph increases slightly, which is close to the dark current (*Idark*), as shown in Fig. 5 (a).\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png) \nFigure 6. (a) The conceptual diagram of the density of states for IZO film. (b) The energy band diagram of the aIZO active layer near the gate side. (c) The energy band diagram of the a-IZO active layer near the source side. On the other hand, under illumination with light wavelengths ranging from 475 nm to 400 nm, corresponding photon energy is 2.62 eV to 3.11 eV, sub-gap deep Vo is strongly excited, resulting in a stronger SBL effect, generating a larger Iph. And as the light wavelength decreases, the photon energy increases, more Vo can be excited, the Iph and Responsivity and EQE and ncarrier increase dramatically as shown in Fig. 5 (a)-(d). As the Ar:O2 gas flow ratios increases, from 20:30 sccm to 35:15 sccm, the oxygen content in the a-IZO film is continuously decreasing, and the state density of Vo defect is continuously increasing. \nUnder the same light conditions of 475nm to 400nm, more Vo can be excited in high Ar:O2 gas flow ratio a-IZO film, which results in a stronger SBL effect, leading to an increase in Iph and Responsivity and EQE and *ncarrier* by nearly two orders of magnitude, as shown in Fig. 5 (a)-(d). As the wavelength decreases from 370nm to 350nm, corresponding photon energy is 3.36 eV to 3.55 eV, band to band absorption and Vo near the valence band maximum edge is strongly excited, generating a larger Iph. Since the photon energy at this time has exceeded the Eg of a-IZO, the band-to-band absorption is the main excitation process, and the excitation of Vo is the secondary excitation process. Therefore, with the increase of the Ar:O2 gas flow ratio, the increase in Iph and Responsivity and EQE and *ncarrier* caused by the increase in Vo state density is not obvious, as shown in Fig. 5 (a)-(d). \nThe photocurrent characteristics of four different Ar:O2 gas flow \nratios a-IZO TFTs devices in the dark and under the same wavelength (400 nm) with light power density ranging from 100 ȝW/cm2 to 600 ȝW/cm2 were shown in Fig. 7 (a)-(d). Under 400 nm light illumination, sub-gap deep Vo is strongly excited, resulting in a strong SBL effect, generating a large Ids, as shown in Fig. 7 (a)-(d). \nFigure 7. (a)-(d) The photo response results of a-IZO TFT devices fabricated at four different Ar:O2 gas flow ratios with light power density ranging from 100 ȝW/cm2 to 600 ȝW/cm2. \nFig. 8 (a) shows the fitting relationship between Iph and *Pinc* of four different Ar:O2 gas flow ratios a-IZO TFTs. The Iph all shows a strong proportional relationship to *Pinc*Ȗ, where Ȗ is larger than 1. The power-law relation between Iph and PincȖ\n(Ȗ >1) can be ascribed by the accumulation of photo induced positive charges near the source side caused SBL effect . \nFigure 8. (a) Iph, (b) responsivity, (c) EQE, (d) ncarrier of four different Ar:O2 gas flow ratios a-IZO TFT with light power density ranging from 100 ȝW/cm2 to 600 ȝW/cm2.\nThe responsivity calculated according to equation (2), due to the power-law relation between Iph and *Pinc*Ȗ, the responsivity and PincȖ also shows a power-law relation, where Ȗ is smaller than 1, as shown in Fig. 8 (b). With the increase in incident light power density and Ar:O2 gas flow ratios, sub-gap deep Vo defect in aIZO film can absorb more photon energy, and ionization produces more Vo2+, causing a stronger SBL effect. The positive charge Vo2+ accumulated near the source side caused the reduced source-to-channel barrier, which allows the electrons at \nthe source to enter the channel more efficiently by thermionic field emission (TEF), resulting in a larger Iph and Responsivity and EQE and *ncarrier*, as shown in Fig. 8 (a)-(d). According to equation (3) (4) (5), due to the power-law relation between Iph and *Pinc*Ȗ, the EQE and *ncarrier* between *Pinc*Ȗ also show approximately a power-law relation, as shown in Fig. 8 (c) and Fig. 8 (d). \n4. Conclusion In summary, we fabricated a-IZO TFT with different Ar:O2 gas flow ratios, and measured their photocurrent response characteristics to different wavelengths and different incident light power densities. As the incident light wavelengths decreases and power density increases, the photo response current and responsivity in the off-state region increase dramatically, and as the Ar:O2 gas flow ratio increases, Iph and Responsivity and EQE and *ncarrier* all increase by nearly two orders of magnitude.

It also influences on channel carrier concentration due to the shifting of electron quasi-Fermi energy level\n(EF).7,8If the top gate and the bottom gate electrodes are connected together, dual gate sweep operation is performed in DG a-IGZO TFTs, which exhibit higher drain current due to bulk accumulation of thin active layer (a-IGZO).9 The electrical stress under light is considered as the biggest challenge of metal oxide based TFTs. In our previous report, we observed that the negative VTH shift under negative bias illumination stress (NBIS) can be significantly reduced during dual sweeping in DG a-IGZO TFTs.10 It also observed that the constant positive bias at top gate decreases the NBIS induced negative VTH shift, which gradually increases as negative top gate bias is applied.21 The opaque metal top gate blocks the light absorption in a-IGZO and leads negligible defect generation (positive charges) as well as less VTH shift under NBIS.11 The positive bias temperature stress (PBTS) in the SG a-IGZO TFTs leads to a positive VTH shift, which increases with bias voltage and temperature.12 The origin of positive VTH shift can be explained as the negative charge (electron) trapping and/or ion migration at the bottom SiO2/a-IGZO interface can explain the results.12 On the other hand, the negative bias stress temperature stress (NBTS) in the DG a-IGZO TFTs can lead to the negative VTH shift.12 The origin of negative VTH shift has illustrated by positive charge (hole) trapping and/or defect generation at the bottom SiO2/a-IGZO interface.13 Following the advantages of dual gate a-IGZO TFT (considering high on current, lower PBS &\nNBIS effects for dual sweeping), it is important to understand the PBTS/NBTS of dual gate a-IGZO\nTFTs. In this paper, we report that top gate PBTS shows negative VTH shift and top gate NBTS\nshows positive VTH shift. This is opposite to that of conventional single gate (SG) a-IGZO TFTs.\nSuch anomalous VTH shift has been explained by the charge migration at the top SiO2/a-IGZO\ninterface. It is also found that the top gate bias stress dominates the shift both at top and bottom gate sweep, especially when the top gate stress voltage is larger than bottom gate voltage.\nDual-gate (DG) amorphous indium-gallium-zinc-oxide (a-IGZO) thin-film-transistors (TFTs)\nshown in Figure 1(a) were fabricated according to the followings: A 60nm molybdenum (Mo) layer was deposited on glass and patterned by wet etching for a bottom gate. Then, a bilayer of 100nm SiNX and 150nm SiO2 was deposited by the plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD)\nat 350◦C for bottom gate insulator. On bottom gate insulator, a 20nm a-IGZO layer was reactive sputtered and patterned by wet etching with an indium tin oxide (ITO) etchant for active island, followed by deposition of a 150nm Mo layer as source/drain electrodes. To reduce the damage to the back channel of a-IGZO layer during source/drain wet etching, a hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)\nbased etchant was used.14 A 400nm SiO2 layer was deposited as the top gate insulator by PECVD at 200◦C which acts as the passivation of a-IGZO active layer. To form the top gate, a 150nm Mo layer was deposited by sputtering and patterned by wet etching. And, a 600nm SiO2 layer was deposited as a passivation of DG a-IGZO TFTs. Finally, annealing was carried out at 250◦C in vacuum for 100 hours to have reliable device performance.15\n075217-2 Chun Et Al. Aip Advances 6, 075217 (2016) Ii. Experimental Iii. Results And Discussion\nIn the DG a-IGZO TFTs, the transfer characteristics measured at bottom gate with grounded top gate, show positive transfer shift of 0.6V, under the positive bias temperature stress (PBTS)\nfor 5000s with the stress condition of VBG = 20V and VTG = VDS = GND at 60◦C, has shown in Figure 1(b). When the constant bias at top gate is changed from 0V to -30V during stress, transfer characteristics for bottom gate sweep shifts by ∼3.5V positively (shown in Fig. 1(c)). On the other hand, with top gate bias of positive 40V, the transfer shifted negatively of ∼-1.6V. It indicates that fixed VTG during stress, plays a significant role on the transfer shift measured at bottom gate sweep. The positive VTH shifts under positive bias stress, are well understood as the negative trapping/migration of negative chages12 around the gate insulator (SiO2)/a-IGZO interface. The negative transfer shift by negative bias stress can be understood as positive charge trapping/migration/defect generation around the interfaces/active bulk. Fig 1(c) & 1(d), shows opposite trend of VTH shift depending on positive/negative top gate bias, although positive bias was applied at bottom gate during stress. As the stress condition of bottom gate bias (VBG) is changed from positive to negative (NBTS), it shows a similar trend of VTH shift for bottom gate sweep, while VTG is GND, -30V and\n+40V, as shown in Figure 1(e), 1(f) and 1(g), respectively.\nFigure 2(a) and 2(b) summarize such abnormal VTH shift after 5000s PBTS and NBTS at bottom gate with various VTG's from -30V to +40V. It shows a consistent trend, which has observed in Figure 1. The negative VTG stress leads positive ∆VTH and the positive VTG stress results in\nnegative AV TH in both bottom gate sweep and top gate sweep. At V TG = OV, negligible negative/positive transfer shift can be seen depending on negative/positive bias at bottom gate, which is quite consistent with conventional single gate TFTs. 12 As the top gate bias increases and goes higher than bottom gate voltage, the positive/negative charge trapping/ion migration both at top and bottom interfaces simultaneously dominate by top gate bias. It is not a common trend that positive bias stress makes negative transfer shift and negative bias stress makes positive transfer shift. This is possible with the existence of highly defective interface and/or existence of mobile charges inside low temperature deposited the gate insulator, also found in poly-Si TFTs. 22 Negligible transfer degradation under PBTS/NBTS at bottom gate with grounded V TG , clearly reveals the good quality of bottom interface & gate insulator.\nTo understand the top gate insulator and interface quality, we applied negative (-20V) and positive (+40V) bias temperature (60°C) stress at top gate with grounding bottom gate, as shown in Fig. 3(a) and 3(b) , respectively. After 5000s stress, the AV TH 's shifted 0.4V positively and\n-2V negatively for bottom gate sweep, whereas 2.6V positively and -3.3V, negatively for top gate sweep (not shown here). This V TH shift is reverse to the typical NBTS/PBTS results showing negative/positive shift, caused by positive/negative charge trapping at the interfaces. This experimental data clearly shows that the anomalous behavior of V TH shift in DG a-IGZO TFTs (shown in Fig. 1 )\nis associated from a-IGZO/top SiO 2 interface.\nThe defects at top interface of BCE a-IGZO can be formed during patterning the active island and source/drain electrodes. 16 If a-IGZO top surface is damaged during the wet etching, the sub-threshold swing (SS) of top gate sweep would be larger compared to that of bottom gate sweep. 17 However, the SS of the top gate sweep is quite small (0.29V/dec.) and similar to bottom gate sweep (0.21V/dec.). Thus it is difficult to summarize the defect distribution from TFT\nIn our previous investigation, X-ray reflectivity (XRR) measurement was carried out to understand the mass density of top (deposited at ~200 ° C) and bottom gate insulators deposited at\n~350 °C, which were found to be ~2.1 g.cm −3 and ~2.5 g.cm −3 , respectively. 24 In dual gate a-IGZO\nTFTs, analytical & experimental investigation indicate high density of top interface state density\n(~1.1 x 10 13 eV~ 1 cm~ 2 ) compared with bottom interface (~4.4 x 10 12 eV~ 1 cm~ 2 ). 20 It clarifies that high temperature deposited gate insulator gives better film quality/less trap density & less mobile charges at the interfaces. On the other hand, low temperature deposited gate insulator has much higher interface state density and much larger instabilities similar to a-Si:H TFT with SiN x gate insulator. 18 , 19\nThe chemical compositional changes at top and bottom interfaces, measured using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) depth profile, which was deposited under similar condition as TFT devices, shown in Figure 4(a). Figure 4(b) and 4(c) show that In (indium) concentration at top gate SiO2/a-IGZO interface is much higher than Ga (gallium) and Zn (zinc), while at the bottom gate SiO2/a-IGZO interface, In concentration is nearly the same as Ga and lower than Zn. These results support that the In diffusion into the top SiO2 during post fabrication process/annealing could be a possible reason to change the chemical composition between the top and bottom interfaces, which substantially change the film quality around interfaces.\nThe details of metal-oxygen bond and oxygen vacancy (VO) around the top and bottom interfaces can be seen by the deconvolution of O1S spectroscopy shown in Figure 4(d), 4(e), 4(f) and 4(g)\ncorresponding to the O1s spectroscopy at position P1 (top gate insulator), P2(IGZO top interface), P3 (IGZO bottom interface) and P4(bottom gate insulator), respectively. At P1 and P4, Si-O bond and oxygen vacancy (VO) show similar O1S spectra because of similar chemical composition of SiO2. However, there is big difference of O1S spectra in P2 and P3, because IGZO is sensitive to deposition process, especially at the interfaces. The peak intensity of O1S spectra can be deconvoluted into Si-O, M-O, VO and OH bonds. The intensities of Si-O and O-H bonds at the top interface is particularly higher than the bottom interface with slightly higher VO intensity. This is due to more defective top interface than bottom interface, which might be affected during PECVD SiO2 process above the active layer/ poor property of low temperature deposited top gate insulator compared with bottom gate SiO2 layer. Therefore, inter-mixing between Si-O and M-O can be seen at the top interface and thus enhance hydrogen diffusion to active layer as can be seen as larger O-H bonds in P2.\nThe defective top gate interfaces and mobile charges inside gate insulator/around top interface has been considered to explain the anomalous behavior of VTH shift under PBTS/NBTS. Low temperature deposited gate insulator can contain water related mobile ions (H+/OH−).22 Our XPS\ninspection also shows Indium atom diffusion and high OH concentration at the top interfaces as shown in Fig. 4. The VTH shift as a function of stress time for bias-stress of VBG = 20V and VTG = -30V, shown in Fig. 5(a), indicating that the positive VTH shift increases both in bottom gate sweep and in top gate sweep. The origin of such VTH shift has explained using the schematic band diagram shown in Figure 5(b). With grounded top gate, the PBTS at bottom gate shifted positively due to electron trapping at bottom SiO2/a-IGZO interfaces. When negative top gate bias is\nthe defective interfaces as discussed before. It may not easy to confirm the migration of negative charges under stress. Rha et al. reported that OH (hydroxyl) spices around a-IGZO back interface and passivation layer in bottom gate inverted staggered a-IGZO TFTs can play a role of negative charges and can form OH−.\n23 We suspect these negative charges can form a metastable states, which makes a positive transfer shift of top sweep under negative bias stress (in fig. 5(a)). When the top gate bias amplitude is larger than bottom gate, top gate induced charges during stress may effect on bottom gate sweep. The top gate bias is changed from negative to positive 30V (shown in Fig. 5(c)), the VTH shifted negatively top/bottom sweep after 5000s stress. Schematic band diagram of figure 5(d) shows that the positive VBG induces the electron trapping (negligible) at bottom SiO2 interface, whereas the positive VTG induce some positive mobile charges In+around top interfaces, thus negative VTH is observed. Since VTG > VBG and a-IGZO film is thin, it influence both on top and bottom sweep simultaneously.\nTo clarify the bottom/top gate gate induce electric field effects during stress, we applied VBG = VTG = -20V during stress shown in Figure 5(e). The VTH shift (< 0.5V) is negative for bottom gate sweep whereas positive for top gate sweep, that means equal electric field influence on top and bottom interfaces separately. Negative VBG induces negligible hole/positive charge trapping at the bottom SiO2 interface due to the lack of p-type a-IGZO, which influences the small negative VTH shift in bottom gate sweep.20 On the other hand, the negative VTG can induce the negative mobile charges (OH−) around the top SiO2 interface, thus negative transfer shift.\nFigure 5(g) shows the VTH shift for VBG = -20V and VTG = 20V bias-stress indicating that the negative VTH shift increases both in bottom gate sweep and in top gate sweep. As shown in Figure 5(h), the negative VBG induces the hole/positive charge trapping at the bottom SiO2 interface.\nThe positive VTG populates the positive mobile charges In+) at top SiO2 interface, which increases with bias-stress time. In this case, the hole trapping at the bottom interface leads the negative VTH\nshift in bottom gate sweep. The positive charge trapping at top interface leads the negative VTH\nshift in the top gate sweep. Since bias voltage at top and bottom is the same, both interfaces can individually dominate by top/bottom bias.\nIn summary, we studied the abnormal behavior of the VTH shift in DG a-IGZO TFTs by applying the various bottom and top gate potentials for bias-stress effect. It is concluded that the electron/hole trapping at bottom SiO2/a-IGZO interface leads the VTH shift. However, the positive\n(In+) and negative (OH−) mobile charges in the top SiO2 deposited at low temperature can migrate by the VTG and affect the VTH shift. The XPS depth profile provides the evidence of Indium atom and OH molecules around the top SiO2 interface which can be the origin of abnormal VTH shift.\nThis study indicates the importance of top gate insulator for stable dual gate and coplanar a-IGZO TFTs.\n16 Lei Lu, Jiapeng Li, and Man Wong, Electron Devices, IEEE Transactions on 62, 3703 (2015). 17 S.

        "text": "Article Effects Of Annealing Temperature On Bias Temperature Stress Stabilities Of Bottom-Gate Coplanar In-Ga-Zn-O Thin-Film Transistors\nYuyun Chen 1, Yi Shen 1,*, Yuanming Chen 1, Guodong Xu 1, Yudong Liu 1 **and Rui Huang** 2,*\n1 Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Automotive Display and Touch Technologies, Shantou Goworld\nAbstract: Defect annihilation of the IGZO/SiO2layer is of great importance to enhancing the bias stress stabilities of bottom-gate coplanar thin-film transistors (TFTs). The effects of annealing temperatures (Ta) on the structure of the IGZO/SiO2layer and the stabilities of coplanar IGZO TFTs were investigated in this work. An atomic depth profile showed that the IGZO/SiO2layer included an IGZO layer, an IGZO/SiO2interfacial mixing layer, and a SiO2layer. Higher Ta had only one effect on the IGZO layer and SiO2layer (i.e., strengthening chemical bonds), while it had complex effects on the interfacial mixing layer—including weakening M-O bonds (M: metallic elements in IGZO), strengthening damaged Si-O bonds, and increasing O-related defects (e.g., H2O). At higher Ta, IGZO TFTs exhibited enhanced positive bias temperature stress (PBTS) stabilities but decreased negative bias temperature stress (NBTS) stabilities. The enhanced PBTS stabilities were correlated with decreased electron traps due to the stronger Si-O bonds near the interfacial layer. The decreased NBTS stabilities were related to increased electron de-trapping from donor-like defects (e.g., weak M-O bonds and H2O) in the interfacial layer. Our results suggest that although higher Ta annihilated the structural damage at the interface from ion bombardment, it introduced undesirable defects.\nTherefore, to comprehensively improve electrical stabilities, controlling defect generation (e.g., by using a mild sputtering condition of source/drain electrodes and oxides) was more important than enhancing defect annihilation (e.g., through increasing Ta).\nKeywords: annealing temperature; In-Ga-Zn-O; thin-film transistors; depth profile; X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy; bias temperature stress stabilities; interfacial mixing layer\n1. Introduction\nIndium-gallium-zinc oxide (IGZO) thin-film transistors (TFTs) are quite popular in the display field, due to their high mobility and transparency, large-area uniformity, and lowtemperature processability [1–3]. Positive bias temperature stress (PBTS) and negative bias temperature stress (NBTS) stabilities determine the on-state and off-state stabilities of IGZO\nTFTs, respectively, both of which are key issues for applications . In order to enhance the electrical stabilities and maintain the uniformity of amorphous IGZO TFTs, the active layers require annealing at a temperature that is higher than the deposition temperature\n(room temperature in most cases) but lower than the crystallization temperature (i.e.,\n~600 ◦C) [6–8]. Although the effects of annealing temperatures (Ta) on the IGZO films or the transfer characteristics of the as-fabricated IGZO TFTs have been studied [6,9–16], limited attention has been paid to their PBTS and NBTS stabilities, which are more important technical indicators. The structural origin (generally at the atomic scale) for the effects of Ta on bias stress stabilities has not been fully investigated.\nCitation: Chen, Y.; Shen, Y.; Chen, Y.;\nXu, G.; Liu, Y.; Huang, R.

Among these configurations, bottom-gate structures are commonly used for prototype displays since the gate metals at the bottom enable to blocking of the backlights.\nCompared with the staggered structure, the coplanar structure has some advantages such as simpler fabrication methods, lower contact resistances with source and drain electrodes, and smaller stray capacitances. Nevertheless, extra defects may be introduced at the interface between the active layer and the insulator of coplanar TFT during deposition and patterning of source/drain layers, which would affect the successive deposition of the active layer and result in poor electrical stabilities. Controlling the post-treatment temperature is important for coplanar TFTs to achieve a high-quality interface and active layer structure and enhance electrical stabilities.\nIn this work, the bottom-gate coplanar TFTs with IGZO films annealed at different Ta were prepared and their bias temperature stress stabilities were compared. The atomic structures of IGZO/dielectric layers were examined to understand the structural origin since the electrical instabilities were closely related to de-trapping or trapping of charged particles near or at the IGZO/dielectric interface [5,17–20]. Considering that multiple elements are irregularly involved within IGZO/dielectric layers, depth profiling was performed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) for a detailed structural analysis.\n2. Method\nThe bottom-gate coplanar IGZO TFTs were prepared using the following steps: 100 nm Mo, 200 nm SiO2, and 100 nm Mo were deposited on the glass substrates successively, which were the gate electrode, insulation dielectric, and source/drain electrode of the oxide TFTs. After magnetron sputtering deposition, each of the above layers was patterned using wet-etching methods. Then the active films were deposited by mid-frequency (MF)\nmagnetron sputtering of the IGZO targets (In2O3: Ga2O3: ZnO = 1:1:2 mol%). The IGZO\nfilms were annealed in air at different temperatures (Ta = 300 ◦C and 400 ◦C) for one hour and wet etched for the desired channel size (10 µm in length and 50 µm in width). Here, Ta below 250 ◦C was not considered, because it was found that the IGZO layer was not sufficiently oxidized at 250 ◦C and it was difficult to turn the TFTs off. Ta over 400 ◦C was not considered either since Mo was slightly oxidized at 400 ◦C and their conductivity may be more or less reduced. At last, 1 µm polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) passivation layers were coated and patterned to expose the gate, source, and drain electrodes.\nA P100 Source Meter was used to measure the transfer characteristics of our IGZO\nTFTs. During the drain current (IDS) measurement, the gate voltage (VGS) varied from\n−10 V to +20 V and the drain-source voltage (VDS) was maintained at 10.1 V. Based on the IDS-VGS transfer curves, we extracted some electrical parameters, including saturation mobility µ, subthreshold swing SS, the ratio of on-state to off-state current Ion/Ioff, and the threshold voltage Vth. The SS was calculated from the reciprocal of the maximum slope in the log (IDS)-VGS transfer curves. The µ and Vth were calculated by linear extrapolation of the IDS\n1/2-VGS transfer curves .\nThe electrical stabilities of IGZO TFTs were evaluated using positive bias temperature stress (PBTS) and negative bias temperature stress (NBTS) tests. During PBTS tests, VGS,\nVDS, and environmental temperature (T) were maintained at +20 V, 0.1 V, and 60 ◦C,\nrespectively. During NBTS tests, VGS, VDS, and T were set at −20 V, 0.1 V, and 60 ◦C,\nThe depth profile of IGZO/SiO2 layers was collated using scanning X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (PHI 5000 V Versa Probe III, Chigasaki, Japan) with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV, 50 W, 15 kV). To control/minimize the charge building, a conductive mask was used to provide a conducting pathway and charge neutralization facilities of XPS instruments were applied. When the XPS spectra were collected, the base vacuum of the testing chamber was kept at 6.9 × 10−8 Pa. The broad survey spectra were collected for the original surface, which included C1s signals. Then, the depth profiles profiles were further collected after every 0.5 min Ar+ sputtering. The energy and area of the Ar+ beam were set at 2 keV and 3 mm × 3 mm, respectively. The profiles of element contents (including carbon, oxygen, gallium, zinc, and indium) were obtained from these spectra. The C1s region showed that the carbon contamination was sufficiently removed after the first 0.5 min of sputtering. C1s at 284.8 eV for carbon on the surface were chosen for calibration. The core-level spectra were fitted using the Gaussian/Lorentzian function with Shirley-type background subtraction. The IGZO layers were also characterized using scanning electron spectroscopy (Gemini 450, Zeiss, Cambridge, UK). \nwere further collected after every 0.5 min Ar+sputtering.

Xps Characterization\nIn-depth photoelectron spectra in the range of 150~170 eV for IGZO/SiO2 samples annealed at different temperatures (Ta) are given in Figure 1. With increasing depth from the IGZO surface, variations in the photoelectron spectra can be divided into three stages.\nFirst, only one component centered at ~161.0 eV was observed in the spectra, the position of which agreed with that of the Ga3s component for the Ga2O3 reference samples .\nThis component can be attributed to the Ga-O bonds within the IGZO layer. The position as well as line shapes of the spectra at the first stage were almost unchanged (see the green spectra in Figure 1), indicating a uniform IGZO layer. Second, the Ga3s component shifted towards a lower binding energy (BE) side and an additional component at ~153.0 eV\nappeared. BE of the latter component was close to that of the Si2s component of SiO2 .\nSuch double-peak spectra suggest an IGZO-SiO2 interfacial mixing layer, the thickness of which was ~15 ± 2 nm. The interfacial mixing layer can be seen as the result of the implantation of atoms from the oxide target into the SiO2 surface. Third, there was only one Si2s component in the following spectra, which can be attributed to the signal from a SiO2 layer. The above variations indicate that the film structure of IGZO/SiO2 includes three parts: an IGZO layer, an IGZO/SiO2 interfacial mixing layer, and a SiO2 layer. The effects of Ta on the atomic structures of these three parts were further investigated.\nIn-depth photoelectron spectra in the range of 150~170 eV for IGZO/SiO2 samples annealed at different temperatures (Ta) are given in Figure 1. With increasing depth from the IGZO surface, variations in the photoelectron spectra can be divided into three stages. First, only one component centered at ~161.0 eV was observed in the spectra, the position of which agreed with that of the Ga3s component for the Ga2O3 reference samples . \nThis component can be attributed to the Ga-O bonds within the IGZO layer.

BE of the latter component was close to that of the Si2s component of SiO2 . \nSuch double-peak spectra suggest an IGZO-SiO2 interfacial mixing layer, the thickness of which was ~15 ± 2 nm.

The above variations indicate that the film structure of IGZO/SiO2 includes three parts: an IGZO layer, an IGZO/SiO2 interfacial mixing layer, and a SiO2 layer. The effects of Ta on the atomic structures of these three parts were further investigated. \n3.1.1. Igzo Layer 3.1.1. Igzo Layer\nFigure 2 displays core-level spectra collected at a depth of ~5 nm from the surface to exemplify the uniform structure of the IGZO layer. In Figure 2a–c, there were symmetric components centered at ~161.0 ± 0.1 eV, ~1022.15 ± 0.15 eV, and ~445.05 ± 0.15 eV, which were in agreement with those of the Ga3s, Zn2p, and In3d components of Ga2O3, ZnO,\nand In2O3 reference samples, respectively . These components arose from Ga-O,\nZn-O, and In-O bonds in the IGZO layer. The fitting spectra, which were generated from a one-component model, agreed well with the experimental spectra in Figure 2a–c. The Figure 2 displays core-level spectra collected at a depth of ~5 nm from the surface to exemplify the uniform structure of the IGZO layer. In Figure 2a–c, there were symmetric components centered at ~161.0 ± 0.1 eV, ~1022.15 ± 0.15 eV, and ~445.05 ± 0.15 eV, which were in agreement with those of the Ga3s, Zn2p, and In3d components of Ga2O3, ZnO, and In2O3 reference samples, respectively . These components arose from Ga-O, Zn-O, and In-O bonds in the IGZO layer. The fitting spectra, which were generated from \nfitting results (see in Table 1 ) showed that at higher T a , the full width of half maximum\n(FWHM) was nearly unvaried, but the position of these components shifted towards the higher BE side (i.e., +0.3 eV). These phenomena suggest an enhancement in the binding energy of Ga-O, Zn-O, and In-O bonds within the IGZO layer.\n| Ga3s          | Zn2p      | In3d          | 01s       |               |           |     |    |\n|---------------|-----------|---------------|-----------|---------------|-----------|-----|----|\n| T a (°C)      | FWHM (eV) | Position (eV) | FWHM (eV) | Position (eV) | FWHM (eV) |     |    |\n| Position (eV) | A OII (%) |               |           |               |           |     |    |\n| 300           | 160.9     | 3.3           | 1022.0    | 2.2           | 44.9      | 2.0 | 21 |\n| 400           | 161.2     | 3.3           | 1022.3    | 2.2           | 45.2      | 2.0 | 21 |\nIn Figure 2 d, asymmetric O1s spectra consist of one major component (O 1 ) at\n~30.9 ± 0.4 eV and a sub-component (O II ) on the high-BE side.  Generally, O I and O II\ncomponents were considered to be the result of M-O (M represents the metallic elements in IGZO) bonds and oxygen vacancies, respectively [ 27 - 29 ]. However, Idriss believes that a signal arising from an oxygen vacancy is impossible, based on the following reasons [ 30 ].\nFirst, it is unreasonable in principle that photoelectron spectroscopy enables one to measure the kinetic energy of a missing electron.  Second, the surface oxygen vacancies would be oxidized instantaneously in an ambient environment due to the strong adsorption energy of H2O, and thus ex situ measurements of oxygen vacancies were impossible. The sub-component in O1s spectra for metallic oxides is thus attributed to some structural imperfections containing oxygen atoms, such as hydroxyls, water molecules, and organic contaminants . In our case, the correlation between the sub-component and organic contaminants was excluded since there were no C1s signals for the spectra collected from the IGZO layer. Fitting spectra generated from a double-component model agreed well with the experimental O1s spectra, and the area ratio of the OII component (AOII%) was calculated. It was found that AOII% for the IGZO layer was not sensitive to Ta, suggesting that comparable O-related imperfections were introduced into the IGZO layer at both Ta.\n3.1.2. Igzo-Sio2 Interfacial Mixing Layer\nThe atomic structures of the IGZO-SiO2 interfacial mixing layer were further studied.\nIn Figure 3a–c, the Ga3s, Zn2p, and In3d components at 159.90 ± 0.01 eV, 1021.35 ± 0.05 eV,\nand 444.1 ± 0.1 eV, respectively, were observed in the core-level spectra of the interfacial mixing layer annealed at both Ta. Compared with those for the IGZO layer, the BE of these components for the interfacial mixing layer (Table 2) was relatively lower. Additionally, full width of half maximum (FWHM) values of the Zn2p and In3d components for the interfacial layer (Table 2) were larger than those for the IGZO layer. These differences indicate that the M-O chemical bonds in the interfacial mixing layer were weaker and more disordered than those in the IGZO layer. At higher Ta, the Ga3s and Zn2p components were almost unvaried, but the In3d component shifted evidently towards the low-BE side (−0.1 eV). These results suggest that Ga-O and Zn-O bonds became somewhat weaker while the In-O bonds turned out to be apparently weakened at higher Ta. This phenomenon can be interpreted in terms of their bond energy, which led to distinct thermal stabilities. The In-O bonds exhibit a relatively lower bond energy and thus are more thermally unstable compared with Ga-O\nand Zn-O bonds . Unlike those in the mixing layer, the In-O bonds within the IGZO layer were enhanced at higher Ta (Figure 2a–c). This distinction can be understood in terms of the dual role of Ta in the atomic structures. The annealing of amorphous semi-conductive oxides (i.e., heat treatment at temperatures below the crystallization temperature) is generally considered a defect in the annihilation process. Under these circumstances, more point defects will be annealed out at elevated temperatures due to their enhanced atomic mobility  or the combination with ambient gas .\nAs a result, the electrical stabilities of the oxides were improved. Nevertheless, some experimental evidence shows that semi-conductive oxides become electrically unstable with increasing ambient temperatures [37–39]. These abnormal phenomena revealed that a defect generation process is also involved in the annealing process, which would compete with the annihilation process and lead to an increase in atomic defects. In our case, the In-O bonds in the interfacial mixing layer were weaker than those in the IGZO layer, and thus they would be more easily broken by thermal vibration at higher Ta. Thus, at higher Ta, defect generation arising from breaking chemical bonds may overwhelm defect annihilation due to enhanced atomic mobility, leading to weakened In-O bonds in the interfacial mixing layer.\n| Ga3s     | Zn2p     | In3d   | Si2s     | O1s   |          |      |          |           |          |\n|----------|----------|--------|----------|-------|----------|------|----------|-----------|----------|\n| Ta ( ◦C) | Position | FWHM   | Position | FWHM  | Position | FWHM | Position | FWHM (eV) | AOII%(%) |\n| (eV)     | (eV)     | (eV)   | (eV)     | (eV)  | (eV)     | (eV) |          |           |          |\n| 300      | 159.91   | 2.8    | 1021.38  | 2.5   | 444.13   | 2.4  | 152.5    | 3.1       | 20       |\n| 400      | 159.89   | 3.0    | 1021.35  | 2.5   | 444.02   | 2.5  | 152.8    | 3.1       | 24       |\nThere was one more component centered at 152.65 ± 0.15 eV in the spectra in the range of 150~170 eV (Figure 3 a), which pointed to the Si2s component [ 24 ]. The binding energy of this component for the interfacial mixing layer (Table 2 ) was smaller than that for the SiO 2 layer (as shown in Figure 4 and Table 3 ), indicating that at the initial growth of IGZO, ion bombardment led to structural damages (for instance, dangling bonds and weak bonds). Although BE of Si2s component for the interfacial layer increased at higher T a , it was still smaller than that for the SiO 2 layer. These phenomena suggest that although the structural damages at interface resulting from ion bombardment were reduced at higher T a , they were unable to be totally annihilated.\n| Si2s    | 01s           |           |               |           |\n|---------|---------------|-----------|---------------|-----------|\n| Ta (°C) | Position (eV) | FWHM (eV) | Position (eV) | FWHM (eV) |\n| 300     | 153.2         | 3.2       | 531.5         | 2.3       |\n| 400     | 153.3         | 3.1       | 531.6         | 2.4       |\nIn Figure 3 d, the O1s spectra at both T a were asymmetric with a sub-component on the high-BE side. As mentioned above, the sub-component on the high-BE side arises from O-related defects (for example, hydroxyls, water molecules, and organic contaminants).\nAt higher T a , the intensity of the sub-component increased.  The curve-fitting analysis also showed that the area ratio of the sub-component (AOII%) increased at higher Ta.\nBoth direct observation and indirect analysis showed that higher Ta resulted in more Orelated defects in the interfacial mixing layer.

This result suggests that annealing temperatures over 300~400 °C had no effect on the surface morphology of IGZO layers. \n3.3. Bias Stress Stabilities 3.3.1. Transfer Characteristics\nThe transfer characteristics of as-fabricated TFTs with IGZO annealed at different T a were compared (see the green curves in Figure 6 ). First, at higher T a , the transfer curves shifted negatively, indicating a negative shift in the threshold voltage (V th ). Actually, many researchers have observed more negative V th for as-fabricated TFTs with IGZO annealed at higher temperatures [ 6 , 9 , 11 , 12 , 14 , 41 ]. Such a negatively shifted V th at higher T a was related to the decreased resistance of our IGZO films (R). The R-value of the IGZO annealed at 400 °C (4.1 × 10 5 Ω) was at least two orders of magnitude less than that of the IGZO annealed at 300 °C (>4 × 10 7 Ω). The decreased resistance was attributed to the increased carrier concentration because the saturation mobilities of our TFTs with IGZO annealed at different T a were similar (as listed in Table 4 ). Second, the slope in the linear region of the transfer curves in the higher-T a case increased, which suggests a lower subthreshold swing\n(SS). As suggested for amorphous silicon thin-film transistors, the interfacial trap density\n( N SS Max ) can be estimated from SS by the following equation:\n$$N_{S S}^{M a x}=\\left(\\frac{S S l o g(e)}{k T/q}-1\\right)\\frac{C_{o x}}{q}$$\n$\\eqref{eq:walpha}$. \nwhere k is the Boltzmann constant, q is the electron charge, T is the temperature, and C ox is the insulator capacitance per unit area [ 42 , 43 ]. Given the fact that the Cox of our SiO 2 dielectric was 2.4 × 10 − 8 F/cm 2 , the N ss Max of our TFTs decreased from 1~2 × 10 12 /cm 2 to\n~8 × 10 11 /cm 2 when T a increased from 300 °C to 400 °C.\n| ◦C)      | State         | µ (cm2 /Vs)   | SS (V/dec)   | Ion/Ioff   | Vth (V)   | ∆Vth (V)   |\n|----------|---------------|---------------|--------------|------------|-----------|------------|\n| Ta ( 300 | As-fabricated | 95            | 0.77         | 7.6 × 106  | 1.7       | +1.5       |\n| 3h PBTS  | 103           | 0.72          | 2.5 × 106    | 3.2        |           |            |\n| 400      | As-fabricated | 93            | 0.44         | 3.7 × 107  | −3.2      | 0.0        |\n| 3h PBTS  | 105           | 0.44          | 4.2 × 107    | −3.2       |           |            |\n| 300      | As-fabricated | 103           | 0.57         | 8.4 × 106  | 1.3       | −1.9       |\n| 3h NBTS  | 124           | 0.63          | 5.6 × 107    | −0.6       |           |            |\n| 400      | As-fabricated | 95            | 0.40         | 6.0 × 107  | −2.5      | −4.5       |\n| 3h NBTS  | 102           | 0.54          | 3.0 × 107    | −7.0       |           |            |\nTable 4. The electrical parameters (including mobility µ, subthreshold swing SS, Ion and Ioff ratio Ion/Ioff, threshold voltage Vth, and Vth shift ∆Vth) extracted from the transfer curves in Figure 5.\n3.3.2. Positive Bias Temperature Stress (PBTS) Stabilities PBTS stabilities of TFTs with IGZO annealed at 300 ◦C to 400 ◦C were further studied.\nThe TFT with IGZO annealed at 300 ◦C exhibited a positive Vth shift (+1.3 V) without any change in SS after 1h PBTS, and then turned out to be stable after 2 h or 3 h of PBTS\n(Figure 6a). The amplitude of such a ∆Vth was smaller than those of the reported oxide TFTs under the same PBTS conditions (Table 5). The positively shifted Vth under PBTS is primarily attributed to the electron trapping near or at the semiconductor/insulator (S/I)\ninterface, without generating a new state [17–19]. However, neither position nor shape was varied after PBTS for the TFT with IGZO annealed at 400 ◦C (Figure 6c), indicating improved PBTS stabilities. Given the fact that the carrier concentration increased at higher T (as discussed in Section 3.3.1), the increased PBTS stabilities correlated with the reduced interface trap (as evident by the smaller SS), which lessened the effects of electron trapping near or at the IGZO/SiO2 interface.\nAs revealed by XPS analysis, the improved structural features near/at the IGZO/SiO2 interface involved stronger Si-O bonds in the interfacial mixing layer. Cho et al. observed that oxide TFT, with stronger Si-O bonds on the insulation surface, exhibited smaller ∆Vth under PBTS . In this sense, the reduced interfacial traps, resulting in the enhanced PBTS\nstabilities at higher Ta, may be due to the strengthened Si-O bonds near/at the interface.\n3.3.3. Negative Bias Temperature Stress (Nbts) Stabilities\nThe effects of Ta on NBTS stabilities were somewhat different from those on PBTS\nstabilities. The TFT with IGZO annealed at 300 ◦C showed a negative Vth shift (−2.0 V)\nafter 1 h NBTS and became stable after 2 h or 3 h of NBTS (Figure 6b). The amplitude of this negative ∆Vth was in the range of the reported values for oxide TFTs under the same NBTS conditions. However, the TFT with IGZO annealed at 400 ◦C presented a continuous negative Vth shift during NBTS, resulting in a larger Vth shift (−4.5 V) after 3 h of NBTS\n(Figure 6d). In other words, higher Ta slightly increased the NBTS instabilities. Similarly, Chen et al. reported that higher a post-annealing temperature resulted in increased negative bias stress instabilities . Three mechanisms for instabilities under negative bias stress have been proposed: hole trapping at the S/I interface , defect generation in active layers , and electron de-trapping at the S/I interface . The first mechanism was not considered because the number of holes in n-type semiconductors was negligible.\nThe second mechanism was unable to explain our experimental results since (i) the defect state in the IGZO would result in degradation in SS and µ, rather than the almost unvaried SS and slightly increased µ (Table 4), and (ii) the XPS results revealed that no extra structural defects were introduced into the IGZO layer at higher Ta (see in Section 3.1.1). Therefore, our increased NBTS instabilities at higher Ta were mainly attributed to the enhanced electron de-trapping near or at the S/I interface. Under negative bias stress, the interfacial donor-like defects released electrons towards the IGZO layer and turned out to be positively charged. The released electrons would be trapped within the IGZO layer and thus are not recovered instantly. In the following bias sweeping, the positively charged donorlike defects and trapped electrons formed a residual field, leading to enhanced electron accumulation in the front channel, which, in turn, resulted in a negative ∆Vth.\nOur XPS analysis showed that the increased interfacial defects at higher Ta include weakened M-O bonds and increased O-related defects (e.g., water molecules and hydroxyls).\nMuch experimental evidence has shown that the weakened M-O bonds and water molecules were donor-like in nature, which enables the release of electrons and results in a larger Vth shift under negative bias stress . Therefore, the increased NBTS instabilities can be attributed to the weakened M-O bonds and increased water molecules in the IGZO/SiO2 interfacial mixing layer.\n| Configuration   | Active Layer   | VGS (V)   | Temp (◦C)   | Time (s)   | ∆Vth (V)   | Reference   |\n|-----------------|----------------|-----------|-------------|------------|------------|-------------|\n| Coplanar_BG     | IGZO           | +20       | 60          | 3000       | 2.5        |         |\n| Staggered_BG    | IGZO           | +20       | 60          | 3600       | 0.5        |         |\n| Staggered_BG    | IGZTO          | +20       | 60          | 7200       | 1.8        |         |\n| Staggered_BG    | IZO            | +20       | 60          | 7200       | 3.0        |         |\n| Staggered_BG    | IZO:Pr         | +20       | 60          | 7200       | 2.0        |         |\n| Coplanar_BG     | IGZO           | +20       | 60          | 10,800     | 1.3        | This work   |\n| Staggered_BG    | SZTO           | −20       | 60          | 3600       | −2         |         |\n| Staggered_BG    | SZTO           | −20       | 60          | 3600       | −2.73      |         |\n| Staggered_BG    | IGZO           | −20       | 60          | 3600       | −0.5       |         |\n| Staggered_BG    | IGZTO          | −20       | 60          | 7200       | 0.5        |         |\n| Staggered_BG    | IZO            | −20       | 60          | 7200       | −0.8       |         |\n| Staggered_BG    | IZO:Pr         | −20       | 60          | 7200       | −0.71      |         |\n| Staggered_BG    | IZO            | −20       | 60          | 10,800     | −3.5       |         |\n| Staggered_BG    | HIZO           | −20       | 60          | 10,800     | −3~−1      |         |\n| Coplanar_BG     | IGZO           | −20       | 60          | 10,800     | −2         | This work   |\n4. Discussions\nThe above experimental results showed that the structural quality of the IGZO/SiO2 interfacial mixing layer was the key structural factor for the electrical stabilities of bottomgate coplanar IGZO TFTs. In this part, we discuss how the processing conditions affect this key factor in order to propose the main points for preparing electrically stable semiconductive devices.\nFor bottom-gate coplanar TFTs, structural imperfections forming from the insulation surface are inevitable during the preparation of source/drain electrodes and the active layer . To enhance the performance of devices, post-heat treatment (for example, by adjusting Ta) is necessary to reduce these structural defects. Therefore, the structural quality of the oxide/insulator interfacial mixing layer depends on the competition between defect generation from ion bombardment and defect annihilation through heat treatment.\nOur study, as well as other reported results [10,13,14,57], showed that unlimited enhancement in post-heat treatment by increasing Ta would result in negative effects on oxide TFTs (such as degraded transfer characteristics and electrical stabilities). Seen in this light, higher Ta would play a negative role in defect generation, rather than the generally considered positive role in defect annihilation, when Ta was increased up to a certain degree. In this work, XPS analysis (as schematically drawn in Figure 7) revealed that at higher Ta, although the damaged Si-O bonds were partially annihilated, the weak M-O bonds were easily broken due to thermal vibration. Moreover, more undesired molecules (e.g., water molecules) from the ambient atmosphere were introduced into the interfacial mixing layer at higher Ta because of the enhanced diffusion length. As a result, the electrical stabilities of IGZO TFTs were not comprehensively improved, i.e., enhanced PBTS stabilities but degraded NBTS stabilities. Thus, unlimitedly enhancing annealing temperatures may not be an effective way to improve the structural quality of the interfacial layer. In this regard, controlling defect generation is more important to achieving a high-quality interfacial layer.\nelectrical stabilities of IGZO TFTs were not comprehensively improved, i.e., enhanced PBTS stabilities but degraded NBTS stabilities.

LTD., \nSamsung-ro, Giheung, Yongin, Gyeonggi-do, 17113, Kore Abstract Effects of light on InGaZnO (IGZO) thin film transistors were investigated under the AC gate bias illumination stress. DC NBIS on IGZO device results in dramatic negative Vth shifts. Whereas, Vth shift tends to disappear when the specific AC gate stress is applied with light exposure. We found that NBIS effect is released in specific pulse peak bias zone for fixed pulse frequency, base pulse voltage and duty. Hence, if we employ the pulse shape in specific zone, intrinsic reliability concerns over IGZO device particularly with NBIS would not be technical huddle for volume manufacturing production. \nIGZO (In-Ga-Zn-Oxide), NBIS (Negative Bias Illumination Stability), PBIS (Positive Bias Illumination Stability), Valence Band Offset, AC (Alternating Current). \n1. Introduction\nInGaZnO (IGZO) TFT have attracted much attention for their possible benefits to advanced flexible display technologies. In fact, high field-effect mobility, low sub-threshold swing (SS), and high on/off current ratio, enable IGZO TFT a suitable active device for organic light emitting display . In particular, low off-state leakage current enables IGZO TFT to low frequency operation without flickering effect . However, one of drawbacks hindering full implementation of the a-IGZO TFTs is Vth instability under negative bias with illumination stress (NBIS) . Much works have been done to reduce NBIS effect on IGZO TFTs. The IGZO TFTs with SiNx as gate dielectric material show smaller NBIS effect than the IGZO TFTS with SiO2 as gate dielectric material . Ozone treatment on ZTO channel , ZrO2 doped ZTO channel  also show the lower NBIS effects. Besides these process optimization or channel treatment to reduce NBIS, operating method such as alternating current (AC) gate bias also improved the NBIS effect . Even such a lot of study of AC operation on IGZO TFT no systematic study for various pulse mode has not been reported yet. In this paper, we investigated the AC amplitude dependency on illumination stress for the first time. We also described the intrinsic behavior of light for IGZO TFTs during NBIS and PBIS. \n2. Experimental\nTop gate IGZO TFTs and p-type poly-Si TFTs were employed in this study. **Fig. 1** shows the comparison of NBIS effect between IGZO TFT and p-type poly-Si TFT. More than –4 V of threshold voltage change is observed in IGZO TFT, whereas no change is shown in poly-Si TFT for the same stress conditions, Vg = -20 V \nDC, 60oC, 4,000s, 1,000 nit white LED. The same kind of NBIS \neffect of IGZO TFT is already reported by J. H Shin et al . The reported mechanism of NBIS is known to be the charge trapping of photo-generated holes at the gate insulator and/or insulator/channel interface , defect creation by positively ionized oxygen vacancies (Vo 2+ or Vo +) . However the real operation voltage in display panel is AC type not DC, it is worthwhile to study AC behavior of NBIS for IGZO TFTs. We applied AC stress with different peak voltage for each pulses. \nconditioned with Vgs = - 20V DC and Vds = 0V at 60oC, white light 1,000 nits, W/L= 4/5 Pm. \n4.6V, respectively. For fixed based bias (-4.6V), peak voltage (amplitude) was varied from –1V to 10V. The substrate temperature and stress time was 60oC, 4000s, respectively, with white light of 1000 nit exposing. Two different AC pulse voltages are illustrated in Fig. 3. **Fig. 3(a)** always remains negative. In type (b), for short duty time the gate has a chance to swing up to positive bias. Because the duty is 1/100, all the pulses remain negative voltage mostly, we call it roughly as NBIS even pulse mode. \nFig. 3. (a) pulse: always remains negative bias and (b) pulse: for short duty time the pulse experience positive gate bias but most time the pulse remains negative gate bias, - 4.6 V. \n3. Results And Discussion\n2V, 4.6V, and 10V with the same NBIS conditions at 60oC, 4,000 seconds with white light of 1,000 nit. For peak voltage -1V, 'Vth is measured -2.5V. For peak voltage of 2V, it still shows negative threshold voltage shift. For peak voltages 4.6V and 10V, NBIS effect is nearly disappeared. \npositive gate stress (DC) can detrap holes which are trapped during DC NBIS . In this experiment, as the DC PBTS time increases after DC NBIS the transfer curve moves more back to the virgin TFTs. \nFig. 5 shows the resulting threshold voltage shift for various pulse peak voltage stress. For fixed base pulse bias of -4.6V, as the peak voltage increases the smaller 'Vth is observed. Interestingly for peak voltages larger than around 4.6V, 'Vth is disappeared. Peak voltage 4.6V may be related to pulse base voltage -4.6V. It is noticeable that even the gate remain mostly negative voltage state with portion of 99% due to 1/100 duty the short time positive gate bias can eliminate NBIS. According to the previous study on NBIS, \nWhen the light and off gate bias are applied to IGZO TFT, the generated holes by light can be moved to interface between IGZO \nand SiO2 by En. Because the band offset (Vboff) of 1.4~2eV  \nbetween IGZO and SiO2 is small compared to light energy which transfer its energy to hole, the holes exited by light have enough energy to overcome VVBO . And with En, the holes can be trapped in the interface of energy levels marked 1, 2, 3 via 11 process. Then, when the gate bias changes to on state of **Fig. 6** (b), the trapped holes marked 4, *5, 6* may be detrapped by Ep. To detrap the holes having the highest trapped energy level like 6, the minimum pulse peak should larger than 4.6V. In the case of PBIS, the conduction band offset (Cboff), 4.3eV, is so high that exited electron by light cannot have enough energy to overcome CCBO. Therefore photo exited electrons are rarely trapped in GI interface, thereby PBIS in IGZO TFT is negligible. To investigate the external light effect on panel we prepared two types of panels -IGZO and LTPS panel. The source of light was metal halide whose components of wave length are similar to natural sun light. The exposing light intensity was 10 k Lux for 120h. Operating and nun operating, all half part of the panels were screened by Al foil to protect the external light. As shown in **Fig. 7**, the luminance change by external light is not distinguishable irrespective of illumination (not screened) or not (screened), also operating or non operating, IGZO or LTPS. This is the same result of above single TFT pulse experiment because the real operating voltage in panel is AC type. Therefore, intrinsic reliability concerns over IGZO device particularly with DC NBIS would not be technical huddle for mass production. \n4. Conclusion\nEffects of NBIS on IGZO device has been investigated compared with LTPS. IGZO device suffers 'Vt shifts from light exposure due mainly to a narrow bandoffset. However, such 'Vt shifts tends to alleviate when AC pulse peak gate voltage is increased over 4.6V. This results have been explained by hole detrapping with a positive gate bias. To understand display image performance, we expand the scope to luminance behaviors in the panel levels. We found that the luminance degradation of IGZO panel by external light under operating is indistinguishable compared with LTPS panel. Indeed, IGZO technology successfully demonstrate excellent performance and reliability. Such excellent attributes can be well fitted to high quality and high volume production, in which stringent display image performance quality is required without compromising reliability. "

Herein, we have investigated the effect of nitrogen and hydrogen (N/H) codoping on the electrical performance and reliability of amorphous InGaZnO\n(α-IGZO) TFTs. The performance and bias stress stability of α-IGZO device were simultaneously improved by N/H plasma treatment with a high field-effect mobility of 45.3 cm2/(V s)\nand small shifts of threshold voltage (Vth). On the basis of Xray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis, the improved electrical performances of α-IGZO TFT should be attributed to the appropriate amount of N/H codoping, which could not only control the Vth and carrier concentration efficiently, but also passivate the defects such as oxygen vacancy due to the formation of stable ZnN and NH bonds. Meanwhile, low-frequency noise analysis indicates that the average trap density near the α-IGZO/SiO2 interface is reduced by the nitrogen and hydrogen plasma treatment. This method could provide a step toward the development of α-IGZO TFTs for potential applications in nextgeneration high-definition optoelectronic displays.\nKEYWORDS: thin-film transistors, InGaZnO, low-frequency noise, plasma treatment, reliability\n1. Introduction\nThe increasing demand for large-area, transparent, flexible, and low-cost electronics for utilization in high-resolution and fastspeed optoelectronic displays requires development of highperformance thin-film transistors (TFTs).1,2 In this regard, metal oxide TFTs have attracted much attention because of their desirable electron mobility, good optical transparency, and mechanical flexibility compared with hydrogenated amorphous silicon based TFTs.3,4 Specifically, amorphous InGaZnO (αIGZO) have been widely used as the active channel layer in TFTs for optoelectronic displays.5,6 However, the mobility is insufficient to satisfy the latest demands for high-resolution and high-definition displays. Moreover, the high density trap states and native point defect states have existed at the channel/ insulator layer interfaces and the channel layer, which may lead to the insufficient mobility and instability problems of α-IGZO\nTFTs.7−9 Therefore, it is a challenging issue to improve the interface quality and reduce the native defects states for enhancing the mobility and stability of α-IGZO TFTs.\nIn addition, plasma treatment has been demonstrated as an\nefficient method to modulate the carrier concentration (Ne)\nand reduce the defect states associated with oxygen vacancies\n(VO) in the metal oxide thin films.10 Thus, many studies have been presented on the electrical properties of metal oxide TFTs, such as mobility, channel resistance, and stability, have been improved by using different plasma treatment.11−13 Especially for hydrogen plasma treatment, in which H can act as a shallow n-type donor in an α-IGZO thin film when it occupies interstitial positions (Hi) or VO sites (VOH\ncomplexes or HO),7,14 and exhibits strong bonding with oxygen\n(OH) in ZnO-based thin films owing to the chemical natures of both elements.15−17 Recently, various groups have demonstrated that hydrogen plasma treatment could increase the Ne and improve the performance of α-IGZO TFTs, which indicated that hydrogen could act as a shallow donor in α-\nReceived: November 28, 2016 Accepted: March 7, 2017 Published: March 7, 2017\nIGZO thin films.12,18,19 However, some researchers have also observed that heavy hydrogen doping undesirably leads to photobias instability and large negative Vth shift of the α-IGZO\nTFTs.20,21 However, N can not only can act as an acceptor, but also serve as a defect binder because the ionic radius of N is close to O, thus N could effectively substitute for O (NO) and reduce VO in the ZnO-based thin films.22 So the N plasma treatment could improve the bias stability of the α-IGZO\nTFTs.23,24 However, the degradation of mobility and reduction of optical band gap energy of the N doped α-IGZO TFT were also observed.24,25 As an alternative approach, a strategy of cation and anion codoping can provide an effective solution to the adverse tradeoff between electrical performance and reliability of α-IGZO\nTFTs. In this work, we have demonstrated that both the electrical performance and the reliability of α-IGZO TFTs were simultaneously improved by the proper amount of N/H plasma treatment because of the reduction of VO defects and interface trap density (Dit). Furthermore, to understand the charge trap mechanisms with variations in VO and distribution of trap sites in the α-IGZO TFTs, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS),\nand low-frequency noise (LFN) analyses were carried out.\n2. Experimental Section\n2.1. Device Fabrication. The α-IGZO TFTs were fabricated on SiO2/Si substrates, where the highly doped p-type silicon wafer was used as the gate electrode and the thermally oxidized (100 nm) SiO2 layer as the gate insulator. First, a 25 nm α-IGZO thin film was deposited on the SiO2/Si substrate by (RF) magnetron sputtering using the ceramic target (In2O3:Ga2O3:ZnO = 1:1:1 in mole ratio, 99.99%). During the sputtering deposition, the RF power was 50 W,\nthe gas mixing ratio was fixed at Ar:O2 = 8.9:0.1, the total gas pressure was maintained at 0.55 Pa, and the substrate temperature was set as 150 °C, respectively. Then, the sample was directly treated in the aforementioned RF magnetron sputtering system with a closed shutter by incorporating N2, H2, and N2/H2 plasma with gas mixing ratio of N2:Ar = 10:40, H2:Ar = 10:40 and N2:H2:Ar = 10:10:40 in the sputtering system. When treated N2, H2, and N2/H2 plasma, the plasma treatment time was 0, 100, 200, and 300 s, respectively. Finally, 80 nm Al source and drain electrodes were sputtered by a direct current sputtering process at a power of 70 W. All devices were not subjected to any post-thermal annealing.\n2.2. Film and Device Characterization. Electrical characteristics of the TFTs were extracted by using a keysight Semiconductor Parameter Analyzer B1500A, B2912, and Lake Shore TTPX Probe Station at room temperature. To realize the chemical compositions and bonding states, the XPS spectra measurements were performed with a Thermo Fisher ESCALAB 250Xi instrument equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα (1486.68 eV) X-ray source, and the binding energies were calibrated using the C (1s) carbon peak (284.8 eV). The low-frequency 1/f noise (LFN) measurements were carried out by Agilent E4725A 1/f noise system with an Agilent E5052B.\n3. Results And Discussion\nSchematic diagram in Figure 1a illustrates the proposed scheme of α-IGZO bottom-gate and top contact device structure with different plasma treatments. First of all, to understand the effect of N in α-IGZO TFTs, the transfer characteristics of the αIGZO TFT after different N plasma treatment time of 0, 100, 200, and 300 s have been measured, respectively, as shown in Figure 1b. It is clear that a small amount of N doped in α-IGZO\nTFT could improve the subthreshold slope (SS) and Vth value than that of the undoped α-IGZO TFTs. These results indicate that N doping could passivate the defects such as VO and trap density at the α-IGZO/SiO2 interfaces.23 However, the fieldeffect mobility (μFE) is slightly decreased with increasing N\nplasma treatment time. In addition, the Ne is obviously decreased from 3.5 × 1018 cm−3 to 5.2 × 1017 cm−3 for the α-IGZO and α-IGZO:N (300 s) device, as shown in Figure 1e.\nThe Ne was estimated by the microexpression of maximum current at the maximum μFE for all devices.26 The degradation of electrical properties was mainly originated from the generation of tail states related to N vacancies (due to excess of N atoms) in the α-IGZO films.23,24 It should be noted that the N vacancies form a positive charge and thus act as an electron trap center in the α-IGZO/SiO2 interface, which also cause the degradation of μFE and Vth instabilities.23,24 On the contrary, after H plasma treatment, the conductivity of α-IGZO\nα-IGZO:N/H IDS (μA) Vth (V) μFE (cm2/(V s)) Ion/Ioff SS (V/dec.) Dit (cm−2/eV) Nt (cm−3/eV)\n0 s 26.4 2.8 ± 0.4 15.5 ± 0.5 4 × 107 0.53 ± 0.06 1.7 × 1012 3.5 × 1019\n100 s 51.1 2.1 ± 0.2 31.3 ± 0.6 2 × 108 0.28 ± 0.04 7.5 × 1011 8.7 × 1018\n200 s 83.2 1.7 ± 0.1 45.3 ± 0.8 3 × 108 0.21 ± 0.03 4.5 × 1011 5.6 × 1018\nTFT was dramatically increased and became very conductive due to the increasing Ne, as shown in Figure 1c. Specifically, the Ne of α-IGZO TFT is obviously increased from 3.5 × 1018 cm−3 to 2.3 × 1019 cm−3 after the 300 s hydrogen treatment, as shown in Figure 1e. Although the α-IGZO:H (300 s) TFT\nexhibited was very conductive, the TFT lost its gate control ability and showed large negative shift Vth because of the excessive H plasma treatment. These results indicate that the H\ncan act as a shallow donor and increase the Ne in α-IGZO films, which agrees with the previous studies.18−20 In addition, we have figured out the effect of hydrogen on a-IGZO TFTs, and our results demonstrated that the conduction band energy level offset (ΔECB) is decreased after H plasma treatment.19 On the bases of semiconductor physics, the smaller ΔECB in α-IGZO:H\nleads to easier activation of electrons compared with the αIGZO film, which indicates that the Ne is increased by H\nTo overcome the disadvantages of the α-IGZO:N and αIGZO:H TFTs, the N/H codoping α-IGZO TFTs were studied systematically. Figure 1d,f shows the typical transfer and output curves of the α-IGZO and α-IGZO:N/H devices with the different plasma treatment times, and these devices exhibit the typical n-channel enhancement mode. Also, the transfer linear curves of the α-IGZO and α-IGZO:N/H devices are shown in Figure S1 of the Supporting Information. Furthermore, the extracted electrical characteristics of the both α-IGZO and α-IGZO:N/H devices, including Vth, SS, IDS,\non/off current ratio (Ion/Ioff), Dit, and μFE, are summarized in Table 1. In all devices, the Vth was determined from the horizontal intercept of a linear part in IDS1/2 versus VGS plot. It can be seen that the IDS, μFE of α-IGZO:N/H TFTs were apparently increased with an increase of N/H plasma treatment time, as shown in Figures 1d and S2, respectively. Specifically, the μFE is obviously increased from 15.5 to 45.3 cm2/(V s) for the α-IGZO and α-IGZO:N/H (200 s) TFT. The μFE can be obtained from the following equation:3\n$$\\mu_{_\\mathrm{FE}}={\\frac{s_{\\mathrm{m}}-}{W W_{\\mathrm{DS}}C_{\\mathrm{ox}}}}$$\nwhere gm is transconductance and can be obtained by deriving\nthe IDS−VGS curve, Cox is capacitance per unit area, and L (120 μm) and W (150 μm) are the channel length and width, respectively. Moreover, in view of the performance variance is associated with the nonuniformity of a-IGZO film thickness as well as device fabrication, a statistical study of the key parameter of devices is necessary to gain a comprehensive understanding of the electrical properties. Figure S3 show the distributions of μFE with different devices. A total of 40 devices are studied for each type of devices. The average and standard deviation of the calculated mobility are 11.4 ± 4.1 and 35.2 ±\n10.1 cm2/(V s) for the pristine a-IGZO and a-IGZO:N/H (200 s) devices, respectively. Therefore, the nonuniformity of devices is caused by the device fabrication process, size, quality of aIGZO ceramic target, and nonuniform gas distribution during the deposition films.10 Besides, the SS value is significantly decreased from 0.53 to 0.21 V/decade for the α-IGZO and αIGZO:N/H (200 s) TFT, as shown in Figure S2 and Table 1, respectively. For all devices, the SS value can be obtained by the following:3\n$$=\\left({\\frac{d\\mathrm{log}(I_{\\mathrm{DS}})}{d V_{\\mathrm{GS}}}}\\right)^{-1}$$\n$\\eqref{eq:walpha}$. \n$$({\\mathfrak{I}})$$\nwhere IDS is the drain to source current, and VGS is the gate bias. It is well-known that the Vth and SS of metal oxide TFTs are related to the Dit and the number of deep states.3,8 On the basis of the above SS value, the Dit could be obtained from the following equation:8\n$$D_{\\mathrm{{it}}}={\\frac{C_{\\mathrm{{ox}}}}{q^{2}}}{\\bigg(}{\\frac{q\\mathrm{SS}}{k T\\mathrm{ln}\\ 10}}-1{\\bigg)}$$\nwhere q is the elementary electron charge, kT is the thermal energy, and Cox is the gate dielectric capacitance per unit area.\nTherefore, the Dit value is decreased from 1.7 × 1012 cm−2/eV\nto 4.5 × 1011 cm−2/eV for α-IGZO and α-IGZO:N/H (200 s)\nTFTs, respectively. From Figure 1e, we can see that the Ne of α-IGZO:N/H device has not any change obviously, because the NO acceptor has been passivated by hydrogen.27,28 It should be noted that the device exhibits the degraded performance such as μFE (23 cm2/(V s)), SS (0.36 V/decade), Dit (1.7 × 1012 cm−2/eV), and Vth (2.5 V) when N/H treatment time is increased to 300 s, which mainly originates from the heavy N/\nH treatment and carrier scattering events for channel electrons. Therefore, the improved electrical performance can be attributed to the fact that the appropriate amount of N/H treatment could suppress the natural intrinsic defects states in α-IGZO films and reduce trap density at the α-IGZO/SiO2 interfaces. Additionally, the AFM results showed that the rootmean-square roughness is obviously decreased from 0.76 nm of a-IGZO to 0.23 nm of a-IGZO:N/H (200 s) film, as shown in Figure S4, which indicated that the surface morphology of the a-IGZO film became smoother by N/H plasma treatment. After the optimization, the α-IGZO:N/H (200 s) device exhibits high electrical performance, including a high Ion/Ioff of 108, a high μFE of 45.3 cm2/(V s), a small SS of 0.21 V/decade, and a reasonable Vth value of 1.7 V compared to that of the α-IGZO\nTo characterize the effects of N/H codoping on stability of α-IGZO TFT, the negative gate bias stress (NBS) and positive gate bias stress (PBS) stability of α-IGZO and α-IGZO:N/H\n(200 s) TFTs were analyzed, where both of the devices were stressed under a VG of ±20 V and stress duration of 3600 s at room temperature. Figure 2a,b show the evolution of transfer characteristics as a function of NBS time for the a-IGZO TFT\nand α-IGZO:N/H (200 s) TFT, respectively. The α-IGZO\nTFT exhibits a large negative Vth shift (ΔVth) of −9.2 V under the NBS with stress time of 3600 s. However, the α-IGZO:N/\nH (200 s) TFT exhibits a small negative ΔVth of −1.6 V under the identical NBS condition. Meanwhile, Figure S5 shows the evolution of transfer characteristics as a function of PBS time for the α-IGZO and α-IGZO:N/H (200 s) TFT, respectively.\nThe α-IGZO TFT showed a large positive ΔVth of 9.7 V under the PBS with stress time of 3600 s. Nevertheless, the αIGZO:N/H (200 s) TFT showed a small positive ΔVth of 1.8 V\nunder the identical PBS condition. Furthermore, the ΔVth as a function of bias stress time for the α-IGZO and α-IGZO:N/H\n(200 s) devices are shown in Figure 2c. It was found that the αIGZO:N/H (200 s) device exhibits apparently better bias stress stability, which shows much smaller ΔVth without degradation μFE and SS value than that of the α-IGZO device. It should be noted that the negative and positive ΔVth after NBS and PBS\nfor both of the devices can be explained by the following mechanisms: the field-induced charge trapping, the absorption/\ndesorption of oxygen-related molecules, and the creation of ionized VO defects at the channel/dielectric interface.8,9,29−31 According to the above experimental results, we have assumed that the improved stability of α-IGZO TFT is related to the reduction of VO defects and trap density at the near α-IGZO/\nSiO2 interfaces. In addition, the Dit value of α-IGZO:N/H (200 s) device showed lower than that of the α-IGZO device, which is consistent with the change in the Vth under gate bias stress.\nIn order to understand the reason and mechanism, XPS\nmeasurement was carried out to realize the qualitative chemical properties of the α-IGZO and α-IGZO:N/H (200 s) films. The relative O 1s spectra are shown in Figure S6. Therefore, the O\n1s spectrum can be deconvoluted into three different peaks by using Gaussian fitting with the subtraction of a Shirley type background. The O 1s region of the XPS spectrum can be divided into three regions: low binding energy (O1, 530 eV),\nmedium binding energy (O2, 531 eV), and high binding energy\n(O3, 532 eV). The O1 peak is attributed to the bonding between oxygen atoms and metal atoms (Zn, Ga, and In)\nwithout oxygen deficiency.19 Similarly, the O2 peak is related to the oxygen deficient region like VO in the α-IGZO film.31 The O3 peak is associated with the presence of loosely bound oxygen on the surface of the films due to specific species\n(absorbed H2O, O2, and CO3).32 Thus, the relative quantity of VO is expressed by the area ratio of the O2 peak to the total O 1s peak (O2/Ototal). With increasing N/H treatment time from 0 to 200 s, the area ratio of peak O2/Ototal decreases from 32.7% to 25.3%, which indicating that VO can be effectively suppressed by N/H plasma treatment. This result also agrees with the improvement of stability for α-IGZO:N/H TFTs. Furthermore, the N 1s spectra of α-IGZO and α-IGZO:N/H\n(200 s) films were also analyzed, respectively. It can be seen that there is no obvious broad peak in N 1s spectrum of αIGZO film without N/H treatment in Figure 3a. Interestingly,\nthe broad peak was observed after the N/H treatment, which can be deconvoluted to two peaks, one peak at 396.4 eV from NZn bond and the other peak at 398.2 eV from NH bond are shown in Figure 3b. This result is consistent with the previous studies.13 The low binding energy peak at 396.4 eV\nrelated to N ions corresponding to nitrogen and high binding energy peak at 398.2 eV may be derived from H passivated NO\nacceptor.33 Thus, the N 1s spectrum of α-IGZO:N/H (200 s)\nthin film indicated that N and H atoms are successfully incorporated in α-IGZO film. Recently, the theoretical calculations results reveal that H atom in N-doped ZnObased films favorably connected with the NO at an antibond site and the formation of more stable NOH complex bound, and the dissociation of NO−H complexes bound needs activation energy of at least 1.25 eV.28,34 Moreover, the hydrogenation can greatly enhance the binding between NO and VZn, 35 subsequently forming (NOHVZn) more stable complex bound than (NOVZn) in N doped ZnO-based films.35,36 And also, the evidence of NH complex existing in ZnO-based films in deed has been found.37 The above results could indicate that the N/H plasma treatment passivated many defects and formation of stable NH complex resulting in improvement electrical properties of α-IGZO TFTs.\nIn order to further investigate the effect of N/H plasma treatment on the interface quality of α-IGZO TFTs, the LFN\nwas measured for α-IGZO TFTs with different N/H plasma treatment times of 0, 100, 200, and 300 s in linear operation at VDS = 1 V, respectively. A group of LFN noise plots measured with the gate voltage VGS stepped from weak to strong inversion and linear region of the TFTs (VGS − Vth = 3 V and VDS = 1 V) in Figure 4a (the LFN spectrum data of 100 s is not shown). The standard method is Hooge's empirical relationship by the following:38,39\n$$S_{\\mathrm{ID}}={\\frac{A I_{\\mathrm{D}}^{a}}{f^{\\beta}}}$$\nACS Applied Materials & Interfaces Research Article\nwhere SID is the current noise spectral density, f is the frequency, ID is the current through the device channel, and A is the noise amplitude. The exponent α and β are ideally close to 2 and 1, respectively. Therefore, the measured normalized drain-current noise spectral density (SID/ID\n2) fits well to the 1/f β noise theory (the f is ranging from 5 to 1000 Hz) and the SID/\n2 is good agreement with classical 1/f noise theory (the β is ranging from 0.95 to 1.07) for all devices under all bias condition in Figure 4a. It is clear that the SID/ID\n2 of αIGZO:N/H device was decreased compared with the α-IGZO\ndevice, indicating that the average trap density within the device active channel region is decreased. From the study of 1/f noise in metal oxide TFTs for the past few decades, two mechanisms have been generally considered to explain the origin of 1/f noise in metal oxide TFTs, namely, carrier number fluctuation (CNF) and correlated mobility fluctuation (CMF).40,41 In CMF theory, the observed 1/f noise in the conductance is caused by fluctuations in the mobility of the free carriers in the conducting channel of the metal oxide TFTs.40,41 Moreover, in CNF theory, the 1/f noise is caused by generation−\nrecombination noise in the electron transitions between the conduction band of the channel material and the traps in the oxide layer.40−42 One method of finding the dominant mechanism of 1/f noise is to investigate the dependence of SID/ID\n2 on gate over drive voltages (VGS − Vth)−m at a fixed frequency.42,43 Generally, a slope of m = −2 indicates that CNF\nin the dielectric/channel interface region is the main origin of the generated LFNs, whereas a slope of m = −1 indicates that CMF is their main origin of 1/f noise, respectively.41−44 In order to verify origin of the LFN, SID/ID\n2 is measured at f = 20 Hz, VDS = 1 V, and (VGS − Vth) ranges from 1 to 5 V in Figure 4b. The slopes of the all curves corresponding to the α-IGZO (black), α-IGZO:N/H (200 s) (red) and α-IGZO:N/H (300 s)\n(blue) device are all around m ≈ −2. According to the established LFN theory, a slope of m ≈ −2 indicated that the main source of LFN can be attributed to the CNF, which is caused by the tunneling of free-charge carriers into oxide traps at the SiO2/α-IGZO interface.40−43 Moreover, the information on the dominant noise mechanism can also be obtained by the input-referred noise spectral density (SVG). As shown in Figure 4c, the SVG = SID/gm 2 at f = 20 Hz has negligible dependence on gate-voltage overdrive for all devices, which further confirm that CNF cause SVG to be independent of (VGS − Vth).42,43 Furthermore, according to the CNF model, the effective average interfacial trap density (Nt) could be obtained from the SVG.\n45 For a fair comparison between the α-IGZO and the αIGZO:N/H TFTs, the Nt can be extracted using the following relationship:45,46\n$$\\mathbf{\\omega}={\\frac{q^{2}k T\\mathbf{N}_{t}}{W L\\gamma f C_{\\mathrm{ox}}^{2}}}$$\n$$({\\boldsymbol{\\hat{s}}})$$\nwhere q is the elementary electron charge, f is the noise frequency, kT is the thermal energy, and Cox is the gate dielectric capacitance per unit area. Finally, γ is the tunneling attenuation coefficient of the electron wave function within the SiO2 dielectric. Here, the γ can be further described by the following:47,48\n$${\\sqrt{2m^{*}\\Phi_{\\mathrm{it}}}}$$\nwhere m* is the electron effective mass in SiO2 dielectric, h is the Planck's constant, and Φit is the tunneling barrier height for SiO2/α-IGZO interface. The lowest Nt for the α-IGZO:N/H\nTFTs can be attributed to the lowest SVG because we used the same gate oxide thickness (Cox). It is found that the Nt of αIGZO:N/H device can be significantly reduced compared with α-IGZO TFT device, which are calculated to be 3.5 × 1019 cm−3/eV and 5.6 × 1018 cm−3/eV for α-IGZO TFTs and αIGZO:N/H (200 s) TFTs. The Nt was in good agreement with Dit estimated from SS in the α-IGZO TFTs and α-IGZO:N/H\nTFTs, as shown in Figure 4d and Table 1. However, the excessive N/H (300 s) plasma treatment can generate more interstitial defects rather than passivate trap density at the SiO2/α-IGZO interface, thus inducing high noise level and high Nt, which can lead to the degradation of electrical performances of α-IGZO:N/H (300 s) device. On the basis of the above XPS\nand LFN results, the proper amount of N/H incorporation could effectively reduce the trap density at the SiO2/α-IGZO\ninterface and passivate the VO related defects of the α-IGZO\nTFTs, which could be responsible for the improvement in electrical performance and reliability of the α-IGZO:N/H\n4. Conclusions\nThis work investigated the effects of N/H plasma treatment on the electrical characteristics of α-IGZO TFTs. The results indicated that the electrical properties were significantly improved, including the μFE of 45.3 cm2/(V s), Ion/Ioff of 108, Vth of 1.7 V, and SS of 0.21 V/decade. In addition, the αIGZO:N/H (200 s) devices have also shown better stability than that of the α-IGZO devices. According to the XPS results, these characteristics are mainly attributed to the N/H plasma treatment, which could effectively passivate the VO defects in the α-IGZO film. Furthermore, on the basis of low-frequency noise analysis, the SID/ID\n2 of α-IGZO:N/H devices are decreased compared with the α-IGZO device, which indicated that the average trap density near the α-IGZO/SiO2 interface is reduced by the N/H plasma treatment. Overall, the αIGZO:N/H devices with high electrical performance and reliability could be used for various applications in future high resolution flat panel displays.\n- ASSOCIATED CONTENT\n*S Supporting Information\nThe transfer linear curves of the α-IGZO and αIGZO:N/H TFTs.

By virtue of their flexible substrate compatibility and transparency, amorphous metal oxide semiconductor (AOS) thin film transistors (TFTs) are being explored in emerging flexible/transparent technologies. However, rapid advances in such technologies requires the development of high-performance thin film transistors, which can be fabricated at low processing temperatures. In this review paper we discuss the recent progress made in n-type semiconductor TFTs activated at low temperatures both on rigid and flexible substrates with a focus on the replacement of conventional high temperature annealing. Several low temperature processing approaches that have been reported in both vacuum deposited and solution processed n-type metal oxide semiconductor based thin film transistors are evaluated, with an emphasis on some novel techniques which can effectively modulate the electronic property of the n-type metal oxide semiconductor systems at low temperatures. The final part of this review draws conclusions and discusses the outlook for future research efforts in achieving low temperature activated high performance n-type TFTs.\n1. Introduction\nb.*School of Materials Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University,* \n> 350 ℃) for optimum film formation, densification, and impurity removal. Oxide semiconductor thin films formed at low temperatures exhibit poor electrical characteristics due to the presence of numerous defects and impurities and the high temperature post-deposition annealing aids in modulating their electronic properties for the fabrication of high performance thin film transistors (3,6). Recently significant effort has been expended to explore new material compositions as well as novel processing methodologies to improve the electronic transport in the metal oxide, and to lower the processing temperature for compatibility with low-cost and flexible polymer substrate materials (8). New alternatives for activation/improvement of oxide thin film transistor's properties are also being concurrently explored, with research focus currently leaning towards oxygen vacancy modulation of MO semiconductors (3,8). Metal oxide semiconductors for thin film transistors has been reviewed previously (3,8,11,12). Among these, majority of the reviews that focus on low temperature \nprocessing, dealt with solution processed metal oxide systems. In this review, we discuss low temperature fabrication of metal oxide TFTs \n(≤ 300℃) using both solution and vacuum processing. In addition to reviewing the prevalent low temperature methods such as photoactivation, microwave and combustion synthesis etc. which have been reviewed previously (3,8,11,12). we also explore and analyze more unconventional athermal methods such as capping layer and electric field driven approaches which have been recently reported to result in high performance devices. Electronic structure modulation: In 1996 Hosono et al. proposed a multicomponent combination of cations for the design of an amorphous metal oxide semiconductor. The selected cations possess conduction bands derived from large ionic-radius, spherically symmetric 4s, 5s, or 6s electron orbitals from the portion of the periodic table shown inset of Fig. 1. Since then there have been many metal oxide semiconductor trials with the most prevalent ones involving Indium (In), tin (Sn), zinc (Zn), and gallium (Ga) as AOS design starting points. This is because their binary oxides such as indium oxide (In2O3), tin-oxide (SnO2), and zinc oxide (ZnO) are the three most commonly used transparent conducting oxides \n(TCOs)(13). These materials have wide band gaps (Eg > 3 eV), high transparency (> 80%) and high electrical conductivity. Additionally, they retain relatively high electron mobility even in the amorphous state and are hence widely considered as the base materials for amorphous MO semiconductors. The small effective masses and corresponding relatively high mobility of these oxides are valued for both TCO and AOS applications. However, these materials suffer from very high carrier concentrations, non-uniformity and high leakage currents. These issues were addressed by mixing two or more metal cations to form ternary or quaternary systems, to boost the formation of amorphous films, thereby reducing the carrier concentration and decreasing the grain boundaries present in polycrystalline samples (10). For MO TFTs to exhibit a low Ioff, high Ion and stable performance, it is imperative to limit the semiconductor carrier concentration to a low level, preferably < 1017 cm-3(10)(14). \nIn the case of binary or ternary MO systems, moderate n-type doping can be controlled by the cation/anion non-stoichiometry or process optimization. An alternative approach is to introduce an extra component, such as a carrier suppressor (a dopant). Primary requirements for dopants are the following: (i) M-O bond strength should be higher than that of the matrix metal ion (ii) Dopant size should be smaller than the matrix host metal ion; else the dopant will act as a defect site (15) (iii) High Lewis acid strength, since it results in higher mobility via suppression of scattering by oxygen interstitials (16) (iv) An appropriate concentration of dopant to ensure accurate control of the oxygen vacancies without a significant decrease in the mobility. Various elements such as Gallium (Ga), Tungsten (W), Silicon (Si), Hafnium (Hf), Zirconium (Zr), Titanium (Ti), Aluminum (Al) and Tantalum (Ta) have been studied and shown to exhibit carrier suppressor behavior (16). Therefore, the cation composition can be modified to improve the stability of transparent metal oxide (TMO) TFTs under bias and illumination stress. In addition, incorporation of nitrogen in the binary systems also appears to suppress the growth of indium oxide and zinc oxide resulting in nanostructured phase(14). The substitution of an oxygen anion with a nitrogen anion effectively passivates the VO sites in ZnO and In2O3 by eliminating the oxygen deficiency related deep levels near the valence band maximum thereby improving the photo bias stability (14,17). Processing *methods:* Electronic and optoelectronic devices based on metal oxides usually comprise of thin films deposited on appropriate substrates. High-quality metal oxide network can be obtained by \nManuscript Accepted Chemistry Frontiers \nFigure 2.

These techniques permit the growth of high-quality uniform thin films with atomic layer precision (18). Solution processing is another widely adopted method for fabricating MO films for TFT applications and is appealing in terms of low cost, scalability and compatibility with high throughput manufacturing. Fig. 2d illustrates the stages involved in solution processing, namely, the synthesis of the solution, deposition of the solution on substrates followed by pyrolysis or condensation for MO formation. The evolution of the film as it proceeds through these stages are also illustrated. The various deposition techniques employed, such as spin-coating, inkjet printing and spray coating are presented in Fig. 2e. Nanoparticle route and precursor route are two widely adopted approaches for synthesis of the solution for metal oxide film formation. Nanoparticle route is a straightforward approach wherein a metal oxide nanoparticle dispersion in appropriate solvent is deposited on the substrate. The evolution of metal oxide films deposited through the precursor route is depicted in Fig. 2f, where the metal cation complexes formed by the solvation of metal precursors, undergo hydrolysis and condensation reactions to form metal-oxide (M-O) network. Although nanoparticle approach seems advantageous in terms of low temperature processing, the inherent porous nature affects the film quality and the particle boundaries limit charge transport which severely impairs the device characteristics of the fabricated TFTs(19)(20)(21). In comparison, the precursor route aids in the formation of denser, grain boundary-free MO films with lower surface roughness. However, it needs to be noted that high temperature anneal is generally a prerequisite for the formation of high-quality metal oxide films for the effective and complete hydrolysis, condensation and densification reactions which are imperative for the formation of M-O-M network and for the removal of organic residues.\n| Metal oxide TFTs on rigid substrates   |

The table also lists a selection of MO TFTs fabricated on flexible substrates.

Low-Temperature Route For N-Type Metal Oxide Semiconductors\nPrevious studies have proven that the MO films annealed at high temperature (> 400 °C) exhibited good TFT device characteristics. However, low-temperature processing (≤ 350 °C) is indispensable for realizing AOS TFTs for flexible electronic applications and a low thermal budget post deposition anneal (PDA) process is required to minimize the production cost. In this context conventional thermal annealing (CTA), which has been generally adopted for the PDA process, is disadvantageous in terms of the duration and high thermal budget required. Herein we discuss the various approaches reported, broadly divided into physical and chemical routes to reduce the processing temperature for the fabrication of metal oxide based TFTs. \n2.1 Physical Routes For The Reduction Of Process Temperature 2.1.1 High Pressure Annealing\nHigh pressure annealing (HPA), has been recently reported as a promising alternative to CTA for the formation of high-quality metal oxide films. HPA is effective in the activation of sputtered films, as in the case of IGZO reported by Kim et al. (110). The mechanism of activation by employing N2 and O2 high pressure activation is illustrated in Fig. 3a. Here, the temperature necessary for activation was reduced from 300 to 100°C with the incorporation of HPA in N2 and O2 gases, where the kinetic energy of the gas molecules provide the activation energy required, while the incorporation of O2 gas provides the additional benefit of elevating the metal oxide construction by ensuring sufficient ns metal orbital overlap for efficient charge transport while simultaneously reducing the electron trap density at lower pressure as evident in Fig. 3b. This results in TFTs with higher bias stress stability and higher mobility (~11 cm2 V1 s\n-1) at a low temperature of 100°C compared to TFTs annealed at 300°C. In the case of solution processed metal oxide films, HPA requires lower fabrication temperature compared to CTA methods \nManuscript Accepted Chemistry Frontiers \nas it reduces the Gibbs free energy and decomposition temperature for the formation of metal oxide network, with minimal organic residues (111). In addition, employing HPA also produces denser MO films due to the drastic reduction of porosity, a bane, especially for low temperature solution processed MO films (Fig. 3). Definitive work on HPA annealing has been done by Kim et al. and in 2012 they demonstrated a solution processed IZO TFT on polyimide (PI) \nsubstrate subjected to 1MPa HPA in O2 atmosphere at 220°C (112). \nThe reduced bulk defects and charge traps provided by HPA also resulted in more stable devices as indicated by the positive bias stress with the lowest Vth shift obtained for 1MPa O2 HPA. In addition to activation, HPA can also be utilized as a post treatment for activated films, as the process can assist in improving the electrical stability of TFTs through defect passivation and enhanced densification of metal oxide films. However, HPA requires long duration of treatment (~1hr) as well as specialized O2/N2 environment at high pressure conditions which could hamper widespread industrial application. Though promising as a CTA replacement, the scalability issues of utilizing HPA for metal oxide layer activation for TFT applications needs to be addressed as a facile integration of this activation method into a roll-to-roll production process flow will be challenging.\n2.1.2 Microwave Annealing Approach\n The Royal Society of Chemistry 20xx ., 2013, 00 | 7 Microwave assisted annealing (MWA) technique has attracted significant attention due to the volumetric heating involved, that directly and uniformly delivers thermal energy to the MO film, while enabling low thermal budget and fast processing, primarily due to the short exposure duration (70,113–117). In principle, Microwaves compromise with rapid change in electric and magnetic field as well (Fig. 4a). The microwave will heat any material with mobile electric charges such as ions in dielectrics. As example, polar solvents are heated due to interaction of the time varying fields with the polar molecules. As a result, the polar molecules tend to vibrate with the fields and lose energy in collisions. Charges such as ions or electrons within the semiconducting and conducting materials constitute electric current in response to the field and resulting loss in energy through resistive heating and dielectric relaxation of the materials. In particular, the resistive heating/ohmic loss dominates at lower frequencies (< 10 GHz). Thus MWA process has been shown to provide a lower temperature process that results in good activation (118). In 2010 T. Jun et al., demonstrated comparison between hot plate annealing and microwave annealing effect on the performance of solution processed ZnO TFT. The microwave-annealing for 30 min at 140℃ of ZnO TFTs on rigid substrate showed better field effect mobility of 1.7 cm2 V-1 s\n-1 compared to hot plate annealed (0.32 cm2 V-1 s\n-1) ones. Additionally, transistors on flexible substrates exhibited device characteristics of 0.57 cm2 V-1 s\n-1. Microwave annealing reduces the grain boundaries due to increase in size of the ZnO nanoparticles and leads to improved transport properties of the charge carries, resulting in better performance of the TFT (113). In 2014, S. Park et al., also investigated the effect of microwave annealing on sputtered ZnO TFT (Fig. 4b). The microwave irradiation of 2.45 GHz at 700 W for 15 min increased the field effect mobility from 0.2 to 1.5 cm2 V-1 s\n-1 and on/off current ratio from 36.5 to 6.9 x 106. The microwave irradiation induces a large number of oxygen vacancies as confirmed by photoluminescence, resulting in enhanced mobilities (70). H.-C Cheng also demonstrated microwave annealed solution processed flexible a-IZO TFT(119) with a mobility of 6.9 cm2 V-1 s\n-1, and ION/IOFF ratio greater than 106(Fig. 4d). In 2014, Lee et al.,\ndemonstrated a high reliable microwave assisted annealed a-IGZO thin-film transistors to be used as biosensors. The microwave irradiation of 2.45 GHz at 1000 W for 10 min improved the TFT \nperformance (µFE = 9.51 cm2 V-1 s\n-1, Vth = 0.99 V, ION/IOFF = 1.18 x 108), \ncompared to furnace-annealed a-IGZO TFTs at 400 °C for 30 min (µFE = 4.51 cm2 V-1 s\n-1, Vth = 4.85 V, ION/IOFF = 3.38 x 107). The microwave annealing eliminated the defect density inside the a-IGZO film and improved the device performance. In addition, the microwaveassisted annealed TFT displayed excellent sensing properties in terms of pH sensitivity, reliability, chemical stability when employed as a transducer in an extended-gate ion-sensitive field-effect transistor biosensor (114). In 2015, K.-W. Jo and his co-workers developed ultra-thin (5 nm) SnO2 TFTs. The performance of the TFT was significantly improved with field effect mobility of 35.4 cm2 V-1 s\n/ IOFF = 4.48 x 107 under microwave irradiation of 2.45 GHz at 1000 W \nfor 15 min assisted annealing as compared to CTA (400 ℃, 30 min) \nTFTs (µFE = 20.3 cm2 V-1 s\n-1, ION/IOFF = 2.76 x 107) as depicted in Fig. 4e. \nThis result is due to enhancement of crystallinity and elimination of defects in SnO2 TFTs by the microwave irradiation (115). In 2019, Shin reported the microwave-assisted annealing of various compositional ratios of sputtered IGZO films in O2 ambient (Fig. 4c). The temperature of the a-IGZO TFTs samples was measured by an infrared thermometer during the MW-PDA process and observed to be 399.6 ℃ on average. However CTA at 400℃ yielded poorer performance since MWA results in lowered defect densities (Dit, Nt)\nand sub-gap density of state (DOS) (116). Compared to conventional annealing techniques, the novel microwave annealing techniques facilitate low temperature activation of devices on flexible substrate and may be promising for roll to roll processing of flexible electronics (117). In addition, microwave annealing is also more efficient to improve the electrical performance of IGZO TFTs than the other low temperature annealing processes such as electron beam (e-beam) radiation and low-temperature hot-plate annealing. It is shown that, the IGZO TFTs treated by microwave annealing exhibit a typical field effect mobility of 11.3 cm2/Vs and a threshold voltage of -1.54 V. \nWhile, the TFTs subjected to e-beam annealing exhibit a slightly lower mobility of 7.40 cm2/Vs and a more negative threshold voltage of -1.95 V. The poor performance is attributed to structural damage during e-beam radiation, which generate electrical defect levels within the forbidden band gap of IGZO (120). However, the lowtemperature hot-plate annealing resulted in comparable device performance with microwave annealing- both microwave annealing and low-temperature hot-plate annealing increased the mobility from 12.3 cm2/Vs (as-deposited) to ∼19 cm2/Vs in microwave and hot plate annealing state. However, the negative shift in threshold voltage with microwave annealing (from 0.23V to −2.86V) is smaller than that with low-temperature hotplate annealing (to −9V) due to suppression of oxygen vacancies formation (121). Microwave annealing offers various advantages such as rapid and effective heating, low temperature processing, and suppression of unnecessary diffusion to the adjacent material. However, there may be challenges in terms of safety and variations associated with specific sample size and shape may also need to be managed. \n2.1.3 Photo Activation\nPhoto activation is the most prevalent substitute for thermal annealing of MO films, especially for solution processed MO films, where the light source provides photothermal energy sufficient to initiate the chemical conversion for the formation of metal oxide network. Photoactivation has been demonstrated with deep UV irradiation as a viable annealing technique for the formation of MO films such as IZO, IGZO and IO. Recently, there have been reports on the use of other sources including infrared and intense pulsed light for activation of metal oxide film for TFT applications (122)(123)(124). Deep UV (DUV) irradiation provides sufficient energy for the decomposition, condensation and densification reactions and results in MO films with properties comparable to high temperature CTA MO films (mechanism of activation is illustrated in Fig. 5a). In 2012, Park et al., demonstrated the use of DUV irradiation, specifically suitable for nitrate precursors (compared to acetate or chloride precursors) by virtue of their stronger absorption of UV\nManuscript Accepted Chemistry Frontiers Inorganic Please do not adjust margins\nManuscript Accepted Chemistry Frontiers \nirradiation(125). Though there is inherent heating to around 150°C during photoactivation, which may aid in the removal of organic residues, this is insufficient as an independent thermal energy source for the formation of M-O-M network, as is evident in Fig. 5b. Though initially demonstrated in inert atmosphere, UV photochemical activation was shown to be equally effective in ambient conditions as reported by Mathews et al (126). Here, the mid-UV range source with emission spectra of 200 to 300 nm, corresponding to 398.48 to 598.2 kJ/mol was used to ensure decomposition of precursors and initiate the condensation and densification for the formation of high quality InO and IZO films and TFT mobilities of ~ 30 cm2V-1 s\n−1. On the other hand, infrared irradiation activation, relies on the rapid photo thermal effect provided by IR irradiation (Fig. 5c). IR irradiation increases the free energy of the precursor system, elevating it to a metastable state, which reduces the activation energy necessary for the formation of oxide network. Thus, in comparison to conventional thermal annealing, with adequate duration of IR irradiation, lower temperature is sufficient for complete precursor decomposition and metal oxide network formation. This results in metal oxide films with higher carrier concentration and lower defect density due to improved interface quality and higher oxygen vacancy generation. Wang et al., reported that IGZO TFT fabricated by IR irradiation (induced temperature of 230°C) in ambient environments could achieve a mobility 60 cm2 V-1 s\n−1, an ION/IOFF ratio of 106 (122). This was a marked improvement in mobility compared to conventional high temperature (450°C) annealed IGZO TFT. The higher M-O bond content and oxygen vacancies and lower M-OH content and trap density demonstrated by the IR irradiated MO layers in comparison to thermally annealed counterparts are indicative of high quality, low defect content metal oxide layer with good interface quality which manifests in the high stability exhibited during positive bias stress test (Fig. 5d). Unlike UV annealing, IR irradiation is also effective with chloride precursors (which typically require > 400°C anneal). Xia et al., have reported the use of IR irradiation to form both the AlOx solution processed dielectric and the IO film employing chloride precursors (123). The resultant AlOx dielectric demonstrated properties comparable to vacuum processed counterparts with capacitance of 158 nFcm−2 and a small leakage current (5.4 Å~10−8 Acm−2) by virtue of the low defect density of IR irradiated films. The IO TFTs exhibited a mobility of around 33 cm2 V-1 s\n![10_image_0.png](10_image_0.png)\nincidental temperature on substrate during IR radiation is higher than that generated during UV irradiation, which may make it unsuitable for certain flexible substrates. The primary advantage of other novel photoactivation sources such as intense pulse light is the sub second exposure duration necessary for the activation of the metal oxide films which ensures selective heating of the precursor film. Intense pulsed light (IPL) using xenon light source was used for the  photo activation for solution processed MO films such as IGZO\nand  In 2 O 3 TFT and In 2 O 3 /ZnO heterojunction for TFT applications\n(124)(127). It was also used for the activation of sputtered ZnON\nfilms, where a 20ms pulse of 40 J/cm² resulted in a TFT devices with high stress stability and a mobility of around 48 cm²V -1 s −1 (128). Even though the incidental heating can be as high at 1000 °C during exposure in the case of xenon flash lamp, the sub second (500 μ s-20 ms) exposure duration ensures negligible heating of the substrate\n2.1.4 Capping Layers\nIn AOS TFTs, electron mobility is sensitive to defect states and therefore the mobility is expected to increase significantly by reducing the defect density. Metallic capping layers overlaid between S/D contacts reduces drain current-crowding and the carrier scattering effect due its lower value of sheet resistance (131). Additionally, the proposed devices effectively prevent the adsorption/desorption reaction of ambient oxygen and hydrogen molecules on the surface. This structure has shown high µFE as well as enhanced stability simply by adopting a metal capping layer(132).\nIn 2012 H.-W. Zan et al., demonstrated an amorphous IndiumGallium-Zinc Oxide (a-IGZO) TFT with double capping layer of metal calcium/ aluminium at its back channel (Fig. 6a). The mobility of the TFT increased from 12 to 160 cm2 V-1 s\n-1 after deposition of the capping layer of Ca/Al. The Ca layer (150 μm long, 35 nm thick) deposited on the back channel of these devices served as the mobility enhancement capping layer while the Al layer deterred the formation of CaO, Ca(OH)2 and CaCO3 by absorption of oxygen, water Manuscript Accepted and carbon dioxide respectively from the atmosphere. The Ca atoms close to the IGZO layer reacts with weakly bonded oxygen atoms of the Zn-O, In-O, and Ga-O to form Ca-O bonds and enhances the field effect mobility of the device due to reduction of defect density (132). In 2015 Z. Wang et al., successfully demonstrated facile fabrication of a CMOS inverter at low temperature by using single-step deposition of the tin mono-oxide channel layer (Fig. 6b). Selective deposition of a copper oxide capping layer on top of the tin monooxide, provided additional oxygen to form an n-type SnO2 phase at temperature as low as 190℃ in air. The phase transition from SnO to SnO2 typically occurs at temperature above 300℃. However, in the case of bilayer system this can occur at temperatures as low as 190℃\n(133). In 2017, Y. Shin et al., showed low-temperature crystallization of IGZO using a tantalum (Ta) catalytic layer. The field-effect mobility was significantly boosted to 54.0 cm2 V-1 s\n-1 for the IGZO device with a metal induced polycrystalline channel formed at 300 °C as compared to 18.1 cm2 V-1 s\n-1 for the non- catalysed IGZO TFT. A 20 nm thick Ta thin film, serving as the crystallization catalytic layer, was sputtered selectively through a shadow mask on top of the active layer between the source and drain electrodes. Improvement in the device mobility occurred because Ta acted as a catalyst to break weak IGZO bonds, and these broken bonds within IGZO rearrange to form crystallized regions during thermal annealing (134). In 2019, T. \nKim and co-workers also investigated novel TaOx encapsulation to enhance performance of ZnO:N thin-film transistors (Fig. 6c). A 10 nm thick Ta film was selectively deposited and annealed at 200 °C for 1 h under O2 ambient. Ta capped TFTs (µFE = 89.4 cm2 V-1 s\n0.45 V, ION/OFF = 8.6 x 108) showed improved performance when compared to uncapped TFTs (µFE = 36.2 cm2 V-1 s\n-1, Vth = 1.28 V, ION/OFF\n= 2.9 x 108) by scavenging and passivation effects of the TaOx film which occurred due to facile elevation of the quasi-Fermi level as a result of a lower acceptor-like trap state distribution and large carrier concentration value. Smaller number of sub-gap states near the conduction band (CB) minimum and a higher net carrier density for the TaOx-capped devices, increased the fermi energy level toward the CB edge under thermal equilibrium conditions, thus leading to efficient band conduction and fast carrier transport under the onstate condition (135). Various metal capping layers have been shown to improve device performance and stability, however, the additional patterning steps required for capping layer increases the manufacturing cost. It also lowers the optical transparency of transparent electronics due to reduced aperture ratio (136).\n2.1.5 Ionic Liquid Approach/ Or Electric Field Driven Approaches\nOwing to capability to generate extremely high electrostatic field \n(~50MV/mm-1), ionic liquid (IL) gating has been extensively used to investigate electrostatic effects on fundamental physics problems in strongly correlated systems. These extremely high electric fields can extract or intercalate ionic species out of or into solids. Thus manipulation of the oxygen vacancy concentration via IL gating is a promising approach to tune the electrical properties, mitigating the need for high temperature annealing (137,138). In 2019, Kulkarni et al., demonstrated athermal activation in IWO channel TFT via an Please do not adjust margins\n![12_image_0.png](12_image_0.png)\nManuscript Accepted symbols)(Reproduced from ref. 127) (b) Dual-side gated a-IGZO TFT on a silicon substrate used for field induced activation testing and transfer characteristics of IL gate activated flexible IGZO TFT( Reproduced from ref. 125)\n Chemistry Frontiers \nelectrolyte-gating approach. Room temperature, RF sputtered IWO \nthin films (thickness ~ 7 nm) on SiO2/Si wafers and on flexible substrate were activated by EMIM TFSI (1-Ethyl-3methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) ionic liquids. This technique facilitated activation of non-functioning TFT to a working transistor with mobility of µFE = 7.1 cm2 V-1 s\n(back gate) and ionic-gated transistors with µFE = 105.4 cm2 V-1 s\n-1 on flexible substrates at room temperature. Modulation of the local electronic structure of the channel by migrating oxygen species across the semiconductor–dielectric interface generated enough carriers for charge transport and for activation of oxygencompensated thin films (137). In 2016, Pudasaini et al.,\ndemonstrated IL gating of a-IGZO with 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium bis (trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide ([Hmim][TFSI]) ionic liquid to modulate oxygen concentration in the channel layer and tune the threshold voltage (Vth). The ionic liquid was dispensed to cover the a-IGZO active area and auxiliary gate electrode as shown in Fig. 7b. The strong electric field induced by the electrical-double layer (EDL) formed at the interface between the IL and a-IGZO surface was responsible for the extraction of oxygen in the IGZO layer. A relatively large ON current (≈50 μA) with a ION/OFF = 105 and µFE = 23.2 cm2 V-1 s\n-1 was achieved for the athermal activated IL side gated a-IGZO \nTFT(138). In 2013 J. Jeong et al., showed an electrolyte gating approach which suppresses the metal-to-insulator transition and stabilizes the metallic phase to temperatures below 5 kelvin for epitaxial thin films of VO2, even after the ionic liquid was completely removed. These large electrostatic fields have been shown to be capable of moving ions in/out of other oxides as well (VO2, SrTiO3)\n(139). In 2011 K. Ueno et al., demonstrated an unexpected superconducting phase in KTaO3 by ionic gating approach. EDL \ntransistor devices were fabricated on KTaO3 single crystals with an ionic liquid (as shown in Fig. 7a) with high ION/IOFF > 1×105. After biasing the ionic gate, Electrostatic carrier doping could induce superconductivity in KTaO3 (140). This novel oxygen vacancy modulation techniques facilitate low temperature activation of devices on flexible substrate. However, modulation of oxygen vacancies is still debated. As some researchers continue to suspect the changes to be related to movements of other ions (H+, OH-) \npresent in ionic liquid (141). For electronic gating on flexible substrates, having a liquid on top of the device may not be feasiblethus researchers are trying to make ionic gels which are mainly ABA \ntype tri-block copolymers which consists of ionic liquid-phobic A blocks and ionic liquid-philic B blocks. Ionic liquids can absorb water and could also induce chemical reaction on prolonged exposure, hence care should be taken to minimize contact with water/humidity and other reactive elements.\n2.2 Chemical Routes For Reduction Of Process Temperature\nFor solution-processed metal oxide films deposited from precursor solutions, the as-deposited thin films consists of metal cation complexes, hydroxides, oxides etc. During the subsequent high temperature anneal, the M-O-M network is formed through condensation process and complete anion decomposition and organic residue removal. If insufficient thermal energy is available for the consumption of hydroxides and the decomposition of anions, the M-O-M structure formation and oxygen vacancy formation is affected and excess trap sites are generated, leading to degraded TFT device characteristics.\n2.2.1 Precursor And Solvent Selection\nFor the precursor route of metal oxide film formation for MO thin film transistors, the choice of precursor and solvent plays a vital role on the structural and electrical properties of the resultant metal oxide film. Figure of merits of a TFT such as the mobility, subthreshold swing and threshold voltage are predominantly influenced by the physical properties of the films such as, M-O, MOH and oxygen vacancy content, density, defect concentration, presence of impurities etc and these are in-turn dependent on the precursors and solvent utilized. Of the various metal precursors available, chlorides, acetates and nitrates have been widely adopted for the formation of metal oxide films (142). A comprehensive study has been conducted by Kim et al, to investigate and analyze the effect of precursors and solvent on MO TFTs (143). The mobility and the threshold voltage of the fabricated MO TFTs are influenced by type of precursor and type of solvent respectively (Fig. 8a). Analytical studies proved that precursor type affected the trap density and also the band mobility, which is an indication of s orbital overlap, while the solvent, which determines the metal-ion complex formed in the precursor solution, affected the deep level traps, dependent on the number of metal interstitials. Of the various precursors, nitratebased MO-films demonstrated the highest field-effect mobility and lowest trap density, while use of acetonitrile as the solvent lead to the highest threshold voltage. XPS investigations corroborated the findings and illustrate that the nitrate-based films display the lowest M-OH content, resulting in reduced trap density and largest M-O to M-OH bond area ratio, resulting in highest s orbital overlap. The precursor type was also found to affect the density of the film formed and hence the mobility, by virtue of the volume of the decomposed ions and atoms in the precursors. Nitrates also yielded MO films with highest density while chlorides by virtue of their inherent defects yielded MO films with the lowest density. Among the various metal precursors used such as chlorides, acetates and nitrates, the latter also has the weakest anion complexation, which ensures complete anion decomposition at lower temperatures (144). Use of nitrate precursors thus provides an approach to reduce the thermal energy required for the formation of high-quality MO films with reduced hydrates and other M-O-M network disrupting impurities by virtue of anions capable of lower temperature decomposition, as is evident from the thermogravimetric studies (Fig. 8b). Metal alkoxides are a class of precursors, which afford the formation of metal oxide films at low temperatures in the presence of an aqueous catalyst or in an aqueous environment. H. Sirringhaus et al., have demonstrated a solgel on chip process using indium alkoxide cluster and zinc-bismethoxyethoxide in which an *insitu* process utilizing a controlled amount of water vapor to facilitate the hydrolyses on the surface of the spin coated film, resulting in metal-oxide film formation at a low temperature of 230 °C with low M-OH content. The fabricated TFT \nexhibited a mobility of 10 cm2V-1 s\n−1, Von=0V, high Ion/Ioff (108) and low hysteresis with stable, repeatable performance and high operational Chemistry Frontiers Inorganic stability (145). Solution processed MO TFTs typically employ 2methoxy ethanol or similar alcohol-based solvents for precursor solution. Recently, water has emerged as a contender by virtue of its ability to form carbon residue-free films at low processing temperature (146)(147)(66). Ionic species dissociation is promoted by the high polarity and high dielectric constant (~80) of the aqueous solvent and by acting as a sigma donor, resulting in the formation of hexaaqua complexes as shown in Fig. 8d. Water, when used for the fabrication of both Al2O3 dielectric and In2O3 films, resulted in TFTs with mobility of ~38 cm2V-1 s\n−1 and Ion/Ioff of 107 at a processing temperature of 250°C (148). The duration and temperature at which aqueous precursors are processed before spin-coating also exhibits significant impact on the MO film formed. According to Park et al., precursors retained at 70°C for longer durations (12-72h), have a higher concentration of dissociated cations which results in higher concentration of hexaaqua metal ion complexes, critical for the low temperature metal oxide formation using aqueous route (59). \n2.2.2 Combustion Synthesis\n![14_image_0.png](14_image_0.png)\nmetal precursors of In(C,H,O,),, InCl,, InF,, and In(NO,),.( Reproduced from ref. 134) (b) Various alkoxide derivatives used for metal oxide formation.( Reproduced from ref. \nStructure of the hexaaqua complexes formed in aqueous solvent and the progress of reactions resulting in the formation of metal oxide films( Reproduced from ref. 135) (e) Com vs conventional synthetic approaches ( Reproduced from ref. 137) (f) Energetics of combustion synthesis for various fuels  ( Reproduced from ref. 142) (g) XPS O1s M-O-M peak to total peak area ratio and film thickness vs. sugar concentration ( Reproduced from ref. 143) (h) Schematic diagram of combustion synthesis via use of metal precursors bear and oxidizer ligands( Reproduced from ref. 144)\n14 | J. Name. , 2012, 00 , 1-3 This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 20xx combustion can proceed at temperatures as low as 100 °C, a higher temperature of around 200-300 °C is required to ensure adequate decomposition of the precursors to ignite the combustion, especially since the nitrates are generally the oxidizers for the combustion synthesis. Due to the thermal ignition required, combustion synthesis is often used in conjunction with CTA, thus requiring a long duration for activation. In addition, the oxygen vacancy generation during the combustion synthesis is determined by the reaction environment, oxygen generated during combustion reaction and post treatment. For high performance metal oxide films, a precise control of the reaction environment during processing is thus imperative (157).\n3. Other Low Temperature Processing Approaches\nPlasma treatment using hydrogen, argon etc have also been used for sputtered MO films to improve the device performance under low temperature processing conditions and have also been extended to solution processed MO TFTs (158)(159).Plasma treatment using hydrogen has been used for the decomposition of residual organic species subsequent to the formation of metal oxide layers. This treatment followed by an oxidation step has been shown to increase the stability of the device while improving the TFT device performance (160). There have recently been reports on the use of NH3 and N2O plasma treatments resulting in improved device performance (161)(162). Other novel techniques include water vapour annealing (163), where the presence of water vapor leads to efficient hydrolysis reaction for solution processed MO films, resulting in higher M-O and lower M-OH concentrations and photo catalytic reactions using TiO2 under UV irradiation for decomposition of organic residues and defect site reduction (164). In addition to these novel methods, a combination of various annealing conditions and techniques have been shown to result in improved performance of MO TFTs. Combining plasma treatment with (a) thermal annealing (165) (b) atmospheric pressure treatment (166) or (c) microwave irradiation(167) has been shown to drastically improve TFT performance.\n4. Conclusions And Outlook\nSignificant research effort is being dedicated to achieving low temperature processing for MO TFTs, thus enabling their widespread application in flexible electronics. Conventional annealing techniques such as high-temperature thermal annealing, rapid thermal annealing, laser annealing etc require high temperature to tune the oxygen vacancy in the metal oxide semiconductor which results in adverse effects on flexible substrates. Replacing the high thermal budget required for such conventional annealing with photochemical, plasma-assisted and microwave annealing techniques are applicable to both vacuum deposited and solution processed MO TFTs. In the case of solution processed MO films, additional avenues are available such as appropriate selection of precursors, solvents and fuel additives for aiding combustion synthesis, reducing the process temperature for the formation of high-quality metal oxide films. However, all these techniques except for laser annealing are nonselective, i.e., all the TFTs on the substrates are affected by the process. If selective annealing is required, a complex number of steps will be required, such as photolithography, to tune the attributes of thin film semiconductor selectively. As discussed in this review, another promising alternative is the athermal oxygen vacancy modulation and defect passivation of the metal oxide film for tailoring the electronic structure, which renders high temperature treatments, typically critical for achieving high performance TFTs, dispensable. Athermal activation using capping layer or ionic liquid paves the way for flexible and transparent electronics. In the ionic liquid gating approach, which is limited to charge modulation and accumulation for ionic liquid TFT, the high electric field of the order of 50 MV/mm present at the interface due to Helmholtz layers can be used to vary the oxygen ions present in the film. The controlled manipulation of oxygen vacancies changes the conductance of film in a precise manner which is of interest for novel applications such as neuromorphic electronics. Such techniques also allow for the selective treatments on individual TFTs within a large substrate. Metal capping layer approach facilitates the decrease of weakly bonded oxygen density or reduction in the defect density by partial crystallization of underlying AOS layer at low temperature. This structure has shown high µFE as well as enhanced stability simply by adopting selective metal capping layer while ensuring reduction in the process temperature as discussed in above sections. Apart from the options discussed in the review, manipulation of the active layer structure is another viable alternative for achieving high performance metal oxide TFT. Hybrid metal oxide-2D TFTs have been investigated, where the addition of high conductivity 2D materials, such as graphene/CNT, in the active layer stack leads to enhanced TFT mobility. Hybrid metal oxide-2D heterostructure and quasi superlattice metal oxide stacks are another class of active layers employed for realizing high mobility TFTs at low processing temperature. According to reports, the ultrathin metal oxide layers that form these active layers enable the manifestation of 2D charge transport phenomenon, while the incorporation of deep fermi level metal oxide in the stack results in higher Ion/Ioff ratio. Compared to initial research studies, effort is now being made to ensure that the methods used for enhanced device performance at lower processing temperatures do not adversely affect the device stability. Metal oxide semiconductors are also highly sensitive to atmosphere, where exposure to moisture and oxygen can affect device stability; an issue which needs to be addressed. As discussed, researchers have reported that using capping layers, such as Al2O3, SiO2, Y2O3, HfO2, ZrO2,TiO2, AHO (Al2O3-\nHfO2 stack) and ATO (Al2O3, TiO2 stack) can improve the stability of oxide semiconductor in air and at higher temperatures. In addition, the scalability and production-line compatibility of the various techniques for reducing the processing temperature of metal oxide semiconductors should also be thoroughly examined. With continued research efforts being deployed in realizing stability, scalability and low temperature processing, metal oxide thin films are the most promising material system for propelling the flexible and transparent electronics into a ubiquitous technology. \nManuscript Accepted Please do not adjust margins\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the funding from the MOE Tier 1 Grants RG 166/16 and the MOE Tier 2 Grant MOE2016-T2-1-100.\nNotes And References\n1.

The improvement is attributed to the effective widening of the energy band, and the reduction of the population of defects and background carriers. \nThin-Film Transistor (TFT); Elevated-Metal Metal-Oxide (EMMO); Wide Bandgap; Indium-Tin-Zinc-Gallium Oxide (ITZGO); Indium-Tin-Zinc Oxide (ITZO). \nAttributed to their relatively higher field-effect mobility (ߤ( and compatible fabrication process with the incumbent amorphoussilicon thin-film transistors (TFTs), metal-oxide (MO) TFTs are being deployed in the back-planes of advanced active-matrix liquid-crystal displays and active-matrix organic light-emitting diode displays –. With the drive to develop displays with larger pixel-counts and higher pixel-densities comes a demand for \"faster\" and \"smaller\" MO TFTs. The intrinsic speed of a transistor is bound by the transit frequency (݂) : \n$\\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{FE}}}{+2l_{\\mathrm{Oy}})}$ ,\nwhere L is the transistor channel length and ܮ is the overlap length between the gate electrode and the source/drain (S/D) \nregions. Clearly, making ݂ higher by increasing ߤ) hence faster transit time) and decreasing L and ܮ) hence smaller capacitance) \nare beneficial for improving circuit speed. \nBoth L and ܮ are dependent on the architecture selected for the MO TFTs. As the edges of the channel region are self-aligned to those of the elevated metal electrodes, the elevated-metal metaloxide (EMMO) architecture offers the shortest L that is limited only by the minimum photolithographically defined separation between the electrodes , . In addition, a bottom-gate, self-aligned EMMO TFT could be realized using a back-side flood exposure technique to minimize ܮ] 7[. \nPartly induced by donor-like defects, high-mobility MO \nsemiconductors often come with higher background carrier concentrations. Since the apparent short-channel effects were reported to sensitively depend on the defects induced in the channel region , the suppression of defects is necessary for developing high-mobility MO TFTs while maintaining good scalability and reliability. In this study, the effects of bandgap engineering  by gallium (Ga) incorporation in the channel region of a high-mobility indium-tin-zinc oxide (ITZO) TFT were investigated. It is shown that the bandgap (ܧ (can be effectively widened and the population of defects in the channel region can be passivated by combining gallium (Ga) incorporation in the channel with an oxidizing thermal treatment. The resulting ITZGO EMMO TFTs exhibit enhanced scalability and reliability without excessive penalty on ߤ. This is desirable for the realization of higher pixel-count and pixel-density displays . \nThe fabrication of an EMMO TFT started with the sputterdeposition and patterning of a 100 nm-thick molybdenum (Mo) \ngate electrode on an oxidized p-type silicon substrate. The gate dielectric consisted of 50-nm thick silicon nitride (SiNx) under 75nm thick silicon oxide (SiOy), both formed at 300 °C in a plasmaenhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) system. A 25 nmthick MO active layer was subsequently deposited at room temperature by sputtering ITZO or co-sputtering of ITZO and Ga2O3 in a radio-frequency magnetron sputtering system (Fig. 1) at a process pressure of 3 mTorr in a mixed atmosphere of oxygen (O2) and argon. The molar ratios of ITZO targets were In2O3:Ga2O3:ZnO = 4:3:6 mol%. The base pressure was ~1 ȝTorr. \nThe MO film was patterned to form the active islands before a 300 nm-thick SiOy etch-stop layer was deposited. Following a thermal treatment at 400 °C for 2 hrs in an O2 atmosphere, the contact areas were opened in an inductively coupled plasma etcher running a sulfur hexafluoride chemistry. The S/D electrodes were made of sputtered and patterned stacks of 300-nm thick aluminum (Al) on 50-nm thick Mo. The overlap between each end of the gate electrode and the corresponding S/D electrode was 4 ȝm. Finally, the conductive S/D regions (Fig. 2) were formed using a thermal treatment at 400 °C in O2 for different durations. The TFTs were electrically characterized using an Agilent 4156C Semiconductor Parameter Analyzer. \n5Hvxowvdqg'Lvfxvvlrq\nBy varying the sputtering power of the different targets, amorphous ITZO and ITZGO films with different compositions were deposited as the active channels of the EMMO TFTs. The atomic ratios of four types of films are summarized in Table I. \n| JDOOLXPLQILOP7\\SHV$%&DQG'   |    |    |    |    |\n|---|----|----|----|----|\n| &RPSRVLWLRQFRQWHQW   | &KDQQHO7\\SH    |    |    |    |\n| A | B  | C  | D  |    |\n| ,Q,Q6Q=Q*D\f\f   | 47 | 40 | 36 | 28 |\n| 6Q,Q6Q=Q*D\f\f   | 25 | 21 | 19 | 18 |\n| =Q,Q6Q=Q*D\f\f   | 28 | 23 | 22 | 19 |\n| *D,Q6Q=Q*D\f\f   | 0  | 16 | 23 | 41 |\n Shown in Figures 3 are the drain current (ܫୢ (vs. gate voltage \n(ܸ ) transfer characteristics of ITZO and ITZGO EMMO TFTs oxidized at 400 °C for 6 hrs with the same ܮ = 20 ȝm and channel width (ܹ) of 100 ȝm at a drain voltage (ܸୢ) of 5 V.

This improvement is attributed to the suppression of the background carrier concentration by the stronger binding between Ga and O to reduce the population of donor-defects in the corresponding channels . \n)LJXUH 7UDQVIHUFXUYHVRI(0027)7VEXLOWRQWKHIRXU W\\SHVRIFKDQQHOVVKRZQLQ7DEOH,\nSummarized in Table II are the electrical parameters of the EMMO TFTs built on the four types of channels shown in Table I. \nThe ߤ) ؠ ܮ݃୫ܹܥ୧ܸୢ) was extracted from the maximum transconductance (݃୫ ) at a low ܸୢ = 0.5 V, where Ci is the gate capacitance per unit area.

This is consistent with the effectiveness of thermal oxidation in reducing the native defect concentration in a MO semiconductor. \n| GLIIHUHQWW\\SHVRIDFWLYHOD\\HUV    |      |     |      |\n|----|------|-----|------|\n| FKDQQHO    | ۴۳ࣆ  |     |      |\n| $FWLYH    | P9GHFDGH\f      | ܖܗࢂ 9\f     |      |\n| ࡿࡿ |      |     |      |\n| FP9V\f    |      |     |      |\n| $    | 35.8 | 186 | í1.8 |\n| %    | 24.3 | 180 | í0.6 |\n| &    | 19.1 | 184 | í0.3 |\n| '    | 1.3  | 195 | 0    |\n7DEOH,,7KHHOHFWURQLFSDUDPHWHUVRI(0027)7VZLWK\nGLIIHUHQWW\\SHVRIDFWLYHOD\\HUV\nthe ones with channels incorporated with Ga exhibited decreasing ߤ with increasing Ga content. For the TFT with channel Type D \nand the highest Ga fraction of 41%, a lowest ߤ of 1.3 cm2/Vs was obtained. This suggests that an excessively high concentration of Ga in the quaternary system may have resulted in a reduction of the carrier concentration in the channel, perhaps due to the formation of traps. These traps could also be responsible for the capping of the ܫୢ at high ܸ, due to a high parasitic S/D resistance. \nTFTs with channels incorporated with Ga also exhibited improved scalability. This is best evidenced by the right shift of the Von of the TFTs with L = 2 µ m (Fig. 4a). Furthermore, it also took a shorter O 2 annealing time (Fig. 4b) to obtain functional shortchannel devices. The more positive Von of the ITZGO TFTs with shorter L is consistent with a lower defect concentration in the channel region ,.\nDevice reliability was characterized by subjecting the TFTs to positive gate-bias thermal stress (PBTS) and negative gate-bias stress with illumination (NBIS). The results are shown in Figure 5.\nPBTS was carried out at 85 °C with Vg set at Von + 20 V; NBIS\nwas tested with illumination of 0.5 W/m 2 at wavelength of ~480 nm with Vg set at Von − 20 V. The stress duration for both PBTS and NBIS was 3000s. When the TFTs were subjected to PBTS, the transfer curves shifted in the negative Vg direction. ΔV on of ~ − 3.6 V for ITZO TFT and ~ −0.8 V for ITZGO TFT with channel Type C. The improvement in reliability with Ga incorporation is more obvious against the illumination stress. Significantly reduced degradation was observed, with Δ V on of −0.9 V for ITZGO TFT\nwith channel Type B and 0.9 V for ITZGO TFT with channel Type C, this compared to a much more negative − 6.6V for ITZO TFT.\nThe enhanced reliability could be attributed to the larger bandgap resulting from Ga 2 O 3 incorporation in the active channel. Shown in Figure 6 is the absorption spectra of MO thin films with different Ga content. The Eg values can be extracted by extension along the dashed lines. E g increases with increasing Ga content. The values are 2.30 eV for ITZO, 2.45 eV for 23%Ga in ITZGO, 2.77 eV for 41%Ga in ITZGO and 4.32 eV for amorphous Ga 2 O 3 . As the photosensitivity of MO is attributed to the excitation of electrons from the sub-gap-states to the conduction-band minimum (CBM),\nenlarging the optical bandgap will increase the threshold of the photoexcitation energy between the sub-gap states and the CBM.\nFurthermore, the increasing Ga in the film could suppress the formation of defects, such as oxygen vacancies, weakly bonded oxygen, and hydrogen impurities ,. This leads to an overall improvement in device reliability.\n4. Conclusion\nThe effects of bandgap engineering on the performance of EMMO\nTFTs based on ITZO and ITZGO have been studied and compared.\nIncorporating Ga in high-mobility ITZO film is shown to be an effective method for widening the bandgap of the host ITZO\nsemiconductor and suppressing the population of defects in the channel region, hence leading to improved scalability and reliability of the resulting EMMO TFT.\ndLl snitnO voliW , giersvietJ nanit vd 7.5141.mbs/2001 103 μαι αιτιστ, οτμ 395 (1707,905)\n408 an sophic VO tasn to solvi and creating D CL ' L ' I N I N ' E S 1 O R A\nThis work was supported in part by Grant No. GHP/007/18GD \nand PiH/266/19 from the Innovation and Technology Fund and jointly with Grant No. 201807010098 from the Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou.

        "text": "Fluorinated Ingazno Thin-Film Transistor With Hflao Gate Dielectric\nLing Xuan Qian and Peter T. Lai, Senior *Member, IEEE*\nAbstract**— Fluorinated amorphous InGaZnO thin-film transistor with HfLaO gate dielectric has been studied by treating**\nInGaZnO film in a CHF3/O2 plasma. The saturation carrier mobility can be improved from 29.6 cm2/V·**s to as high as**\n39.8 cm2/V·s. In addition, the passivation effect of the fluorination on the dominant donor-like traps at the InGaZnO/HfLaO\ninterface is observed, as reflected by suppression of hysteresis phenomenon and smaller subthreshold swing. Measurement result of low-frequency noise further supports the improvement in electrical properties by the plasma treatment.\nIndex Terms— Amorphous InGaZnO (a-IGZO), thin-film transistor (TFT), HfLaO, fluorine, plasma.\nN THE field of flat-panel displays (FPDs), thin-film transistors (TFTs) with high field-effect mobility (μFE) are required . Accordingly, ZnO-based TFTs have been intensively investigated to replace conventional amorphous silicon TFTs. Compared to polycrystalline ZnO (poly-ZnO) TFTs, amorphous InGaZnO (a-IGZO) TFTs exhibit better spatial uniformity of device performance. In addition, the incorporation of Ga ions, which act as carrier suppressors and network stabilizers in InZnO (IZO), is beneficial to achieving high carrier mobility and excellent uniformity . Hence, a-IGZO TFT\nhas been regarded as one of the most promising candidates for the application in FPDs. Lee *et al.* reported a-IGZO TFT\nwith a high μFE of 28 cm2/V·s using ZrO2 gate dielectric .\nHowever, it had large subthreshold swing (SS, 0.56 V/dec) and large threshold-voltage (VTH) hysteresis (-VH, 3 V), which could slow down the switching and deteriorate the reliability properties of the device respectively. In addition, Zan *et al.*\nused nanometer dot doping to improve μFE to an average value of 67.5 cm2/V·s . Nevertheless, if considering the effective intrinsic channel length, the average intrinsic μFE is 33.8 cm2/V·s. However, the SS of this device is as large as 0.92 V/dec, and a negative VTH of −2.94 V was achieved, making the device unsuitable for switching applications.\na-IGZO TFT with Ta2O5 gate dielectric achieved a high μFE of 61.5 cm2/V·s, but also had a large SS (0.61 V/dec) . It was reported that the electrical characteristics of poly-ZnO TFTs could be improved by fluorine implantation . Unfortunately, the improvements in mobility and SS were accompanied by a change of operation mode from accumulation to depletion.\nDigital Object Identifier 10.1109/LED.2013.2296895 Fig. 1. Schematic diagrams of the device cross section: (a) during the\nCHF3/O2 plasma treatment; (b) a-IGZO TFT with HfLaO gate dielectric.\nFurthermore, fluorine doping by spin coating of metalfluoride (ZnF2 and InF3) precursor aqueous solution was also adopted to improve both the carrier mobility and stability of IZO TFTs .\nIn this letter, the effects of fluorine incorporation in a-IGZO\non the characteristics of a-IGZO TFTs are studied for the first time. Fluorine is introduced in a-IGZO by means of plasma treatment, which is more compatible with device processing on large-area substrate and also induces less damage to thin film than implantation. Due to its superior properties, including high dielectric constant, good thermal stability and low trap density , high-k material HfLaO is selected as the gate dielectric for the samples in this letter. Consequently, both high saturation carrier mobility (μsat, 39.8 cm2/V·s) and small SS\n(0.21 V/dec) can simultaneously be obtained by the sample with the plasma treatment. Moreover, this sample can operate in enhancement mode with a small -VH of −0.5 V.\nIi. Experimental Details\nThe schematic diagrams of the device cross section during the CHF3/O2 plasma treatment and after all the fabrication processes are shown in Fig. 1. P-type (100) silicon acts as both substrate and gate electrode. Firstly, deposition of a 40-nm HfLaO film was done by a sputtering system.\nAn annealing treatment at 400 °C in N2 for 10 min followed.\nSubsequently, the sample received a deposition of a 60-nm a-IGZO active layer through radio-frequency (RF) sputtering in an Ar/O2 mixed ambient. Then, the sample received the CHF3/O2 plasma treatment with the flow rate of 10 sccm/\n1 sccm at a RF power of 20 W for 3 min. The addition of O2 was to remove carbon and increase fluorine concentration by suppressing CFx radicals , . The control sample without plasma treatment was also fabricated. After that, a lift-off process was utilized to form the source/drain electrodes, which were composed of 20-nm Ti and 80-nm Au. The channel width (W) and length (L) were 100 μm and 20 μm respectively. Finally, both samples were annealed in a forming-gas\n(N2 : H2 = 95 : 5) ambient at 350 °C for 20 min. In addition, metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) capacitor was prepared beside the transistor to monitor the gate-oxide capacitance per unit area (Cox, equal to 0.202 μ F/cm2 in this letter). For each condition, 12 devices were measured, and the device with the median value of μsat was selected to represent the condition.\n0741-3106 © 2014 IEEE.

The ordinate refers to the atom counts in an analysis area of 56.6 µ m × 56.6 µ m while the abscissa is about the acquisition time which reflects the depth from the surface of a-IGZO. For the plasma-treated sample before the forming-gas annealing, it is apparent that fluorine has been successfully introduced into a-IGZO by the plasma treatment, and majority of fluorine atoms piles up near the surface of a-IGZO. The fluorine peak at the IGZO/HfLaO interface should be due to its blocking effect on the fluorine incorporation. After the forming-gas annealing, fluorine atoms have diffused towards the a-IGZO/HfLaO interface, and a fraction of them has spread into HfLaO.\nTFTs with or without CHF 3 /O 2 plasma treatment for a-IGZO:\nto-source voltage (V DS ) of 5 V. The important electrical parameters are extracted from Fig. 3 and listed in Table I.\nAmong them, µ sat and V th are calculated from a linear fitting to the plot of I /2 vs. V GS (using a V GS range of 1 V), which is based on the I–V equation of field-effect transistor operating in the saturation region:\nId = ( Μ Satcoxw/2L) (V Gs − V Th) 2\nThe inset of Fig. 3(a) reveals µ sat is gate-bias dependent, which is consistent with the result reported in , and accordingly the maximum value of µ sat during the V GS sweeping is selected for comparison purpose , . Compared to the control sample ( μ sat = 29.6 cm 2 /V · s), the plasmatreated sample possesses a steeper slope of I 1/2 vs. V GS and accordingly a higher µ sat (39.8 cm 2 /V s). It is well known that fluorine and oxygen have similar ionic radius, and the Zn–F bonding is more stable than the Zn–O one. Therefore, it is easy to cause the substitution of the oxygen atoms in the lattice (O ) of a-IGZO by the fluorine atoms derived from the CHF 3 /O 2 plasma. Moreover, the difference in electrovalency between oxygen ion (O 2 − ) and fl uorine ion (F − ) can induce the substitution of an oxygen ion by a fluorine ion to generate a free electron :\n0 X + F − → F 0 + e −\nTherefore, the electron concentration in a-IGZO is increased, resulting in a shift of the zero-gate-bias Femi level towards\n| Plasma         | Gate       | A V H          |         |         |       |\n|----------------|------------|----------------|---------|---------|-------|\n| treatment      | dielectric | (cm 2 / V - s) | (V)     | (V/dec) | ( V ) |\n| w [this work]  | HfLaO      | 39.8           | 2.8     | 0.21    | –0.5  |\n| wo [this work] | HLaO       | 29.6           | 2.5     | 0.31    | -1.3  |\n| PVP            | 3.33.8     | 2.94           | 0.92    |         |       |\n| w/o         | N/A        |                |         |         |       |\n| w/o [ 3 ]      | ZrO2       | 28             | 3.2     | 0.56    | 1.13  |\n| w/o        | AbO3       | 21.6           | 11, 122 | 0.2     | N/A   |\n| world          | NON(HIO,)  | 10.2           | -0,92   | 0.13    | 0.9   |\nthe conduction band. Accordingly, a larger fraction of the acceptor-like traps in a-IGZO and/or at the a-IGZO/HfLaO\ninterface can be filled by the generated free electrons. As a result of the filling of acceptor-like traps at/near the a-IGZO/HfLaO interface, trap-induced scattering on channel electrons is suppressed, and thus carrier mobility is increased . However, even with an increased electron concentration in a-IGZO, V TH is slightly increased from 2.5 V to 2.8 V by the plasma treatment, possibly due to the introduction of negative fl uorine ions in the gate oxide.\nMoreover, I D increases linearly with V DS in the region of low V DS , and current saturation can be observed in the region of high VDS. Due to the increase in psat, the on current (Ion) at V GS = 10 V and V DS = 5 V for the plasma-treated sample\n(Ion = 1149 µA) is improved by over 20% compared to the control sample ( I on = 934 µ A). However, the off current ( I off )\nis also increased, which should be ascribed to the conductivity increase of the ZnO-based material after fluorine incorporation demonstrated by Equation (2) , . As a whole, a slight improvement of I on /Ioff (from 9.0 × 10 5 to 9.2 × 10 5 ) can still be achieved by the plasma treatment.\nAs shown in Fig. 4, both samples present a hysteresis phenomenon in the counter-clockwise direction, which reveals the dominant role of donor-like traps at the a-IGZO/HfLaO\ninterface. Nevertheless, the reduction of Δ V H from − 1.3 V to\n−0.5 V reveals that the counter-clockwise hysteresis can be obviously suppressed by the CHF3/O2 plasma treatment for a-IGZO. Therefore, it is believed that the CHF3/O2 plasma treatment can effectively passivate the dominant donor-like traps at the a-IGZO/HfLaO interface. A similar effect on donor-like traps after fluorine incorporation in ZnO-based material was reported . In addition, the subthreshold region shown in Fig. 3(a) is steeper for the plasma-treated sample, and thus a smaller SS (0.21 V/dec) is obtained as compared to the control sample (SS = 0.31 V/dec). It was reported that the donor-like traps existing at the intermediate energy levels in the bandgap of ZnO could influence the subthreshold swing with a hump in the transfer curve of ZnO TFTs . Moreover, Raja *et al.* claimed that the unpredictable subthreshold swing with a hump-shaped transfer curve in a-IGZO TFTs could be suppressed through passivating the natural intrinsic donor states . Hence, the decrease of SS further verifies the passivation effect on the donor-like traps at the a-IGZO/HfLaO\ninterface by the CHF3/O2 plasma treatment.\nAs shown in Fig. 5, the normalized noise power spectral density (SiD/I2D) is measured at a fixed (VGS - VTH) of 5.0 V\nin the linear region (VDS = 1.0 V) for each sample. The lowfrequency noise (LFN) of a-IGZO TFTs can be influenced by carrier number fluctuation (due to interface traps) and/or mobility fluctuation (due to Coulomb scattering) . Since the LFN of the plasma-treated sample is smaller than that of the control sample, the improvement in electrical properties\n(smaller SS, smaller -VH and higher μsat) by the CHF3/O2 plasma treatment is further supported.\nIn this letter, the effect of fluorine incorporation in a-IGZO\nby the CHF3/O2 plasma treatment on the characteristics of a-IGZO TFT with HfLaO gate dielectric has been investigated.\nIt is found that μsat can be increased from 29.6 cm2/V·s to as high as 39.8 cm2/V·s by the plasma treatment. Accordingly, Ion is increased by over 20%. In addition, the passivation effect of plasma treatment on the dominant donor-like traps at the a-IGZO/HfLaO interface is also observed. As a result, the hysteresis phenomenon is suppressed while SS is reduced.\nAccordingly, both high saturation carrier mobility and small SS (0.21 V/dec) can simultaneously be achieved by the plasma-treated sample, which can also operate in enhancement mode with a small -VH of −0.5 V. The LFN measurement result further supports the improvement in electrical properties.\nIn summary, fluorinated a-IGZO is a promising material for making high-performance TFT used in the field of FPDs."

Despite this, metal oxide transistors require signifi cant improvements in performance and electrical reliability before they can be applied widely in optoelectronics. Amorphous indium–zinc–tin oxide (a-IZTO) has been considered an alternative channel layer to a prototypical indium–gallium–zinc oxide (IGZO) with the aim of achieving a high mobility (>40 cm 2 Vs −1 ) transistors. The effects of the gate bias and light stress on the resulting a-IZTO fi eldeffect transistors are examined in detail. Hydrogen impurities in the a-IZTO \nsemiconductor are found to play a direct role in determining the photo-bias stability of the resulting transistors. The Al 2 O 3 -inserted IZTO thin-fi lm transistors (TFTs) are hydrogen-poor, and consequently show better resistance to the external-bias-thermal stress and photo-bias-thermal stress than the hydrogenrich control IZTO TFTs. First-principles calculations show that even in the amorphous phase, hydrogen impurities including interstitial H and substitutional H \ncan be bistable centers with an electronic deep-to-shallow transition through large lattice relaxation. The negative threshold voltage shift of the a-IZTO transistors under a negative-bias-thermal stress and negative-bias-illumination stress condition is attributed to the transition from the acceptor-like deep interstitial H i\n(or substitutional H-DX − **) to the shallow H i**\n+ ) with a high (low) activation energy barrier. Conclusively, the delicate controllability of hydrogen is a key factor to achieve the high performance and stability of the metal oxide transistors. \nand fl exible electronic devices. [ 1,2 ] For this purpose, semiconducting oxides have been studied intensively for use in transparent and fl exible electronics, such as pixel drivers for fl at panel displays (FPDs), electronic paper, skin sensor, and smart identifi cation cards. [ 3–7 ] These emerging applications are enabled by the intriguing properties of semiconducting oxide thin-fi lm transistors (TFTs), such as high mobility (>10 cm 2 Vs −1 ), steep subthreshold slope (<300 mV decade −1 ), good transparency (>80% to visible light), and low temperature processing. [ 8,9 ] Historically, indium-based oxide materials have been used mainly as passive transparent conducting oxide (TCO) fi lms for fl atscreen displays, energy-effi cient windows, light-emitting diodes, and photovoltaic cell. The controllability of the chemical compositions in the multicomponent metal oxide system enables tailoring of the electrical, optical, chemical, and physical properties. In particular, the discovery of carrier suppressors, such as Ga, Hf, Zr, etc., in multicomponent metal oxide materials allows an extension of the electronic applications from the traditional passive electrode components to the semiconducting active components for the fi eld-effect transistors. [ 1,10,11 ] Despite these promising properties, the instability of semiconducting oxide-based TFTs under the electrical and light stress is critical hurdles against commercialization of the devices. [ 12 ]\n1. Introduction\n The lack of transparency and high temperature processing in silicon-based electronics prevent their applications in transparent \n| Y. Kang, S.

[ 13–21 ] Nevertheless, the deeper insight into complex defect physics in semiconducting oxides is essential for gaining a complete understanding of the bias- and photoinstability of metal oxide-based TFTs, which is a prerequisite for developing stable materials with better performance. \n In a microscopic viewpoint, the shallow donors in semiconducting oxide materials created by the photo-bias stress do not recover instantaneously to their original state, leading to a displacement retained for a prolong time of the threshold voltage in the semiconducting oxide TFTs. The microscopic mechanisms proposed to date are based on bistable centers allowing for an electronic deep-to-shallow transition, such as DX in Al x Ga 1- x As, [ 22 ] V O in crystal ZnO (c-ZnO)/a-InGaZnO 4 , \nperoxide (O 2 2− ), [ 26 ] and O i\n[ 20,21 ] in a-InGaZnO 4 . In particular, the photostress creates electron–hole pairs fi rst. If the holes are captured by deep centers, such as V O\n0 , O 2−+ O 2− (disorder defect), and O i 2− (bonded to cations), the deep centers can transform to shallow ones, such as V O\n2+ , O 2 2− , and O i 0 (attached to an anion). The recombination of these ionized defects and electrons occurs with certain activation energies, extending the lifetime of electrons in the conduction band, which leads to a negative shift in the threshold voltage ( VTH ). Therefore, it is essential to identify the types of bistable centers in the semiconducting oxides. \n Hydrogen is introduced easily in oxides as a ubiquitous impurity, and critically affects the electrical and optical properties of the host material. Many theoretical and experimental studies suggest that hydrogen impurity is responsible for the n-type conductivity of oxides. [ 27–30 ] This is because hydrogen becomes a shallow donor in two forms; interstitial H (H i ) and substitutional H at the O site (H O ) (as in c-ZnO). [ 27–29 ] Some studies reported that hydrogen annealing suppresses the instability of amorphous indium–zinc–tin oxide (a-IGZO) [ 31 ] because H passivates the instability sources, such as V O in the form of H O . \n[ 32 ] On the other hand, the present study found that the TFT instability is strongly proportional to the H-contamination profi le in a-IZTO. Therefore, the H-induced instabilities of amorphous oxides are still unresolved. H-related instabilities may have two origins: (i) hydrogen impurities increase the concentrations of the presently-identifi ed bistable centers or (ii) \nhydrogen impurities become bistable centers themselves. For an indirect scenario, it can be simply understood because the relative formation enthalpies of deep V O\n0 (O i 2− ) in O-defi cient \n(O-rich) conditions are lower with respect to shallow V O\nat the rising Fermi level ( EF ), which is driven by the shallow H. On the other hand, considering the variety of the coupling between H and other defects, it is unclear if the validity of deep V O\n0 and O i 2− in terms of a point defect is sustained (for example, the H-passivated V O model in ref. [ 32 ] . Therefore, other aspects on hydrogen should be considered. Indeed, there is considerable evidence suggesting that hydrogen would be a bistable center. Recently, it was suggested that theoretically there can be acceptor-like hydrogen states with deep levels, i.e., metastable H i\n− (bonded to Zn atoms) [ 33 ] for H i and stable H-DX − (regarded as a complex defect of V O\n0+H i\n− ) [ 34 ] for H O in c-ZnO. Furthermore, the concentration of n-type free carriers was measured experimentally to be much lower than the H-concentration in \nwww.advelectronicmat.de **www.MaterialsViews.com**\namorphous oxides, such as a-InGaZnO 4 . \n[ 35 ] Despite this uncertainty for hydrogen, to the best of the authors' knowledge, there are no reports of the bistability of hydrogen in the amorphous phase; hence, the bistability issue remains to be examined. \n On the other hand, indium–gallium–zinc oxide (IGZO) is the most popular channel material for semiconducting oxide TFTs, where the indium and gallium cations act the mobility enhancer and carrier suppressor, respectively. [ 1,4,9 ] Although increasing the indium fraction in IGZO allows an enhanced charge carrier mobility from the low electron effective mass and effi cient intercalation of the In 5 s orbital in In 2 O 3 , the electrical and optical stabilities of the resulting device deteriorate due to the easier creation of V O in an indium-rich composition. [ 36,37 ] The mobility of IGZO TFTs with an acceptable stability is limited to ≈10 cm 2 Vs −1 . To meet the requirements of the high resolution (>200 pixels per inch), large area (>60 in.), high frame rate (>240 Hz), and 3D visual effects for the next generation FPDs, fl exible and/or transparent display, the fi eldeffect mobility need to be improved to more than 30 cm 2 Vs −1 . \n In this study, the a-IZTO fi lm was chosen as the channel layer for the semiconducting oxide TFTs because a substantially higher fi eld-effect mobility can be obtained because of the synergic intercalation of the 5 s orbital of indium and tin atoms. [ 38 ] To examine the effects of hydrogen contamination on the light- and bias-induced instabilities of a-IZTO, two types of a-IZTO TFTs with a different hydrogen content in the channel layer were fabricated. The a-IZTO TFTs with a hydrogen-rich channel (hereafter referred as a control device) exhibited a promising high saturation mobility (µ SAT ) of 48.0 cm 2 Vs −1 , low subthreshold gate swing of 0.14 V decade −1 , threshold voltage of 0.4 V and ION/OFF ratio of 10 9 . In contrast, the µ SAT value was reduced to 20.5 cm 2 Vs −1 for hydrogen-poor a-IZTO TFTs, whereas the other device parameters were comparable to those of the control device. On the other hand, the positive (PBTS), negative-biasthermal stress (NBTS) and negative-bias-illumination stress \n(NBIS) stabilities for the hydrogen-poor a-IZTO TFTs were much better than those of the control device. We also examined the hydrogen-related electronic states in a-IZTO semiconductors thoroughly using fi rst-principles calculations. The electronic structure calculation indicated that the bistable hydrogen impurities are generally responsible for the VTH instabilities under various bias and photo-bias stress conditions in metal oxide semiconductors. To date, ubiquitous hydrogen impurity has been considered an assistant that can alter the electronic properties and concentration of deep trap centers, such as oxygen vacancies, oxygen interstitials, and peroxide in the host material. These results can provide a comprehensive single framework to understand the PBTS, NBTS, and NBIS instability of any semiconducting oxide TFT based on the simultaneous consideration of well-known deep trap centers and hydrogen impurities. \n2. Results And Discussion 2.1. Performance And Photo-Bias-Thermal-Stress Instabilities Of A-Izto Tfts\n Two a-IZTO TFT devices were fabricated, in which the hydrogen concentration was tuned differently to examine the \n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png) \neffect of hydrogen impurities on the mobility and instability of the a-IZTO fi eld-effect transistors. **Figure** 1 a,d shows a schematic cross-section of the a-IZTO TFTs without (control device) \nand with an Al 2 O 3 interlayer (referred to as Al 2 O 3 -inserted device), respectively. The PECVD-derived SiO 2 passivation layer contained a huge hydrogen concentration, which was controlled by feeding a high fl ow rate of SiH 4 gas to the reactor during the deposition process. In the case of the control device, the hydrogen in the passivation SiO 2 layer would diffuse into the a-IZTO channel layer through the underlying etch stop layer (ESL) SiO 2 fi lm during post deposition annealing (PDA) \nat 350 °C (Figure 1 a). In contrast, the Al 2 O 3 -inserted device would have a lower hydrogen concentration in the a-IZTO \nchannel layer because rf-sputtered Al 2 O 3 fi lms have excellent diffusion barrier properties against hydrogen permeation \n(Figure 1 d). Figure 1 b,e shows the representative transfer characteristics of the control and Al 2 O 3 -inserted a-IZTO TFTs. The fi eld-effect mobility (µ SAT ) was determined from the maximum incremental slope of an IDS1/2 versus VGS plot in the saturation region according to the following equation: IDS = ( WCi /2 L )\nµ SAT ( VGS - VTH ) 2 , where L is the channel length, W is the width, and Ci is the gate capacitance per unit area. The VTH was determined from the gate voltage ( VGS ) needed to produce a drain current of L / W × 10 nA at VDS = 5.1 V. The subthreshold gate swing (SS = d VGS /dlog IDS ) was extracted from the linear portion of a plot of the log IDS versus VGS . The a-IZTO TFTs without an Al 2 O 3 interlayer (control device) exhibited a high µ SAT of 48.0 cm 2 Vs −1 , low SS of 0.15 V decade −1 , VTH of 0.4 V, \nand ION/OFF ratio of 10 10 . The high mobility for the a-IZTO TFTs was achieved without compromising the ION/OFF ratio because the ION/OFF ratio (≥10 8 ) and fi eld-effect mobility are equally important in designing a practical active-matrix pixel backplane. Although a high mobility exceeding 60 cm 2 Vs −1 for the oxide TFTs has been reported frequently, they suffer from a low ION/OFF ratio presumably due to the high conductivity of the channel layer, ill-defi ned channel dimensions or inadequately high gate leakage current. [ 39–41 ] On the other hand, the µ SAT and VTH values for the a-IZTO TFTs with an Al 2 O 3 interlayer were reduced to 20.5 cm 2 Vs −1 and positively displaced to 1.4 V, respectively (Figure 1 e), whereas the ION/OFF ratio was comparable to the control device, as summarized in **Table** 1 .

The output current of the Al 2 O 3 -inserted device was diminished due to its lower mobility compared to the control device. \n To explain the different mobility of both devices, SIMS depth profi ling of hydrogen species was performed for both samples. \nFigure 2 showed the SIMS depth profi les of OH − and hydrogen concentration in a-IZTO thin fi lms with a passivation stack of SiO 2 (200 nm)/SiO 2 (300 nm) and SiO 2 (200 nm)/Al 2 O 3 (50 nm)/\nSiO 2 (300 nm). A lower hydrogen concentration including OH −\nand atomic hydrogen was observed for the Al 2 O 3 -inserted stack. The 300-nm-thick SiO 2 passivation fi lm was prepared under hydrogen-rich conditions (see the Experimental Section). Therefore, during thermal annealing at 350 °C for 60 min, the diffusion of hydrogen species into the a-IZTO channel layer was suppressed due to the existence of Al 2 O 3 fi lms for the Al 2 O 3 -\ninserted samples. As mentioned previously, some of the incorporated hydrogen species act as shallow donors. Therefore, the tailing states below the conduction band minimum of a-IZTO \nsemiconductor for the Al 2 O 3 -inserted fi eld-effect transistors will be less fi lled because of the lower hydrogen-donated free electrons. Therefore, the higher µ SAT and lower VTH for the control device compared to those of Al 2 O 3 -inserted devices can be attributed to their larger free electron density as a result of the higher level of hydrogen incorporation because charge carrier transport in the zinc-based oxide semiconductor is governed by a percolation conduction mechanism. The variations in SS values for both devices also need to be considered carefully because of the double-sided character of the hydrogen impurities. The SS \nvalues (≈0.10 V decade −1 ) for the Al 2 O 3 -inserted a-IZTO TFTs were lower than those (≈0.15 V decade −1 ) of the control a-IZTO \nTFTs. The fast bulk trap density ( NSS ) in the forbidden gap of a-IZTO semiconductor and semiconductor-insulator trap density ( Dit ) can be estimated from the following equation [ 42 ]\nSs = + Qk T N T D C E B Ss Ch It I ( )/[ Log( )], (1)\n where q is the electron charge, kB is Boltzmann's constant, T\nis the absolute temperature, and tch is the channel layer thickness. The maximum NSS,max ( Dit,max ) value in the a-IZTO TFTs was estimated by setting the Dit ( NSS ) value to zero. The NSS,max ( Dit,max ) values for the control and Al 2 O 3 -inserted a-IZTO \nTFTs were 4.6 × 10 16 eV −1 cm −3 (2.3 × 10 11 eV −1 cm −2 ) and 3.1 × 10 16 eV −1 cm −3 (1.6 × 10 11 eV −1 cm −2 ), respectively. For the benchmarking comparison, these NSS,max values for the a-IZTO \nTFTs were lower than those ((1−6) × 10 17 eV −1 cm −3 ) of the IGZO [ 43 ] and IZTO [ 44 ] TFTs. It should be noted that the lower NSS ( Dit ) values for the a-IZTO TFTs in this study can also come from the different compositions or/and components in the channel layer. The high mobility of the a-IZTO TFTs would be a refl ection of the lower NSS distribution in the forbidden band gap of the a-IZTO semiconductor and lower Dit value between a-IZTO and SiO 2 fi lm. In addition, the higher NSS value for the control devices compared to the Al 2 O 3 -inserted devices suggests that the incorporation of hydrogen species can accompany the creation of the defect state as well as the electron doping into a-IZTO channel. For further insight, the density-of-state (DOS) distributions for both devices were extracted using the Meyer– Neldel rule (NMR). Temperature-dependent fi eld effect data were used to calculate the near conduction band. The drain current ( IDS ) was thermally activated, which can be described by the following equation [ 45 ]\n$$\\left(-{\\frac{E_{\\mathrm{a}}}{k T}}\\right)$$\n where IDS0 is the prefactor, Ea is the activation energy, K is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. The Ea of IZTO TFT with different etch-stopper layers is VGS -dependent, and their relationship obeys the MN rule. The MN rule is an intrinsic property of a disordered semiconductor, which has been reported in various organic and inorganic semiconductor materials, including pentacene, [ 46 ] a-Si, [ 47 ] and a-IGZO. [ 45 ] The MN rule is expressed as follows [ 48 ]\nI I Ae Ds0 Ds00 = ⋅ Exp( ) A (3)\n where A is the MN parameter. Using the MN relation, extraction of the DOS distribution for the a-IZTO TFTs was performed assuming that most induced electron charges are occupied in the localized energy states, and the probability of fi nding an electron at a certain energy level is determined by the 0 K Fermi statistics, as reported by Chen et al. [ 45 ] The total DOS distribution for the sample A and B devices with different etch stopper layers was calculated, as shown in **Figure** 3 . The overall DOS \ndistribution for the a-IZTO TFTs with the Al 2 O 3 interlayer was smaller than that of the control a-IZTO TFTs over the 0.2–0.3 eV energy range extracted. This agrees with the comparative results for the NSS values calculated from the SS value. \n The effects of hydrogen incorporation on the dark PBTS and NBTS instability of the resulting a-IZTO TFTs was investigated. \nThe devices were stressed under the following conditions: VGS at VTH + 20 V and VTH − 20 V for the PBTS and NBTS, respectively, at room temperature. The VDS was fi xed to 5.1 V and the BTS \nduration was 3600 s. **Figure** 4 a,b presents the evolution of the transfer curve as a function of the applied PBTS time for the control and Al 2 O 3 -inserted device, respectively. For the control device, the parallel VTH shift of 0.41 V to the positive direction after the application of PBTS was observed without an accompanying change in mobility, SS and ION/OFF ratio. The positive VTH shift for the Al 2 O 3 -inserted device was reduced drastically to 0.13 V. The superior electrical stability for the Al 2 O 3 -inserted device was preserved for the NBTS duration: the negative VTH shift for the control and Al 2 O 3 -inserted device were −6.0 and −1.5 V, \nrespectively, as shown in Figure. 4 c,d. The NBIS stability, which is one of the critical fi gure-of-merits for optoelectronics applications of the a-IZTO semiconductor, was also examined for both devices. The bias thermal stress condition for NBIS instability \nwww.MaterialsViews.com **www.advelectronicmat.de**\nwas identical to the NBTS except for light irradiation. To amplify the VTH variation of the a-IZTO TFTs during the NBIS applications, the blue LED was used as a light source where the light intensity was 75 µW cm −2 . The VTH shift was accelerated by the simultaneous light irradiation on the channel region. **Figure** 5 a,b shows the evolution of the transfer characteristics of the control and Al 2 O 3 -inserted devices, respectively, as a function of the NBIS time. The control device suffered from a huge negative VTH shift (−8.4 V) during the NBIS duration, whereas the VTH\ninstability for the Al 2 O 3 -inserted devices was strongly suppressed \n(ΔVTH = −3.0 V). It is noted that under only the NBIS condition, the hump near the subthreshold drain current region of the transfer characteristics was observed for both devices (Figure 5 ) whereas the application of dark PBTS and NBTS into the a-IZTO \nTFTs caused the parallel displacement of the transfer characteristics without any distortion (Figure 4 ). The hump occurrence in terms of transfer characteristics depended on the gate bias sweep direction: in the case of reverse gate sweep ( VGS : from 15 to \n−15 V) the hump could not be observed (data not shown). This gate sweep-direction dependent hump occurrence under photon illumination was attributed to either the trapping of the photoinduced hole carriers, [ 49,50 ] or the pile-up of ionic defects such as V O\n+[ 52 ] at the dielectric/channel interface. \n![4_image_2.png](4_image_2.png) \nwww.advelectronicmat.de **www.MaterialsViews.com**\n![5_image_1.png](5_image_1.png) \n The activation energy for the NBTS and recovery behavior was examined. **Figure** 6 shows the recovery behavior of the C - V characteristics for the control and Al 2 O 3 -inserted devices. The C - V\ncurves during the NBTS duration were shifted negatively, which is consistent with the negative VTH shift, as shown in Figure 4 c,d. \nAfter turning off the NBTS, the C - V curves partially recovered to the original VTH direction. The transition of the charge state in the hydrogen impurities would be strongly related to the activation energy of the NBTS and recovery process. Therefore, the kinetics of the NBTS and recovery process was also investigated. \nFigure 7 presents the temperature-dependent VTH variations of both devices as a function of the NBTS time. The data were fi tted using a stretched exponential formula [ 53,54 ]\n$$\\left.\\left(1\\right)\\right|=V_{0}\\left\\{1-\\exp\\left[-\\left({\\frac{t}{\\tau}}\\right)^{\\beta}\\right]\\right\\},$$\n where τ is the relaxation time, β is the dispersion parameter of the barrier energy height, and V0 is VGS - Vth0 ( VGS is the \napplied gate bias stress). The relaxation time ( τ ) was activated thermally according to the following equation [ 53,54 ]\n$$\\exp\\!\\left({\\frac{E_{\\tau}}{k_{\\mathrm{{B}}}T}}\\right)\\!,$$\n where E τ is the activation energy for the process, ν is the frequency prefactor for emission over the barrier, T is the absolute temperature, and kB is the Boltzmann constant. \nFigure 7 b,e presents the variations of ln τ as a function of the reciprocal temperature for the control and Al 2 O 3 -inserted devices, respectively. The data were well fi tted using Equation ( 5) , suggesting that the devices have a temperature dependence on τ and the NBTS-induced Vth shift is a thermally activated process. The E τ values for the control and Al 2 O 3 -inserted devices were calculated from the slope of the straight lines. The E τ,NBTS values of the control and Al 2 O 3 -inserted devices were 0.31 and 0.90 eV under NBTS condition, respectively. Therefore, the inferior NBTS stability of the control IZTO TFTs can be attributed to the lower activation energy of 0.31 eV. This suggests that the a-IZTO materials with a large hydrogen concentration would have a variety of paths to the deep-to-shallow transition in hydrogen impurities. This speculation can be further supported by the smaller β values of the control device, as shown in Figure 7 c,f, because the β is a measure of the spread in the E τ distribution. [ 55 ] **Figure** 8 a,d shows the temperaturedependent recovery behavior of the VTH value for the control and Al 2 O 3 -inserted devices, respectively. To accelerate the recovery process, a positive gate bias stress of VTH + 20 V was applied during the measurements of the transfer curves. From linear fi tting between 1/ T versus ln τ using Equation ( 5) , the E τ,recovery values extracted for the control and Al 2 O 3 -inserted devices were 0.10 and 0.51 eV under PBTS condition, respectively. In addition, the faster recovery for the control device compared to the Al 2 O 3 -inserted device, as shown in Figure 6 , can also be explained by the smaller E τ,recovery value of 0.10 eV. The extracted β values for both devices were comparable to those for the NBTS induced transition process. \n The difference between the control and Al 2 O 3 -inserted devices on the light- and biasinduced instabilities of a-IZTO semiconductors cannot be explained by the well-known mechanisms involving oxygen vacancies. First, the superior PBTS stability for the Al 2 O 3 -inserted device can be explained by charge trapping modeling. The amount of the positive VTH shift under the PBTS condition would be proportional to the charge trapping frequency of the accumulated carriers at the defect sites including the gate dielectric and IZTO channel layer. Therefore, the stronger resistance of the Al 2 O 3 -inserted device under the PBTS condition appears to \n![6_image_0.png](6_image_0.png) \nbe due to the lower concentration of tailing states, as shown in Figure 3 . This result is well corroborated by the fact that the NSS,max and Dit,max values extracted from the SS factor for the Al 2 O 3 -inserted device was lower than those for the control device (see Table 1 ). On the other hand, the origin of the lower tailing states in the Al 2 O 3 -inserted device is unclear. Moreover, \n![6_image_1.png](6_image_1.png) \nthe reason why the Al 2 O 3 -inserted device showed better NBTS and NBIS stability is more ambiguous. The NBTS- and NBISinduced instabilities of the semiconducting oxide TFTs have been understood based mainly on the oxygen vacancy model, which basically suggests an anion (oxygen)-defi - ciency in the semiconductor layer. The deep oxygen vacancy defect (V O\n0 ) can be excited into the shallow ionized oxygen vacancy defect (V O\n2+ ) by the application of NBTS or NBIS, leading to free electron carriers in the conduction band and a negative VTH shift of the resulting oxide TFTs. On the other hand, this V O model cannot explicitly explain the strongly hydrogen content-dependent NBTS and NBIS instabilities for the two samples. Therefore, the fundamental origin of the PBTS, NBTS, and NBIS instability of the a-IZTO TFTs seems to be mainly associated with the electronic structures of the bistable hydrogen impurities. \n2.2. Bistable Hydrogen In A-Izto\n In c-ZnO, it is well-known that each type of H impurity at the interstitial and substitutional sites exhibits two different charge states as a bistable center. [ 27,29,33,34 ] The shallow H i\nwhich is bonded to an O atom, is stable as a hydroxyl OH −[ 27 ] , and acceptor-like deep H i\n− , which is bonded to Zn atoms, is metastable at the hollow site. [ 33 ] On the other hand, when H is strongly combined with V O , shallow H O\n+ is stable in the form of a multicenter bond at the V O site, [ 29 ] and in the negative charge state, the deep H-DX − is stable compared to the H O\n+ with two additional electrons at conduction band minimum \n+ + 2e at CBM). [ 34 ] However, since the bistability of the hydrogen impurities in the amorphous phase may be different from those in the crystal, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to determine whether there are deep H \ncenters in a-IZTO or not. We fi nd that similarly to c-ZnO, there can be the acceptor-like deep H-related centers (H i\nin amorphous phase, which suggests that the deep H centers can be assigned as a major origin of the carrier-induced instabilities in the oxide TFTs, resulting in a negative shift of VTH . \nimpurities in a-IZTO, which are similar to those in c-ZnO. In fact, it was diffi cult to uniquely defi ne the interstitial and substitutional sites in the amorphous phase due to the lack of periodicity, and in principle, all the H impurities become different, indicating that the atomic and electronic structures of the H impurities are slightly or signifi cantly deviated with respect to the crystal phase. In this work, 9, 10, 9, and 6 confi gurations for each type, H i\n+ , and H-DX − , respectively, were sampled individually to statistically analyze \nwww.advelectronicmat.de **www.MaterialsViews.com**\n+ , and d) H-DX − in a-IZTO material.\nthe calculated results of H. Nevertheless, the structural and electronic characteristics of H i\n− and H-DX − in c-ZnO [ 33,34 ] were found to be qualitatively conserved in a-IZTO. The summarized results of four H type are shown in **Table** 2 . Figure 9 a,b shows that H i\n− for the interstitial case are bonded with O and cations atoms, respectively, because of the delicate balance of the Coulomb and quantum mechanical interactions between H \nand the host atoms (In 3+ , Sn 4+ , Zn 2+ , and O 2− ). For the substitutional case, while H O\n+ has Zn surrounding the location of the host O atom, as shown in Figure 9 c, the H in H-DX is largely displaced from on-site H O site into an interstitial H i one (leaving a V O ) through large lattice relaxation (LLR), resulting in a complex defect of V O\n− , as shown in Figure 9 d. Interestingly, as our expectation, H i\n− and H-DX − have deep impurity levels, as shown in **Figure** 10 a,b, whereas all the H i\nare shallow, which plays the role of donating an electron into the host. Moreover, because a-IZTO is an amorphous phase, Table 2. Summarized results including structural and electronic characteristics on four types of hydrogen impurities (i.e., H i\n| Defect type       | Charge state            | Type of neighboring   | Electronic impurity   |                |\n|-------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|----------------|\n| atoms (M = metal) | levels (eV) ( EC = CBM) |                       |                       |                |\n| H i +             | Interstitial            | +1                    | O–H                   | >EC            |\n| H i −             | Interstitial            | −1                    | M–H                   | about EC -2.45 |\n| +                 | Substitutional          | +1                    | M–H                   | >EC            |\n| H O H-DX −        | Substitutional          | −1                    | M–H                   | about EC -1.58 |\nwww.MaterialsViews.com **www.advelectronicmat.de**\nthe deep levels of H i\n− and H-DX − are located broadly above the VBM, as shown in Figure 10 c. The impurity levels of H i\n− are found to be distributed more widely and deeper compared to those of H-DX − . The average minimum excitation energies that are required for the direct transition of electrons from the impurity level to CBM were calculated separately to be 2.45 and 1.58 eV for H i\n− and H-DX − , respectively. Therefore, H-DX − is active compared to H i\n− on the visible light (low energy) illumination or the thermal excitation. \n To assess the thermal stability of each H impurity in a-IZTO, \nthe formation energy ( Ef ) was calculated using the following equation\n=−−Δ + ∑ Μ , F T I T P I E E E N Qe Ii F (6)\n where t i E is the total energy of a supercell containing the impurity (defect) with a q -charge state, t p E is the total energy of a perfect supercell, and Δni and µ i are the change in the number of atoms in the supercell and the chemical potential, respectively. \nFor the charged supercell calculations, the spurious monopole electrostatic interaction was corrected within the Makov and Payne scheme. [ 56 ] Here, it was considered to be the Oand H-rich condition, in which µ O and µ H are given by a half of the total energy of O 2 and H 2 molecules, respectively. The Fermi level ( EF ) is an electronic chemical potential, where the valence band maximum (VBM) is aligned to zero. Therefore, the position of EF corresponds to CBM when EF equals the band gap. Because of the underestimation of the calculated band gap \n![8_image_1.png](8_image_1.png) in the conventional DFT calculations, the band gap correction scheme was used to estimate Ef by applying the quasiparticle \n(QP) shifts of both the band edges, which are adjusted by the weight-average on the composition rate of a-IZTO (based on the QP shifts of the crystal In 2 O 3 , SnO 2 , and ZnO in ref. [ 57 ] to be the experimental band gap. The QP-shifted values for VBM and CBM, considering the difference between the experimental \n(3.19 eV) and theoretical (1.30 eV) optical band gaps, were calculated to be −0.48 and 1.41 eV, respectively. The relatively large QP shift of CBM in a-IZTO is consistent with that of amorphous InGaZnO 4 . \nFigure 11 shows the calculated formation energies, Ef s, of the four types of H impurities. Because the Ef s of each type in amorphous phase are distributed widely due to a defi ciency of periodicity, they were averaged out on the tested confi gurations of H i\n+ , and H-DX − , respectively, to show the deviation width for each type. The averaged thermal transition level, ε(+/−) av , from H i\n− (H-DX − ) was 2.79 (2.96) eV \nabove the VBM. Therefore, regardless of the existence of V O (O-chemical potential), in most regions of E F , H i\n+ are more stable than H i\n− and H-DX − , indicating that H can be one of the sources for n-type conductivity of a-IZTO. On the other \nwww.advelectronicmat.de **www.MaterialsViews.com**\n+ ). The solid red and blue lines denote the transitions from H i\nrespectively, in the negative charge state. The dashed red and blue lines indicate the energy curves for the structural transitions of H i and H O , \nrespectively, when the electrons are excited to the conduction band in the positive charge state.\n− and H-DX − were energetically comparable to H i\n+ when EF is close to CBM. Thus, this indicates that the H i\n− , and H-DX − states can coexist in the n-type semiconducting a-IZTO, depending on the growth and annealing conditions. Furthermore, remarkably, the ε(+/−) av of H i is found to be slightly lower than that of H O . In the semiconducting a-IZTO \nwith the carrier concentration of the 10 17 cm −3 order, which was located approximately (below) at CBM, the concentration of the deep H-DX − should be changed more sensitively than that of the deep H i\n− , because the difference in the Ef s between H O\nand H-DX − for H O is smaller than that for H i at EF . \n The total energy profi les of the structural transformation between the H i\n+ ) in the charge states of (+) \nand (−) were calculated. **Figure** 12 shows a schematic confi guration-energy diagram for the transition of the charge states between H i\n+ ). When the electrons at the deep H \nlevel are excited, the H i\n− (H-DX − ) structure is relaxed spontaneously to H i\n+ ) structure approximately with an energy barrier of zero ( Eα ≈ 0.0 eV). The energy barriers ( Eβ s) for the structural recovery from the H i\n− and H-DX − were estimated to be large within 1.05 < Eβ < 2.05 eV and small within 0.04 < Eβ < \n0.81 eV, respectively. The recovery of some structural deformation to the original states requires a signifi cant thermal energy barrier. \nIn particular, the energetic barrier for the transition from H i\n− exhibited a relatively large value compared to that from H O\n+ to H-DX − , because a strong O–H bond needs to be broken. \n2.3. Microscopic Mechanism Of Hydrogen On Electrical Instabilities In A-Izto\n The bistable hydrogen impurities can explain the microscopic origin of the negative or positive shifts of the VTH\nwith their fast or slow recovery processes under the NBTS \nor light stress conditions. As mentioned above, the H i\n− , and H-DX − (=V O\n− ) states can coexist in the a-IZTO \nsample, depending on the growth condition. Therefore, when external stresses, such as light illumination or negative electric fi eld, can cause electron excitation from deep H i\nstates to CBM, the large structural relaxation near the H site is instantly induced without an energy barrier (due to Eα ≈\n0.0 eV) as follows:\n+→ + − − ++ H (V H ) H (H ) 2E I O 0 I Io (7)\n Based on the H-transition mechanism, the H-donated electrons induce transient or persistent enhancement of the electron concentration in a-IZTO, resulting in the device instabilities (negative Vth shift). For the recovery process, when H i\n+ ) captures two mobile electrons at CBM, structural recovery from the H i\n− (H-DX − ) can be occurred as follows\n+→ + + + − − H (H ) 2E H (V H ) I O I O 0\n The NBTS-induced transition and PBTS-induced recovery energy barriers (see schematic total energy profi les in Figure 12 ) through the thermal process are distributed diversely for the H impurity, which indicates that the transition and recovery can occur with fast or slow times, depending on the H type and its local confi guration. \n First, the superior results for the Al 2 O 3 -inserted device in terms of the PBTS instabilities to the control device can be explained based on the hydrogen model. Because the application of PBTS on a-IZTO TFTs raises the EF toward the CBM, \n− (H-DX − ) charge state is favored compared to the H i\n+ ) charge state. Therefore, the prolonged PBTS duration on the a-IZTO TFTs causes conversion from the shallow H defect states (H i\n+ ) to the acceptor-like deep defect states (H i\nand H-DX − ). This EF -induced conversion process would consume the free electron carriers in the channel region, leading to a positive VTH shift in the resulting devices. Therefore, the superior PBTS stability of the Al 2 O 3 -inserted device was attributed to the lower existence (concentration) of shallow H defects states, which is corroborated with the results of Figure 4 a,b. \n Second, the NBTS and NBIS instabilities for both devices can also be understandable in the frame of the hydrogen model. When NBS is applied to the a-IZTO TFTs, the quasi-EF in the channel region near the gate dielectric/semiconductor interface moves the VBM downward due to the carrier depletion effect. The lowering of quasi- EF in the a-IZTO \nlayer facilitates the transformation from the H i\ncharge state to the H i\n+ ) charge state, which accompanies the capture of a hole carrier or emitting of an electron carrier (see Figure 11 ). These deep-to-shallow transitions of hydrogen impurities cause electron doping in the conduction band, leading to a negative V TH shift of the resulting devices. Therefore, the bistabilities of hydrogen impurities are the origin for the inferior instability of the control device under the NBTS and NBIS condition. \n Third, the large difference between the activation barriers of the control device and those of Al 2 O 3 -inserted device \nwww.MaterialsViews.com **www.advelectronicmat.de**\n![10_image_1.png](10_image_1.png)\nduring NBTS, as shown in Figures 7 and 8 , respectively, can be explained qualitatively by the bistable H i\nstates. This is based on the differently calculated properties of the thermal transition level (ε(+/−) av ), the H level within band gap, and the recovery energy barrier ( Eβ in Figure 12 ) \nfor both H types. The measured free electron concentration in the control device was higher than that in Al 2 O 3 -inserted device. In the control device with a high electron concentration (corresponding to a high value in ≈10 17 cm −3 ), EF lies at approximately 0.02 eV below the CBM (much closed to CBM), and in the Al 2 O 3 -inserted device with a low electron concentration (corresponding to a low value in ≈10 17 cm −3 ), \nthe EF lies at approximately 0.08 eV below the CBM. Therefore, although both H i\n− and H-DX − in the control device are possibly available, the formation energy of H-DX − in the Al 2 O 3 -inserted device is metastable with respect to H O\n+ , suggesting that the concentration of H-DX − is reduced drastically compared to the shallow H O\n+ state (see Figure 11 ). For this reason, by default, both H i\n− and H-DX − in the control device with a large H concentration coexist, whereas H i\nexists mainly in the Al 2 O 3 -inserted device with a small H \n For the transition energy barrier in NBTS to excite the electrons at the deep level without light illumination on both the control and Al 2 O 3 -inserted devices (Figure 7 ), instability occurs by thermal excitation from the deep state into the EF , and during the NBTS process, this can more easily occur due to the upward-bending of the electronic structures at the a-IZTO interface. It is noteworthy that the thermal excitation energy for H i\n− is largely required, compared to that of H-DX − because the impurity level of H i\n− (located at 2.45 eV below CBM) is deeper by 0.85 eV than that of H-DX − (located at 1.58 eV \nbelow CBM), as shown in Figure 10 and Table 2 . In the case of the control device having both H i\n− with large barriers and H-DX − with small barriers, the transition energy barrier would be more active by the low-barrier H-DX − because the transition of chemical state dominantly occurs along with a low energy pathway. On the other hand, the Al 2 O 3 -inserted device can be dominated by the transition of large-barrier H i\n− because H-DX − with small barriers is barely formed in the Al 2 O 3 -inserted device. This indicates that the transition energy barriers in the control device and Al 2 O 3 -inserted device are predominantly determined by H-DX − and H i\n− , respectively, which results in the higher transition energy barrier ( Eτ,NBTS ) of the Al 2 O 3 -inserted device compared to the control device. \nHowever, it is noted that it is diffi cult to quantitatively compare experimental results with theoretical ones because experimental measurements are performed under the conditions different from theoretical calculations (i.e., negative electric fi eld and corresponding quasi- EF ). Nevertheless, the signifi -\ncant difference (≈0.85 eV) in the averaged thermal excitation energy of H-DX − and H i\n− :0.85 eV is qualitatively consistent with the large difference (≈0.59 eV) in the activation energy barrier ( Eτ,NBTS ) for the control and Al 2 O 3 -inserted device, which were experimentally determined to be 0.31 and 0.90 eV, respectively. \n The recovery energy barrier qualitatively corresponds to the Eβ values in the → + ++ − − H (H ) H (V H ) i O iO\n0 i transitions, as shown in the confi gurational energy diagram of Figure 12 . \n![10_image_0.png](10_image_0.png)\nThe Eβ values for each type, interstitial H i and substitutional H O , were calculated to be largely separated. The reason for the different recovery barriers of both devices can also be attributed to the aforementioned rationale. In case of the control device with the coexistence of both H O and H i types, the recovery barrier ( Eτ,recovery ) is mostly determined by H-DX with low energy barriers. Conversely, H i with large energy barriers for the Al 2 O 3 -inserted device dictates the recovery process, which causes its Eτ,recovery value to be larger than that for the control device. The present recovery process was measured under an applied positive bias (Figure 8 ) to raise the EF near the interface. Compared to the Eβ values calculated without consideration of an externally applied positive bias (see Figure 12 ), the experimentally determined recovery barrier should decrease with increasing EF , suggesting that the experimental recovery barrier of 0.51 eV can be understood qualitatively by the positive-bias-induced reduction of the calculated Eβ values. \n In addition, bistable hydrogen impurities are at least an origin for the positive and negative VTH shift of the oxide TFTs in a variety of samples. Depending on the cation composition, the cation/anion ratio in the prepared semiconducting oxide fi lm and the integration processing condition, the major source of the instabilities can be considered differently, e.g., V O , peroxide (O 2 2− ) and O-interstitial. It is also noted that the gate fi eld-assisted generation and migration of ionic defects such as V O\n2+ , Zn i 2+ , and H i\n+ etc., can also partially contribute to the observed BTS-induced instabilities of the a-IZTO TFTs, [ 52,53,59 ] which was not fully considered in this study. In particular, these defect generation and migration during BTS duration can be accelerated under light illumination and elevated temperature because the incident photon and thermal energy into a-IZTO fi lm are likely to facilitate the creation and/or migration of the specifi c point defects. The combined experimental and theoretical study of BTS and light-induced defect creation and migration in metal oxide semiconductor is being conducted, which will be reported elsewhere. \n3. Conclusion\n The hydrogen-rich control a-IZTO TFTs exhibited a high µ SAT\nof 48.0 cm 2 Vs −1 , low SS of 0.15 V decade −1 , VTH of 0.4 V, and ION/OFF ratio of 10 9 . On the other hand, the µ SAT and VTH for the hydrogen-poor Al 2 O 3 -inserted a-IZTO TFTs were reduced to 20.5 cm 2 Vs −1 and increased to 1.4 V, which can be attributed to the lower n-type doping concentration of shallow hydrogen defects. The Al 2 O 3 -inserted a-IZTO TFTs showed much better stability than the control device under PBTS, NBTS, and NBIS conditions, indicating that the hydrogen-related defects have an adverse effect on the bias and photo-bias stabilities of the devices. The activation energies for NBTS and recovery behavior were extracted from the analysis based on the stretched exponential formula. The Eτ,NBTS and Eτ,recovery values for the control device were 0.31 and 0.10 eV, respectively whereas the signifi -\ncant larger Eτ,NBTS (0.9 eV) and Eτ,recovery (0.51 eV) values were obtained for the Al 2 O 3 -inserted device. The H i and H O in a-IZTO \nmaterial were calculated to be bistable centers with an electronic deep-to-shallow transition through large lattice relaxation. In case of control device, the H i\n− with large barrier and H-DX − with small barriers coexist due to the higher free electron concentration and thus elevated EF level closing to CBM. Therefore, the low-barrier H-DX − dictates the transition and recovery process, which resulted in the smaller Eτ,NBTS and Eτ,recovery values for the control device energy leading to the inferior gate bias stability. \nConversely, the Al 2 O 3 -inserted device is dominated by the transition of large-barrier H i\n− because H-DX − with small barriers are barely formed in the hydrogen-poor a-IZTO material, which is responsible for its higher Eτ,NBTS and Eτ,recovery values and thus, the superior gate-bias stability. These fi nding can provide a comprehensive single framework to understand the PBTS, NBTS, \nand NBIS instability of a-IZTO TFTs based on the simultaneous consideration of well-known V O (or O 2 2− , O i ) and hydrogen impurities. It is concluded that delicate controllability of hydrogen and balancing the anion/cation ratio are a key factor to achieve the high performance and stability of the metal oxide transistor. \n4. Experimental Section\nDevice Fabrication and Electrical Characterization : Figure 1 presents a schematic cross-section of an integrated a-IZTO TFT. The DC sputterderived molybdenum fi lm was patterned through the photolithography and wet etching process, which was used as the gate electrode on a glass substrate. The 300-nm-thick SiO 2 fi lm as a gate insulator \n(GI) was deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). For the active channel layer, a-IZTO fi lm was prepared by DC sputtering at room temperature with the target composition of In 2 O 3 :ZnO:SnO 2 = 40:40:20 at% and patterned by the photolithography and wet etch processes using diluted HF. A 200-nm-thick SiO 2 fi lm as an ESL was then coated by PECVD (control device). To control the level of hydrogen doping in the a-IZTO semiconductor, an additional 50-nm-thick Al 2 O 3 fi lm with an excellent barrier property against the hydrogen permeation was deposited on the ESL/a-IZTO/GI/Mo/glass substrate by rf sputtering, which is referred to as a-IZTO TFTs with a Al 2 O 3 interlayer. After defi ning the contact hole for the source/drain \n(S/D) electrode using photolithography and dry etching, the Mo fi lm as the S/D electrode was deposited by DC sputtering and patterned by the standard wet etching process. Finally, the 300-nm-thick SiO 2 was deposited as the passivation layers by PECVD, where the high silane fl ow rate of 150 sccm was used to provide high hydrogen content in the SiO 2 passivation layer. It is noted that this high SiH 4 fl ow rate for the PECVD-derived SiO 2 fi lm corresponds to the standard condition. After fabricating the a-IZTO TFTs, these devices were annealed at 350 °C for 60 min in a furnace. During thermal annealing, the hydrogen was expected to diffuse into the a-IZTO semiconductor through the ESL \nfrom the SiO 2 passivation layer. The channel width ( W ) and length ( L ) \nfor the a-IZTO TFTs investigated were 54 and 10 µm, and the gateto-S/D overlap length ( Lov ) was fi xed to 3 µm. The initial electrical characteristics including the transfer ( IDS - VGS ) and capacitance–voltage \n( C - V ) characteristics were measured at room temperature using an Agilent 4156 semiconductor parameter analyzer and HP 4294 LCR meter under a dark ambient conditions. The SIMS depth profi les using the Bi + primary ion beams with energies of 25 keV–1 pA were obtained to compare the relative level of hydrogen incorporation in the IZTO semiconductor fi lm for both devices. \nTheoretical Calculation : The DFT calculations of a-IZTO were performed using the Vienna ab inito simulation package (VASP) with the projector-augmented wave (PAW) pseudopotential, and the PBE \nfunctional was used to calculate the exchange-correlation energy. Firstprinciples molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out to obtain the amorphous structure. To generate the fi nal amorphous \nwww.advelectronicmat.de **www.MaterialsViews.com**\n![11_image_0.png](11_image_0.png)\nstructure more effi ciently, the atoms in a cubic supercell were fi rst distributed randomly with the constraints on the bond lengths between M–M, M–O, and O–O, which allows shortening of the melting time. A \nsupercell containing 10 formula units of In 2 SnZn 2 O 7 was constructed and heated to 3000 K for 10 ps and cooled rapidly to 300 K at a rate of −300 K ps −1 . The fi nal amorphous structure was obtained by full relaxation of the cell volume and atomic positions. \n For the structural relaxation and electronic structure calculation, on-site Coulomb energy (U) was added for the localized d electrons of metals, which partially corrects the band gap underestimation of the conventional DFT calculation in this material by reducing the repulsion interaction between O-p and M-d. The U values of In-d, Sn-d, and Zn-d were 5.0, 3.5, and 7.5 eV, respectively. The kinetic energy cutoff of the plane wave basis was 500 eV and the single k -point of (0.25, 0.25, 0.25) was used. The k -point convergence was tested, and the total energy deviation was within 10 meV per atom. \nReceived: November 3, 2014 Revised: February 14, 2015 Published online: May 8, 2015 \n![11_image_1.png](11_image_1.png)\n K.

Introduction\nOxide thin-film transistors (TFTs) have been extensively studied for display applications using various materials, structures, and process-based methods owing to their high charge mobility, superior optical transparency, low fabrication cost, and operational stability.1–3 Consequently, oxide TFTs have been applied in various devices such as display panels of active matrix liquid crystals or active matrix organic light emitting diodes, driving circuits of finger recognition sensors, X-ray sensors, chemical sensors and gas sensors.4–7 Although several single-layered oxide TFTs with electron mobilities exceeding 10 cm2 V1 s\n-1 have recently been reported, disordered structural networks and inherent defects in oxide semiconductor materials significantly affect the electrical performance of oxide TFTs and limit their application in next-generation electronic devices.8–11 Therefore, new approaches for developing oxide TFTs with significantly higher electron mobilities have been proposed and demonstrated.12–14 Among the several strategies for improving the performance of oxide TFTs, the heterojunction approach of the channel layer has been reported as an effective strategy.15–17 Although the exact mechanism for performance improvement is still under debate, typically it is explained that the conduction-band offset due to the energy-level difference between two adjacent semiconductor layers, e.g., a front and back-channel oxide layer with a higher and lower work function, respectively, induces charge\n **View Journal | View Issue**\nHeterojunction Oxide Thin Film Transistors: A Review Of Recent Advances Juhyeok Lee And Dae Sung Chung *\nIn the last decades, oxide thin-film transistors (TFTs) have been extensively developed for optoelectronic applications owing to their outstanding electrical properties, such as excellent optical transparency and high thermal stability. Among various oxide TFTs, heterojunction oxide TFTs are regarded as notable materials because they simultaneously exhibit high charge mobility and excellent operational stability through the formation of a charge-accumulation layer. This review focuses on recent advances in heterojunction oxide TFTs. First, a fundamental understanding of the electronic structures, operations, defect chemistry, charge-accumulation mechanisms, and charge-transport mechanisms of oxide TFTs is presented. Subsequently, an overview of the recent research advances in heterojunction oxide TFTs based on various deposition methods, including vacuum and solution processing, is presented. In particular, the mechanisms of the charge-accumulation layer formation and basic characteristics of heterojunction oxide TFTs are reviewed. Finally, the prospects for heterojunction oxide TFTs are discussed.\naccumulation at the heterointerface, resulting in a high charge mobility of oxide TFTs.18 Such heterojunction approaches started to be reported for vacuum-deposited TFTs with several advantages, such as high deposition rate, high uniformity, and easy thin-film deposition control. For example, GaAs/AlGaAs heterojunction TFTs use charge accumulation at the heterointerface to achieve high carrier mobilities determined by phonon scattering without impurity scattering in the semiconductor.19–21 Furthermore, ZnMgO/ZnO is representative example of an oxide heterojunction that uses the chargeaccumulation mechanism. The front channel, ZnMgO, enables charge accumulation at the heterointerface owing to the band bending through the large conduction-band offset and polar surface.22 Recently, He et al. showed vacuum-processed IGZO/\nIn2O3 heterojunction oxide TFTs with high electron mobility of 64.4 cm2 V1 s\n23 Typically, in a heterojunction structure, the front channel provides high charge mobility, whereas the back channel maintains a low off-current interaction to realize highperformance oxide TFTs.24 Followed by successful demonstration of vacuum-deposited heterojunction TFTs, solution-process was also applied for the heterojunction TFTs with advantages of low manufacturing costs, high throughput, and easy chemical composition control. Faber et al. showed solution-processed In2O3/\nZnO heterojunction oxide TFTs with high electron mobility of up to B45 cm2 V1 s\n25 Therefore, the heterojunction oxide TFTs can achieve excellent electrical characteristics from both the vacuum- and solution-deposited layers.\nThis review provides an overview on the fundamental understanding of oxide TFTs and recent advances in high-performance Department of Chemical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology\nIn particular, we focused on the charge-accumulation mechanism at the heterointerface built by the conduction-band offset in the heterojunction structure. We then provide an overview of recent research advances in heterojunction oxide TFTs based on various deposition methods, including vacuum and solution processes.\nFinally, we summarize the current state of research for heterojunction oxide TFTs, and discussed its outlook.\n2. Fundamentals Of Oxide Tft\n![1_Image_0.Png](1_Image_0.Png) 2.1. Principle Of Oxide Tft\n2.1.1. Device structure. TFTs are three-terminal devices with their configurations classified according to the positions of the semiconductor, gate, and source/drain electrodes. The source and drain electrodes are in direct contact with the semiconductor, whereas the gate is separated from the semiconductor layer using a dielectric layer. The most common TFT structures are shown in Fig. 1. Depending on whether the source/drain and gate electrode are on the same or opposite side of the semiconductor, the structures are identified as staggered bottom-gate, coplanar bottom-gate, staggered topgate, and coplanar top-gate, which represent bottom-gate topcontact, bottom-gate bottom-contact, top-gate top-contact, and top-gate bottom-contact, respectively.5,26 Staggered bottom-gate structures are commonly used in the fabrication and research of TFTs owing to their ease of processing, single patterning, and excellent electrical properties (Fig. 1(a)).27 In addition, they are advantageous for LCD\napplications because the gate electrode of the TFT protects the semiconductor material from the backlight effects of the display. However, the semiconductor channel can be damaged by the subsequent patterning of source/drain electrodes or backchannel etching.5 A coplanar bottom gate can prevent damage to the back-channel surfaces owing to the subsequent patterning of source/drain electrodes, but suffers from performance degradation owing to the higher contact resistance with a small implantation area and rough morphology of the semiconductor active layer near the pre-patterned S/D electrodes (Fig. 1(b)).\nTo overcome these limitations, devices can be encapsulated with passivation layers, such as SiO2, Al2O3, and CYTOP, and an etch stopper can be introduced to protect the back channel from the etching effects, thereby improving the accuracy during the etching of source/drain electrodes and device performance.26 The staggered and coplanar top-gate structures enable selfencapsulation, where a dielectric layer covers the semiconductor layer to reduce performance degradation due to oxygen and moisture (Fig. 1(c) and (d)). In particular, a staggered top-gate TFT provides a large contact area for charge injection, resulting in a low contact resistance.28,29 However, during the thermal deposition of the metal gate electrode, metal atoms can penetrate the dielectric, resulting in a high leakage current.\nMoreover, the deposition of the dielectric layer can damage the underlying semiconductor, thereby causing severe carrier scattering at the semiconductor/dielectric interface.28–30 Therefore, top-gate structures require delicate and precise fabrication processes.\n2.1.2. Operation of TFT. The representative parameters for evaluating the performance of oxide TFTs include the carrier mobility, current on/off ratio, threshold voltage, and subthreshold swing (SS), which are extracted from the IDS–VGS transfer curves and IDS–VDS output curves, as shown in Fig. 2.\na. Carrier mobility. Carrier mobility is an important parameter in oxide TFTs because it indicates the efficiency of carrier transport in a material under an electric field. This parameter is usually expressed in cm2 V1 s\n-1. As the mobility increases, the average carrier drift per unit of electric field increases, and the device power consumption for the same current decreases, thereby increasing the response speed of the TFT.31 Carrier mobility is affected by several scattering mechanisms, such as lattice vibrations, ionized impurities, grain boundaries, surface roughness, and other structural defects.5 Carrier mobility can be varied as a function of VDS and VGS, and can be classified into several types, namely effective, field-effect, and saturation mobility.32 Effective mobility (meff) is defined as the output conductance in the linear region with low VDS, which is obtained by the equation:\n$$\\mu_{\\mathrm{eff}}={\\frac{g_{\\mathrm{d}}}{C_{\\mathrm{i}}{\\frac{W}{L}}(V_{\\mathrm{GS}}-V_{\\mathrm{TH}})}},$$\nwhere gd is the conductance, Ci is the capacitance, W is the channel width, L is the channel length, VGS is the gate–source voltage, and VTH is the threshold voltage. To obtain meff, VTH\nshould be determined, and the effect of VGS is included.\nField-effect mobility (mFE) is defined as the transconductance in the linear region with low VDS, as obtained by the equation:\n$$\\mu_{\\mathrm{FE}}={\\frac{g_{\\mathrm{m}}}{C_{\\mathrm{i}}{\\frac{W}{L}}V_{\\mathrm{DS}}}},\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad(2)$$\nwhere gm is the transconductance and VDS is the drain–source voltage. Unlike meff, mFE does not require VTH and can be easily calculated using the derivative of the transfer characteristic.\nSaturation mobility (msat) is the transconductance in the saturation region with high VDS, as follows:\n$$\\mu_{\\mathrm{sat}}={\\frac{2L}{W C_{\\mathrm{i}}}}\\biggl({\\frac{\\mathrm{d}{\\sqrt{I_{\\mathrm{DS}}}}}{\\mathrm{d}V_{\\mathrm{GS}}}}\\biggr)^{2},\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad(3)$$\nwhere IDS is the drain–source current. msat assumes that the channel is pinched-off. Moreover, it does not require VTH and is less sensitive to contact resistance.\nb. Current on/off ratio. The current on/off ratio is defined as the ratio of the maximum to the minimum IDS, which can be extracted from the saturation region of the transfer characteristic curve. The minimum IDS depends on the noise level of the measuring instrument or gate leakage current and affects the power consumption of the device. Meanwhile, the maximum IDS depends on the semiconductor material and effectiveness of the capacitance due to the field effect.5 An on/off ratio of above 107 is typically required for successful application as an electronic switch.\nc. Threshold voltage. The threshold voltage (VTH) refers to the magnitude of the gate voltage at the transition of a TFT from the cut-off state to the ON state.32 For n-type TFTs, the device is assigned to either enhancement or depletion mode depending on the positive or negative VTH. Among these, the enhancement mode is preferred because it simplifies the circuit design and minimizes power consumption because no additional compensation circuitry is required to regulate VTH.\n33 Generally, as VTH\ndecreases, the TFT conductivity increases, which improves the performance of the TFT.32 d. Subthreshold swing. SS quantifies the speed at which a transistor is turned off by the gate voltage, which is defined as the change in the gate voltage required to induce a change in the drain-current in one decade. SS is calculated as follows:5\n$$\\mathbf{SS}=\\left({\\frac{\\partial\\log I_{\\mathrm{DS}}}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{GS}}}}\\right|_{\\operatorname*{max}}\\right)^{-1}$$\nAs the SS value decreases, the operating speed increases, while the power consumption decreases. The SS value can then be reduced by applying a specific bias voltage and reducing the trap states at the semiconductor/dielectric interface.17 2.1.3. Chemistry of the defects and impurities. A defect is defined as a deviation from an ideally perfect crystal and is used as the thermodynamic standard state.32 As unintentional defects in heterojunction oxide TFTs affect electronic properties, such as mobility and VTH, create deep-level in-gap states, and affect optical properties, reducing the defects is critical to TFT device characteristics.\nDefects in the spatial region include foreign interstitials, foreign substitutions, stacking faults, self-interstitials, vacancies, edge dislocations, and precipitates, as shown in Fig. 3(a).\nMeanwhile, defects in the energy band diagram include shallow impurities of dopant atoms and deep-level impurities of generation–recombination centers.32 Generation–recombination centers, known as deep-energylevel impurities, lie deep in the bandgap. They act as recombination centers when there are excess carriers in the semiconductor and generation centers when the carrier density is below the equilibrium value. The generation–recombination process follows several capture and release processes (Fig. 3(b)), in which the center first captures an electron in the conduction band, described by the coefficient cn, and then releases the electron back into the conduction band, en, or captures holes in the valence band, cp. Subsequently, the generation–recombination center is occupied by a hole and emits a hole or captures an electron back to the valence band, known as ep. Therefore, whether an impurity acts as a trap or a generation–recombination center is determined by ET, position of the Fermi level in the bandgap, temperature, and trapping cross-section of the impurity.\nImpurities with energies near the middle of the bandgap act as generation–recombination centers, whereas those with energies near the band edges act as traps.32 Oxygen vacancies are among the most common defects in oxide TFTs. Oxygen vacancies are created by changes in the chemical environment, such as annealing, laser irradiation, and growth conditions. In addition, oxygen vacancies are formed by several mechanisms, including the formation during crystal growth and the formation to compensate for the charge introduced by dopants.34,35 In particular, depending on local structures, oxygen vacancies are classified as either deep electron traps or a shallow donors. Deep electron traps are formed when oxygen vacancies are adjacent to open spaces or coordinated by a small number of cations in corner-sharing networks where one oxygen is located between two polyhedral. In contrast, shallow donor states are formed when oxygen vacancies are coordinated by a large number of cations in an edge-sharing networks sharing two oxygens between two polyhedra or a face-sharing networks sharing three or more oxygens between polyhedra (Fig. 3(c)). If there is a large amount of open space\ndue to corner-sharing networks exists in the vacancy site, oxygen vacancies form deep electron traps in the bandgap and ionize under visible light. The ionized oxygen vacancies migrate to the interface with dielectric under negative bias and become hole-trapping sites. Therefore, it impairs the electrical characteristics of the TFT by confining the charges in the active layer. Deep states formed in open spaces are at energies just above the valence band maximum, whereas shallow donor states are formed when open spaces are annihilated by the growth conditions, device structure, and thermal annealing.34,36 Therefore, it is important to increase the number of shallow donors by eliminating open spaces through the aforementioned treatments to produce high-quality heterojunction oxide TFTs with minimal defects. The heterojunction oxide TFT structure induces charge accumulation at the heterointerface by band bending, suppressing oxygen vacancies at the semiconductor/dielectric interface, and improving the charge mobility and stability of the device\n2.2. Charge Accumulation\nThe introduction of heterostructures with two or more semiconductor channel materials can realize high mobility values that surpass those of devices with a single semiconductor channel. Combining two materials with sufficiently large conduction-band offsets can form a potential well at the heterointerface, where electrons can be confined to form a charge-accumulation layer.37,38 Charge accumulation refers to a state in which electrons have quantized energy levels in one spatial direction perpendicular to the interface but can move freely in the other two spatial directions.39 Additional electrons can migrate to the potential well by modulation doping, which increases the electron density in the charge-accumulation layer and physically separates the ionized donors from the charge carriers. Therefore, the effect of impurity scattering is minimized, thereby allowing the carrier mobility to reach values greater than those measured for bulk semiconductors that from heterojunctions.16 This charge-accumulation mechanism can be demonstrated in the heterojunction structure of ZnMgO/ZnO at thermal equilibrium. ZnO can be heavily doped with n-type dopants, whereas ZnMgO can be lightly doped n-type or intrinsic. In the ZnO layer, the positive polarization charge at the heterointerface and negative polarization charge on the top surface induce an electric field with the Fermi level and tilts the energy band toward the heterointerface. Under an electric field, the conductive electrons in ZnO move towards the positive electrode and accumulate, bending the energy band and flattening the Fermi level. The built-in electric field also reduces the overall electric field in the channel layers, flattening the tilted energy band. When in contact with ZnMgO, the lower Fermi level of ZnMgO than that of ZnO prompts the electrons on the ZnO to side flow into ZnMgO to form a charge-accumulation layer, thereby equalizing the Fermi energies of ZnO and ZnMgO, as shown in Fig. 4(a).40 In a heterojunction structure, the front channel layer with a higher work function can provide a higher carrier concentration owing to its high conductivity, thereby forming the maximum charge accumulation to achieve high mobility. In contrast, the carrier concentration in the back channel layer with a lower work function is considerably lower than that in the front channel layer, resulting in an electron activation energy difference between the conduction band minimum (CBM) and the Fermi levels, thereby forming an energy barrier at the interface.41 Therefore, the energy barrier allows the effective control of the electron flow of the backchannel layer to reduce the off-current and adjust VTH.\n42 The charge neutrality level (CNL) is the energy level at which the surface state is electrically neutral. Oxide materials can be classified as donor types if the energy level of surface state is higher than the EF and as acceptor types if the energy level of surface state is lower than the EF. In n-type oxide materials, such as In2O3, ZnO, SnO2, and Ga2O3, the CNL exists above the CBM because of its low energy formed by the metal s-orbitals, as shown in Fig. 4(b).43 The formation of the charge accumulation layer is related to the relative energy difference between CBM and CNL. For example, In2O3 exhibits downward band bending and electron accumulation because its surface state becomes donor-like due to a lower CBM compared to CNL.\nIn contrast, Ga2O3 exhibits upward band bending and electron depletion due to higher CBM compared to CNL. The In2O3/\nGa2O3 heterojunction structure can generate significant electron accumulation at the In2O3 interface, thereby improving the electrical characteristics of the device.43 Therefore, using\nvarious material combinations based on the relative energy difference with CNL, heterojunction oxide TFTs with charge accumulation can be fabricated.\nHeterojunction structures not only increase the mobility through charge accumulation, but also improve bias-stress stability compared to single-layer devices. To enhance biasstress stability, it is important to reduce defects in the film caused by imperfect metal–oxide–metal (M–O–M) formation, residual film porosity, or impurities. Defects in the thin film can be reduced through various methods such as new precursor design, high process temperature, and doping, but this can also be accompanied by a decrease in mobility. Therefore, it is challenging to simultaneously achieve high mobility and high stability in a single layer. On the other hand, heterojunction oxide TFTs combine a front channel layer with high mobility and high carrier concentration and a back channel layer with lower mobility but higher stability. This strategy is remarkable as the high carrier concentration of the front channel helps to passivate the traps at the front/back channel interface, while the back channel layer minimizes oxygen adsorption and separates the charge transport channel from interacting with the gas molecules on top surface.44 Lee et al. fabricated ITZO/IGZO\nheterojunction oxide TFT with high mobility and high operational stability, and confirmed that the charge traps present at the semiconductor/dielectric interface and the back channel are passivated by the front channel with high carrier concentration and the back channel with high stability, respectively.16\n2.3. Charge-Transport Mechanism\n2.3.1. Trap-limited transport. For nanocrystalline oxide TFTs, the electrical conductivity is mainly limited by the electron-trapping sites between the nanocrystalline domain boundaries. Therefore, in this trap-limited transport, it is assumed that most free electrons are trapped in localized states, and only a small number of electron hopping from the localized states to the transport bands by thermal energy transiently contribute to the electrical conduction, as shown in Fig. 5(a).45 In the band diagram of the oxide TFT with an\nexponential distribution of the local tail states and potential barrier over conduction band minimum (Em), as shown in Fig. 5(b), carrier transport is controlled by trap-limited transport when the Fermi level is within the localized tail state.\n46 The traps in the thin film impede the movement of the charges, and the mobility is proportional to nfree/(nfree +\nntrap), where nfree and ntrap are the free and trap carrier densities, respectively.\n2.3.2. Percolation-limited transport. In contrast to nanocrystalline oxides, electron transport in amorphous-oxide TFTs is controlled by thermally activated electron hopping between adjacent metal ions that hold electrons. When an external electric field is applied to amorphous-oxide TFTs, electrons flow through percolation-limited transport pathways placed on the metal ions, according to a variable-range hopping percolation model, as shown in Fig. 5(c).45 When the EF\nlies between Em and conduction band maximum (EM), the tail state is filled, thereby mFE is controlled only by percolationlimited transport, not by trap-limited transport. Charge transport in the localized state is primarily controlled by traplimited transport, whereas carriers released in the delocalized state migrate along the path of least resistance among potential barriers (Fig. 5(b)).46 Therefore, the external electric field induces band bending and changes the barrier height at the interface.\n2.3.3. Gate capacitance-dependent field-effect mobility.\nTrap- and percolation-limited transport can be simultaneously observed depending on the gate capacitance modulation.\nHowever, the transition between the two limits remains unclear, which is presumably affected by several variables, such as the TFT process conditions and materials used. Generally, the transition point can be considered as the percolation threshold, which is the value of VGS, where EF = Em, as shown in Fig. 5(d).46 Therefore, Lee et al. computed nfree and ntrap using the Fermi–Dirac statistic to accurately estimate this transition point. They confirmed that ntrap becomes considerably larger than nfree when VGS decreases below percolation threshold voltage Vp; thus, trap-limited transport is dominant.\nBy contrast, when VGS exceeds Vp, nfree becomes significantly larger than ntrap. In addition, if the EF is greater than Em, all the trap states are filled such that nfree/(nfree + ntrap) = 1, resulting in percolation-limited transport (Fig. 5(e)).46–48 Therefore, as the charge concentration in the channel layer increases, the number of traps decreases and charge-transport mechanism changes from trap- to percolation-limited transport, thereby improving the oxide TFT device performance.\nLiang et al. analyzed the charge-transport mechanisms of single-layer and heterojunction oxide TFTs. As shown in Fig. 5(f), the charge transport in the heterojunction oxide TFT\nappeared to be dominated by percolation-limited transport. In contrast, charge transport in a single-layer oxide TFT is dominated by trap-limited transport caused by traps within the film.\nThey confirmed that carriers accumulate in the front channel layer of the heterojunction structure to avoid more traps, whereas carriers in the single-layer structure are restricted from conducting by the increased number of traps.49\n3. Heterojunction Oxide Tft 3.1. Vacuum-Processed Heterojunction Oxide Tfts\nThe vacuum process has been studied because of its high potential for mass production considering its processing advantages, such as a high deposition rate, high uniformity, and easy thin-film composition control. Table 1 and Fig. 6 summarize recent advances in vacuum-processed heterojunction oxide TFTs.\nAs a pioneering work, Kim et al. first fabricated IZO (or ITO)/\nGIZO heterojunction oxide TFTs in 2008 by magnetron sputtering at room temperature, thereby obtaining a high electron mobility of 51.3 cm2 V1 s 1, high on/off ratio of B109, and low VTH of 0.31 V under a bias voltage of 10 V. The high carrier density of the front channel layer induced high mobility and that the back-channel layer could control VTH.\n50 The introduction of this heterojunction structure provided a novel method to significantly improve the electrical characteristics of oxide TFTs. Thus, several studies were conducted regarding this pioneering work.\nIn 2010, Park et al. fabricated high-performance and highly stable TFTs using a Hf content-modulated bilayer channel by magnetron sputtering at room temperature, resulting in a high on/off ratio of B1010 and low DVTH of -2.55 V, against a long bias-stress time of 11 000 s, as shown in Fig. 6(a). The Hf content of HIZO was a critical factor in determining the stability of the device and its electrical properties, which demonstrated a trade-off between the device performance and stability.51 In 2012, Wang et al. fabricated In2O3/Ga2O3 heterojunction oxide TFTs by magnetron sputtering at o60 1C, thereby obtaining a high electron mobility of 51.3 cm2 V1 s\n-1, high on/off ratio of B108, low VTH of 0.57 V, and low SS of 0.38 V dec-1, as shown in Fig. 6(b).52 In 2014, Chung et al. fabricated ITO/IGZO\nheterojunction oxide TFTs with a high electron mobility of B80 cm2 V-1 s\n-1, high on/off ratio of B108, and low offcurrent of less than 10-11 A using magnetron sputtering. They confirmed that the implementation of an ultrathin ITO layer as a hole-damping layer improved the electron mobility and stability of the heterojunction oxide TFTs (Fig. 6(c)).53 In 2021, Lee et al. fabricated a-SIZO/a-SZTO heterojunction oxide TFTs with a high electron mobility of 160.4 cm2 V1 s-1 by magnetron sputtering. They also used a structure similar to previous studies but found that the electrical properties of the bilayer structure were dominated by the position of the conductive layer, where the main current path was formed, rather than the carrier concentration of the total channel.54 In 2022, AlGhamdi et al. fabricated In2O3/ZnO heterojunction oxide TFTs using magnetron sputtering with a high electron mobility of 450 cm2 V-1 s\n-1, high on/off ratio of B108, and low VTH of\n-6.3 V. They confirmed that the thickness of the channel layer is nearly independent of the electron concentration in the channel, but the VTH can be significantly reduced by optimizing the thickness of individual layer. This demonstrates the variation of the electrical properties of heterojunction oxide TFTs with relative thickness between front and back channel layers.55 Kim et al. successfully fabricated IGZO/IZO heterojunction\n| Table 1                         | Recent advances in vacuum-processed heterojunction oxide TFTs   |        |          |         |       |      |      |\n|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------|----------|---------|-------|------|------|\n| Channel                         | Dielectric                                                      | Mobility (cm2 V1 s 1 )        | Ion/Ioff | VTH (V) | SS (V dec1 )       | Year | Ref. |\n| IZO/GIZO                        | SiO2                                                            | 51.3   | B109     | 0.31    | 0.19  | 2008 | 50   |\n| ITO/GIZO                        | SiO2                                                            | 104    | B108     | 0.50    | 0.25  | 2008 | 50   |\n| GIZO/CGIZO                      | SiNx                                                            | 5.1    | B107     | 3.25    | 0.68  | 2009 | 60   |\n| ITO/ZTO                         | SiO2                                                            | 52     | B108     | 1.0         | -

In comparison to the magnetron sputtering process, ALD is easier to control the thickness and can form uniform thin films due to its excellent film applicability. They confirmed that efficient thickness control using ALD is a promising strategy for fabricating highmobility and high-reliability heterojunction oxide TFTs.56 Meanwhile, in heterojunction oxide TFTs, several studies have reported that doping the back channel of the semiconductor layers suppresses the trap density at the semiconductor/\ndielectric layer interface, thereby improving the charge mobility and stability of oxide TFTs. In 2014, Hsu et al. used magnetron sputtering to fabricate IGZO/IGZO:Ti heterojunction oxide TFTs with a high electron mobility of 63 cm2 V1 s1, low off current of 1.6  1011 A, and low SS of 0.073 V dec1 at a low drive voltage of 2 V. Ti used as a dopant has a high bond enthalpy with O, thereby creating oxygen vacancies in the IGZO layer and acting as a charge-accumulation layer; however, it also acts as a passivation layer to reduce gate leakage.57 In 2016, Abliz et al.\nfabricated polycrystalline ZnO:H/ZnO heterojunction oxide TFTs by magnetron sputtering to obtain a high electron mobility of 42.6 cm2 V1 s\n-1, high on/off ratio of 108, and low SS of 0.13 V dec1. They confirmed that the front channel of the hydrogenated ultrathin ZnO:H layer could provide a high carrier concentration and reduce the interface trap density between the semiconductor and dielectric layers, whereas the back channel of the thick pure ZnO layer could control the channel conductance (Fig. 6(d)).58 The dielectric layer plays a critical role in improving carrier mobility in oxide TFTs. Although SiO2 is one of the most reliable dielectrics because of its high-quality and defect-free\nfilms, dielectrics with a low leakage current should be developed to satisfy the increasing request for high-performance devices with low power consumption. Therefore, several studies on the development of heterojunction oxide TFTs using vacuumprocessed high-k dielectrics, such as Al2O3 and HfO2, have been reported. In 2014, Lee et al. developed ZnO/SnO2 heterojunction oxide TFT using pulsed laser deposition with Al2O3 as a gate dielectric, thereby achieving the electron mobility of 37 cm2 V-1 s\n-1, a high on/off ratio of 1010, and a low SS of 0.19 V dec-1.\n59 In 2019, He et al. fabricated IGZO/In2O3 heterojunction oxide TFT using magnetron sputtering with HfO2 as a gate dielectric, with a high electron mobility of 67.5 cm2 V1 s 1, a high on/off ratio of 107, and a low SS of 0.085 V dec1. They confirmed that high-k dielectric layers deposited by ALD showed high stability, combined with a heterojunction structure and exhibited high electrical characteristics even at low driving voltages.23 Collectively, most of the vacuum-processed heterojunction oxide TFTs were fabricated by magnetron sputtering and ALD,\nwhich enable the integration of the characteristics of both the front and back-channel layers. This demonstrates the significant improvement in the electrical characteristics of vacuumprocessed heterojunction oxide TFTs, compared to single-layer oxide TFTs. Thus, several studies have steadily reported using this heterojunction structure.\n3.2. Solution-Processed Heterojunction Oxide Tfts\nRecently, solution processing has been actively studied owing to its advantages, such as low manufacturing costs, high throughput, and easy chemical composition control. The solution-processed thin-film fabrication process can be classified into two categories: direct growth of materials without additional processing on the substrate during deposition, such as electrochemical and electroless chemical bath deposition, and liquid coating, which requires additional processing to remove the solvent and obtain the desired phase, such as spin coating, dip coating, and spray coating (Fig. 7).92 Among these, spin coating has been widely used to fabricate heterojunction oxide TFT because it is suitable for nanoparticle-based, sol–gel, and hybrid-type processes, thereby enabling the rapid deposition of oxide films. Table 2 and Fig. 8 summarize the recent advances in solution-processed heterojunction oxide TFTs.\nIn 2011, Kim et al. first fabricated IZO/AIZO heterojunction oxide TFTs by spin coating, achieving a high electron mobility of 1.57 cm2 V1 s1, high on/off ratio of B107, VTH of 0.5 V, and SS of 0.59 V dec1. They found that a thin front channel induced a higher electron concentration at the semiconductor/dielectric interface, resulting in high charge accumulation for high electron mobility, and the thick back channel controlled the increased charge conductance, resulting in a suitable VTH.\n93 The introduction of this solution-processed heterojunction structure provides a new strategy for significantly improving the electrical characteristics of oxide TFTs using a simple and inexpensive process. Thus, several subsequent studies used solutionprocessed heterojunction structures. In 2014, Rim et al. fabricated ITZO/IGZO heterojunction oxide TFTs by confining the ITZO layer to IGZO via spin coating, resulting in a high electron mobility of\n| Table 2                | Recent advances in solution-processed heterojunction oxide TFTs   |       |          |       |       |      |     |\n|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|----------|-------|-------|------|-----|\n| Channel                | Dielectric                                                        | Mobility (cm2 V1 s       |          |       |       |      |     |\n| IZO/AIZO               | SiO2                                                              | 1.57  | B107     | 1.28  | 0.59  | 2011 | 93  |\n| IZO/AIZO               | SiO2                                                              | 5.62  | B107     | 9.11  | 0.53  | 2012 | 42  |\n| IGZO/ZTO               | SiO2                                                              | 2.09  | B107     | 2.72  | 0.49  | 2013 | 101 |\n| In2O3/IGO              | SiO2                                                              | 2.6   | B108     | 0     | -

They found that the effective control of electron flow by the heterointerfacial barrier and high-quality ITZO films improved the mobility and stability of the heterojunction TFT (Fig. 8(a)).94 In 2017, Faber et al. used sequential deposition of ultrasonic spray pyrolysis and spin coating to obtain an In2O3/ZnO heterojunction oxide TFT with a high electron mobility of 45 cm2 V1 s\noff ratio of 107. In2O3/ZnO TFT exhibited a band-like transport with considerably higher electron mobility than that of singlelayer TFTs. This is attributed to the confinement of free electrons at the sharp heterointerface planes caused by the large conduction band offset between In2O3 and ZnO layers. This finding\n![10_image_0.png](10_image_0.png)\ndemonstrates the potential for widespread technological applications in engineering solution-processed oxide heterointerfaces as an alternative strategy for the development of oxide TFTs.25 Similar to the vacuum process, several efforts have been made to further increase the amount of charge accumulation at the heterointerface between the semiconductor layers by changing the energy level of the semiconductor layer using various doping methods, including solution and sublimation. In 2014, Seo et al. fabricated IZO:Al/IZO heterojunction oxide TFTs with an electron mobility of 23.4 cm2 V1 s 1, on/off ratio of B107, and SS of 0.27 V dec1. The Al atom acts as an effective suppressor of the formation of oxygen vacancies at the semiconductor/dielectric interface by forming strong metal oxide networks.95 Using a similar strategy, in 2017, Khim et al.\nobtained In2O3/Li-doped ZnO heterojunction oxide TFTs with an electron mobility of 11.4 cm2 V1 s\n-1, on/off ratio of B105, and VTH of 2.12 V by spin coating. Li addition to ZnO resulted in n-type solution doping and enabled precise tuning of the Fermi energy. Similar to modulation doping, the n-doped ZnO layer increases the number of electrons transferred from the CBM to the conduction band of In2O3 through the heterointerface\n(Fig. 8(b)). These findings demonstrate that high-performance TFTs can be developed by inducing larger band bending through the metal doping of the back channel in heterojunction oxide TFT.96 In 2019, Chen et al. fabricated In2O3/PEI–\nIn2O3 heterojunction oxide TFTs by spin coating, resulting in a high electron mobility of 10.05 cm2 V1 s 1, on/off ratio of B106, and VTH of 3.2 V. They confirmed that polymer solution doping can effectively tune the Fermi level of In2O3, forming a charge-accumulation layer via the Fermi energy-level alignment between the semiconductor layers and providing a superior morphology (Fig. 8(c)).97 In 2021, Lee et al. fabricated In2O3/\nZnO heterojunction oxide TFTs by spin coating with the sublimation doping of amidine-based organic bases (Fig. 8(d)),\nresulting in a high electron mobility of 17.8 cm2 V1 s\n-1. They found that sublimation doping improved the limitations of solution doping. Notably, a high reproducibility was obtained because it does not impedes the solubility of the precursor solution, while maximizing the difference in the work function of the heterojunction by amidine-based organic doping of the back-channel layer.18 Most solution-processed heterojunction oxide TFTs use the spin-coating method; however, several studies using printing have also reported notable advantages, such as local deposition of films, resulting in superior material utilization and inhibited subsequent patterning. In 2015, Lee et al. used inkjet printing to fabricate ZTO/In2O3 heterojunction oxide TFTs with an electron mobility of 8.6 cm2 V1 s\n-1, high on/off ratio of B106, VTH of 2.76 V, and SS of 0.52 V dec-1. They confirmed that inkjet-printed heterojunction structures could reduce the number of trap sites by passivation and surface roughness and improve the film density of the front channel layer.98 In 2019, Liang et al. fabricated In2O3/IGZO heterojunction oxide TFTs with an electron mobility of 14.5 cm2 V1 s\n-1 and high on/off ratio of B106 by inkjet printing. They confirmed that the heterojunction structure is the most important factor for obtaining highperformance TFTs, and a simple ultraviolet (UV)/ozone treatment of the inkjet-printed front channel layer can effectively print the back-channel layer on the patterned area.49 Therefore, this printing process can be used to develop high-performance oxide TFTs with local patterning, thereby significantly changing the conventional concept of electronic device fabrication.\n![11_image_0.png](11_image_0.png)\nSeveral studies have been conducted on heterojunction oxide TFTs using solution-processed high-k dielectrics to develop high-performance devices with a low power consumption and excellent electrical characteristics. Vacuum-processed high-k dielectrics exhibit high stability and low leakage current; however, they require long processing times and high temperatures in the post-deposition treatment. Therefore, inexpensive, simple, and high-throughput solution-processed high-k dielectrics have recently been developed. Rim et al. developed a highperformance heterojunction oxide TFT with a high electron mobility of 40.03 cm2 V1 s\n-1 at a low driving voltage using ZrO2 as a dielectric layer.94 In 2020, Yarali et al. fabricated In2O3/ZnO heterojunction oxide TFTs by spin coating with Al2O3/ZrO2 as a gate dielectric, resulting in an electron mobility of 19 cm2 V1 s\n-1, high on/off ratio of B106, and VTH of 0.5 V.\nThey confirmed that a heterojunction bilayer dielectric reduces the leakage current and surface roughness, and increases the breakdown field, compared to a single-layer dielectric.99 However, solution-processed high-k dielectric layers still has the limitation of high porosity. In 2022, Lee et al. demonstrated the fabrication of In2O3/ZnO heterojunction oxide TFTs with organic–inorganic hybrid dielectric layers by spin coating, achieving an exceptionally high electron mobility of 51.19 cm2 V1 s 1, high on/off ratio of B107, VTH of 0.46 V, and significantly low SS of 0.108 V dec1\n(Fig. 8(e)). The porous morphology of the existing high-k inorganic dielectric layer was significantly improved using a novel crosslinkable ligand, resulting in a dense and defect-free thin-film morphology. Therefore, the leakage current of the device was reduced, while significantly increasing the bias-stress stability.\nThis study demonstrates that the development of a stable dielectric layer using cross-linkable ligands is an effective method for realizing high-performance percolation-limited transport mechanisms in solution-processed heterojunction oxide TFTs.100 Despite these advantages, solution-processed heterojunction oxide TFTs suffer from limitations. If the front channel film is not completely cured due to insufficient curing conditions, it can result in an incomplete metal–oxide–metal\n(M–O–M) structure. Moreover, deposition of the back channel precursor can damage the pre-deposited front channel layer, resulting in an incomplete heterojunction film. To improve these limitations, it is important to form dense thin films using multiple processes such as photoactivation, high-pressure annealing, and plasma-assisted annealing.111 The high-performance solution-processed heterojunction oxide TFTs require high annealing temperature of above 400 1C\nto form an effective M–O–M networks. In low-temperature process of less than 300 1C, a large number of metal–hydroxide bonds exist in the thin film to hinder carrier transport. However, hightemperature annealing causes cracks in flexible substrates due to a mismatch in thermal expansion coefficient, which limits its application to flexible devices. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a device with high electrical characteristics at low-temperature process. To reduce the temperature required for oxidation and impurity removal of solution-processed heterojunction oxide TFTs, various approaches have been investigated, including material-based engineering such as the using of metal alkoxide precursors and carbon-free aqueous solvents, pH control, doping, and combustion synthesis, and process-based engineering such as photoactivation, high-pressure annealing, and plasma-assisted annealing.112 Therefore, solution-processed heterojunction oxide TFTs have been actively studied for several years with the goal of developing low-temperature processes and high-carrier-mobility devices for various application, such as driving backplanes of displays and flexible devices (Fig. 9).\n4. Conclusions And Outlooks\nHeterojunction oxide TFTs overcome the disadvantages of existing single-layer oxide TFTs and exhibit excellent electrical characteristics. This review discusses the charge accumulation, charge-transport mechanisms, and recent research advances in heterojunction oxide TFTs fabricated by vacuum- or solutionbased thin-film deposition.\nGenerally, oxide TFTs exhibit high carrier mobility, negative VTH, high off-current, and low stability, which limit their commercial applications. The oxide surface and chargeaccumulation layer at the heterointerface fabricated by combining two semiconductors with different energy levels further improve the performance of oxide TFT devices, such as significantly high charge mobility and superconductivity, thereby providing the possibility of multifunctional applications.\nVacuum-processed heterojunction oxide TFTs have been reported since 2008. The vacuum process has advantages, such as high stability, high uniformity, and low substrate temperature, resulting in a high electron mobility (4100 cm2 V1 s\nhigh on/off ratio (4108), and high device stability. An encouraging trend in the field of heterojunction oxide TFTs is the change in the fabrication method of heterojunction oxide TFTs from high-vacuum physical processes to simple low-temperature solution processes. Solution-processed heterojunction oxide TFTs have been investigated extensively since 2011. The solution three-dimensional integrated structure, monolithic threedimensional (M3D) integration technology, which integrates layers, such as transistors, diodes, and complementary metal–\noxide semiconductors (CMOS), has been proposed as an alternative. However, this technology has a challenging requirement that the processing environment of the upper device significantly affects the performance of the bottom device.5 In this regard, low temperature processable oxide TFTs can be used as key component of the upper device layer, which can be directly stacked onto the conventional CMOS layer, realizing M3D. Such an M3D approach can open new commercial market of oxide TFTs.\nFinally, to develop high-performance CMOS, further research on P- and N-channel metal–oxide semiconductor is required. The p-type oxide TFT is indispensable for the development of CMOS technology owing to its low energy consumption, simple circuit structure, large noise margin, and simple path to analog and digital circuit designs.109 However, as the p-orbital is highly localized and anisotropic and the hole effective mass is large, p-type oxide TFTs exhibit much lower performance than n-type oxide TFTs.116 Thus, research on heterojunction oxide TFTs has been reported for n-type TFTs, whereas insufficient studies have focused on p-type TFTs. Consequently, research on heterojunction structure strategies is required to develop high-performance p-type oxide TFT that enable the fabrication of high-performance CMOS devices.\nConflicts Of Interest\nThere are no conflicts to declare."
