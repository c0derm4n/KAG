## 5. Fabrication Of Lcd Panel

Table 1 shows the specifications of the display panel with a resolution of 806 ppi. A scan driver is integrated, and the output from an external IC (attached by the chip-on-glass method) is divided by an integrated DeMUX on the source side. Figure 8 shows the picture on the fabricated display, demonstrating the high quality of the image.

## Conclusions

We have fabricated TGSA FETs using OS. We showed that the resistance of the IGZO film is reduced when a high-mobility IGZO film is used as the active layer. This leads to a sufficiently reduced resistance of the source and drain regions and thus an increased on-state current. This allowed us to fabricate a 4K2K
LCD panel with an integrated DeMUX. The top-gate structure enables reduction in parasitic capacitance and improvement in driving capability, so that a panel with a narrow bezel can be obtained.
