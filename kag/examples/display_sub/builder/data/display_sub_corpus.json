This review first provides a brief history **and current status of AOS technology,** and then introduces electronic defects in AOSs reported to date that are critically important for understanding and controlling the instability of TFTs that is the most serious issue in the development of the AOS\ntechnology. In particular, it is important to know that many AOS defects are related to oxygen and hydrogen impurities, though oxygen is the major constituent of AOS and hydrogen is not intentionally incorporated. Instability issues and their underlying mechanisms are also discussed in relation to these defects.\n\n## 1. Introduction: History Of Amorphous Oxide Semiconductors (Aoss) And Why They Are Employed In State-Of-The-Art Displays\n\nAOS is a rather new semiconductor material system for largearea semiconductor devices that came into prominence following hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H), hightemperature annealed polycrystalline silicon (HTPS), laserannealed low-temperature polycrystalline silicon (LTPS), and organic semiconductors. The first practical device made with AOS was reported in 2004 as a channel material of high mobility, transparent, and flexible TFT fabricated at room temperature (RT) on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates without post-deposition annealing.[1] AOS TFT was commercialized in 2012.

Finally, we discuss our understanding of TFT stability issues and propose a fabrication condition for producing good AOS TFTs in relation to the above knowledge of defects. There have been a number of review papers on the subject of AOS TFT. To minimize the references due to page limitation, kindly refer to refs. [2–6] for details and their respective references where details were not provided. Refs. [7–15] are also recommended for further understanding.\n\nRef. [16] is suitable for flexible applications and for solutions and printed electronics.\n\nAOS has a rather short history as its concept was first proposed in 1996.[17] Conversely, research into oxide TFTs dates back to the mid-1960s, starting from crystalline ZnO, In2O3, and SnO2 field-effect transistors (FETs) and TFTs.[18,19] However, after that, few reports about the topic are published in accessible literatures until 1990's probably due to their instability issues.\n\nThe next oxide TFT reappeared in 1996 as a ferroelectric memory FET that uses an epitaxial SnO2 channel.[20] Intensive research on oxide TFT was revisited due to expectations that polycrystalline ZnO (poly-ZnO) would produce practical TFTs even at low temperatures on large glass substrates with much higher fieldeffect (FE) mobilities ((μFE) >10 cm2V1 s 1) than those of a-Si:\nH TFTs (<1 cm2V1 s 1). However, the initial poly-ZnO TFTs suffered from low μFE up to 3 cm2V1 s 1, normally-on characteristics, non-uniformity, and instability issues due to high-density residual electron carriers, grain boundary (GB) issues, etc. (see ref. [2]).\n\nBefore the first AOS was proposed in 1996,[17] it was believed that amorphous semiconductors have very low mobilities <<1 cm2 V1 s 1, as seen in a-Si:H and amorphous chalcogenides. Conversely, the AOS concept proposed indicates that amorphous oxide composed of heavy metal cations (HMC) with electronic configurations (n–1)d10ns 0\n(n  4) are promising candidates for high-mobility amorphous semiconductors because the lowest unoccupied states (conduction band minimum, CBM) is composed mainly of largely spread spherical metal ns0 orbitals and is expected to have a small electron effective mass and a high electron mobility even in amorphous disordered structures. The first demonstrations of AOS were Hþ-implanted Cd2GeO4, AgSbO3, and Cd2PbO4 that showed high electron mobilities for amorphous materials 5–12 cm2 V1 s 1.\n\n[21] Thereafter, high mobility, heavily doped a-IGZO thin films were reported in\n\n## Www.Advancedsciencenews.Com Www.Pss-A.Com\n\n2000.[22,23] Then, a-IGZO was chosen as channel material for TFT because it does not contain toxic elements (such as Cd, Sb, and Pb) and does not require Hþ-implantation to increase its free electron density, Ne. By reducing Ne and defect density in a-IGZO thin films, the first AOS TFT was reported in 2004 with good operating characteristics that can even be fabricated by an RT process on flexible PET sheets.[1]\nAOSs have attracted significant attention in FPD industries and the academia. This is due to its favorable features such as high mobility, high uniformity,low processtemperature, a wideflexibility of chemical composition, good controllability of carrier density, and transparency.[4,11–13,24]Interms ofmobility,μFE>10 cm2V1 s 1 are easily obtained. In addition, higher mobilities >30 cm2V1 s 1 are available for In-rich AOSs and other AOSs such as a-In-Sn-Zn-O\n(ITZO)[25] and a-In-Al-Zn-O (IAZO) TFTs[26] (note that the constituent elements in the IAZO are not described in the paper[27]\nbut presented at the corresponding SID2014 conference). Very high μFE 100 cm2V1 s 1 have been reported for amorphous Zn-O-N\nTFTs[28,29] (note that up to 240 cm2V1 s 1 of Hall mobility was also reported[30]).\n\nFigure 1 compares the typical operating characteristics of an aIGZO TFT and an a-Si:H TFT.[4] It can be seen that the a-Si:H\nTFT provides a source-to-drain current (IDS) up to only 3 μA\neven if high gate-to-source voltage (VGS) and source-to-drain voltage (VDS) of 20 V are applied. However, it is said that a typical organic light-emitting diode (OLED) pixel requires several μA to emit light that is strong enough. In contrast, the a-IGZO TFT provides almost a hundred times higher current than the a-Si:H\nTFT does, and only 5 V of VGS and VDS are required to drive an OLED pixel. This is the most important reason why a-IGZO TFT is considered a necessary semiconductor for state-of-the-art FPDs like large-sized OLED displays.\n\nAfter the first AOS TFT reported in 2004,[1] several manufacturers have demonstrated prototype displays including transparent, flexible, and OLED displays, as summarized in previous review articles.[2,4,5] As at May 2018, only a-IGZO TFTs with nominal chemical composition of InGaZnO4 (so-called 111 composition) have been employed in commercial displays. This is probably because the 111 composition of a-IGZO is the most intensively studied and well understood, and also has a process window wide enough for large-area production of TFT backplanes.\n\nThe first commercialization was achieved by Sharp Corporation in 2012 and then extended to Sharp's mobile phones and tablets, and further extended to many other companies' note PCs, PC displays, etc. As a related material, Sharp and Semiconductor Energy Laboratory (SEL) employ partially crystalized IGZO TFTs for some small-sized high-resolution FPDs but they are not applied to large production lines generation 8.5 (G8.5) as at September 2018. A remarkable commercial a-IGZO TFT product is the large-size OLED\ntelevisions. LG commercialized FHD (resolution 1920  1080) 55 inches curved OLED TV in 2013, 4 K (3840  2160) 65 and 77 curved OLED TV in 2016 and very thin \"wallpaper OLED TV\" in 2017. They also demonstrated more sophisticated prototypes, 8 K\n(7640  4320) 88 inches OLED display and 4 K 65 inches rollable OLED TV at the 2018 International CES. Note that AOS TFT is the only available channel semiconductor for such large-sized OLEDs as at September 2018, because a-Si:H TFTcannot provide Keisuke Ide received B.S. degree\n\n![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)\n\nfrom Meiji University, Japan in 2010, M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo Technology), Japan in 2012 and 2017, respectively.

His research interests include the computerassisted materials design and analyses, materials science, and device physics.\n\nthe required IDS and HTPS/LTPS TFTs can hardly produce such large-sized glass substrates at a reasonable yield and cost.\n\nIn research and prototype devices, AOSs have been examined and applied to many other devices such as flexible devices, transparent displays, high-speed short-channel TFTs, nonvolatile memories, diodes, (TFT-integrated) photosensors, high-voltage external circuits to low-voltage Si ULSI bridging integrated circuits, etc. (see ref. [4]).\n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)\n\nwww.advancedsciencenews.com **www.pss-a.com**\n\n![2_image_1.png](2_image_1.png)\n\n## 2. Origin Of High Mobility In Aoss: Electronic Structure\n\nAs explained in section 1, AOS TFTs exhibit several advantageous features, such as 1) reasonably high mobilities\n(>10 cm2V1 s 1) applicable for large-sized OLEDs; 2) uniformity over large glass substrates; 3) low temperature process from RT to about 400 C; 4) low operating voltages; 5) a small subthreshold voltage swing, S (the S value can be lowered to 100 mV decade1 for a-IGZO TFT that is comparable to the value for poly-Si TFT but much smaller than that for a-Si:H TFT\nwith a value of 400 mV decade1) (see Ref. [4] for details), etc.\n\nTo understand why AOSs can exhibit such high mobilities even in amorphous structures, it is important to compare with conventional covalent semiconductors like Si. Covalent crystalline semiconductors such as c-Si and GaN are used for high-performance, high-value devices such as high-speed memory/CPUs and high-efficiency light-emitting diodes\n(LEDs)/solar cells. Their amorphous materials, such as a-Si:\nH [31,32] and amorphous chalcogenides (e.g., a-Se[33] and aAs2S3\n[34]) are also used in some practical semiconductor devices such as TFTs, solar cells, photoreceptors in photocopiers, phase change (resistivity switching) memories, etc. As known from the success of p/n control in a-Si:H in 1975,[35] it is important to passivate their dangling bonds by forming Si─H bonds to reduce the number of carrier traps so as to employ amorphous silicon for practical TFTs and solar cells. For amorphous chalcogenides, they were used in other applications such as photoreceptors and phase change memories because these applications require neither high mobility nor carrier control. Even a-Si:H exhibits low carrier mobility <1 cm2 V1 s1 because commercial LCDs products and solar cells do not require high mobility but inevitably need low-temperature production on large-sized (e.g., >2  2 m2)\nglasses and plastic substrates. Conversely, ionic crystalline materials have also been intensively investigated for optoelectronic applications based on well-known transparent conductive oxides such as ZnO,[36–38] In2O3,\n[39,40] and SnO2,\n[41] but they have not been commercialized as active semiconductor materials. Though organic semiconductors and their TFTs may be produced at low temperatures and some organic semiconductors exhibit high mobilities >10 cm2 V1 s1, typical materials and TFTs exhibit low mobilities comparable to or even far lower than those of a-Si:H.\n\nAs explained in ref. [2], AOSs overcome their drawbacks because they have unique advantages owing to their ionic bonding nature. As explained above, the mobility of a-Si:H is much lower than that of the crystalline one. This is because their chemical bonds made of sp3 or p orbitals possess strong spatial directivities. Conversely, AOSs exhibit high electron mobilities because the CBMs of HMC oxides are made mainly of spherical s orbitals of metal cations, overlapping largely with neighboring metal s orbitals even in amorphous structures.[42] Other advantageous features of AOSs such as the small S values and low operating voltages are related to their low defect density as explained in refs. [4,5].\n\n## 3. Instability Issues And Effects Of Carrier Traps In Aos Tfts\n\nAs explained in section 2, the major reasons for the large μFE of AOS TFTs are due mainly to 1) high electron mobilities (i.e., Hall mobility or drift mobility) and 2) low-density defects (electron traps). FET physics shows that carrier traps in the gate insulator and gate-channel interface as well as in the channel limit the μFE\nbecause a part of the carriers induced by VGS are immobilized by these traps (e.g., see ref. [4]). This is why specific gate insulator materials should be chosen for specific semiconductor FETs to minimize the total carrier traps; for example, a-SiO2 is usually chosen for crystalline Si FETs and a-SiNx:H for a-Si:H TFTs. In contrast, AOS TFTs exhibit high performances with a wide variety of gate insulators such as SiO2, SiNx,\n[43,44] SiO2/SiNx stacking layer, and high-k materials such as ZrO2,\n[45] Y2O3,\n[46]\nAl2O3,\n[47,48] and organic insulators (though there are some reports that some organic insulators cause extra instability)\nwhose features benefit from the ionic bonding nature that hardly form electron traps.\n\nThough AOS TFTs have many advantages for FPDs and are already commercialized as explained in section 1, they still have open issues, especially the instability issues observed under several stress test modes such as positive bias stability (PBS), negative bias stability (NBS), positive bias and temperature (PBTS), constant current stability (CCS), and negative bias and light illumination (NBIS). Typically, PBS and CCS give positive threshold voltage (Vth) shifts (ΔVth), while light illumination and NBIS induce large negative ΔVth. Conversely, good AOS TFTs do not show reasonable ΔVth against NBS without light illumination. The possible origins of the instability reported to date would be separated to the parts of a TFT structure as follows: 1) gate-insulator[49,50]; 2) interface[51]; 3) surface[52–54];\n4) source/drain contacts[55]; and 5) the bulk region of the channel materials.[4] In terms of defects, in general, the increase in shallow donors in the channel and positive charge trapping at the gate-channel interface cause negative ΔVth while the increase in electron traps (acceptors) in the channel and negative charge traps at the interface cause positive ΔVth.\n\nFigure 2 shows a CCS result for a-IGZO TFTs, where positive ΔVth enhanced the stress time.[56] The creation of deep electron traps and reduction of shallow donors would be possible origins, but the former would be more plausible under such degradation test. In addition, charge trapping/detrapping models have also been proposed.[49,57,58]\n\n![3_image_0.png](3_image_0.png)\n\n![3_image_1.png](3_image_1.png)\n\nwww.advancedsciencenews.com **www.pss-a.com**\nFor the surface issues, it is known that the electrical characteristics of oxide semiconductors including AOS are sensitive to adsorption/desorption of atmosphericmolecules such as O2,H2O, and H2. Kang et al. reported that oxygen adsorbed on an a-IGZO\nsurface causes positive ΔVth as the adsorbed O trap electrons.[52]\nJeong et al. reported that absorbed H2O molecules cause negative ΔVth as electronegative O atoms are adsorbed to the a-IGZO\nsurface.[53,54]Therefore, in practical AOS TFTs, TFTis covered by a gas-tight passivation layer and protected from the adsorption/ desorption/diffusion issues. These gas sensitivities are serious issuesto be solved for TFTs, but they suggest that AOS TFTs can be used for high-sensitivity gas sensors without the need to be protected by passivation layers.[59,60]\nMore serious AOS TFT issues include light illumination instability. In particular, NBISis the most serious issue for TFTs in LCDs because TFTs are always illuminated by LCD backlight and are subjected to negative VGS during for much of their operating time. Though AOSs have large bandgaps, Eg> 3.0 eV (e.g., 3.0–\n3.2 eV for a-IGZO), they exhibit photoresponses even to lower energy subgap light down to 2.3 eV in relation to high-density deep defects in the bandgap (this will be discussed in detail in section 4). **Figure 3** shows transfer curves for unpassivated and Y2O3-passivated a-IGZO TFTs illuminated with monochromated photons fromhν ¼ 1.8–3.4 eVat a photonflux of1014 cm2 s 1. It is seen that off-current Ioff increases and Vth shifts to negative voltages withincreasinghν. Suchlight-inducedinstabilityis closely related to the so-called persistent photo-conductivity (actually not persistent but has very long relaxation time >103 s or even\n>days).[61] **Figure 4** shows that a-IGZO thin films exhibit very long decay times >103 s for transient photocurrents[61] that are often observed in wide gap semiconductors such as ZnO,[62]\nTiO2,\n[63] and GaN.[64] Such slow decay is generally considered to be associated with a relaxation process that possess a large activation energy (see refs. [65,66] e.g., for ZnO), and such phenomena are sometimes employed for optoelectronic devices such as optical sensor-integrated TFT circuits.[67] The paper above[64] proposes bistable structures with activation energies of 0.9–1.0 eV. Nahm et al. supported this idea through density functional theory (DFT) calculations, where the photoexcitation of a valence band electron induces the formation of a peroxy linkage O–O, release electrons, and causes the generation of long decay time photocurrents.[68] A similar model was also proposed for H states.[69]\nAs shown in **Figure 5**a, NBS hardly induces ΔVth in good aIGZO TFTs while large negative ΔVth is observed for NBIS, as shown in Figure 5b. One of the possible mechanisms for the observed instability is described in Ref. [70]. As explained above, a possible origin for negative ΔVth is the accumulation of positive charges at the gate-channel interface. In the case of Figure 5c, the negative ΔVth becomes smaller with increasing\n\n![4_image_0.png](4_image_0.png)\n\nwww.advancedsciencenews.com **www.pss-a.com**\n\n![4_image_1.png](4_image_1.png)\n\nchannel thicknesses for the bottom gate TFT structure with light illumination from the back channel (i.e., from the top of the TFT), suggesting that hole drift/diffusion from the back channel to the interface dominates the instability of the NBIS\nand providing estimation of the hole mobility as 0.01 cm2 V1 s 1. Ion drift/diffusion such as Hþ and ionized oxygen vacancy (e.g., VO\nþ and VO\nþþ) are also other possibilities; however, it is reported that the mobility of O and H estimated from SIMS diffusion studies are as low as 1015 and 1013 cm2 V1 s 1, respectively.[71,72] This implies that the origin of the migrating positive charges is not likely associated with the slow O/H migration, and hole migration and traps may be used to explain the instability of the NBIS in this bottom-gate a-IGZO TFT, as schematically drawn in Figure 5d.\n\n## 4. Electronic Defects In Aoss: Overview\n\nAs described in section 3, instability issues are closely related to carrier traps in gate insulators, interfaces, and channel materials. It is known that some structural defects such as vacancy, substitution, anti-site, and interstitial atoms form carrier traps if they form additional electron states in the bandgap (electronic defects). Conversely, it is often said that\n\"amorphous materials are composed only of structural defects,\"\nbut some amorphous materials have open bandgaps with few carrier traps and work as active layers in semiconductor devices. That is, the important defects for amorphous semiconductors are electronic defects not the structural defects.\n\nThus, we refer to electronic defects as \"defects\" where they are not specifically explained.\n\nFigure 6 summarizes the defects in a-IGZO reported to date\n\n![4_image_2.png](4_image_2.png)\n\nby experimental and theoretical calculations. It is reported that a-IGZO almost has no conduction band (CB) tails[73] and\n\n![5_image_2.png](5_image_2.png)\n\n![5_image_0.png](5_image_0.png)\n\n![5_image_1.png](5_image_1.png)\n\nless subgap density of states than a-Si:H 174.751 that is an important reason that AOS TFTs exhibit high mobility and operate at low voltages, as explained in section 2. Donor levels are located at ≈0.13 eV from CBM (see references in the figure), and deeper traps are found at 0.2–0.3 eV. The number of deep traps at ≈0.2 eV are reduced by annealing at ≥ 300 °C,\nand therefore, post-deposition thermal annealing improves TFT hysteresis and instability. 1751 The deep traps at ≈0.3 eV are passivated through the incorporation of hydrogen, thereby improving a-IGZO TFT performances. In contrast, annealing at ≥ 400°C depletes this hydrogen and deteriorates the performance of the TFT, as will be explained later. [76.77]\nTheoretically, undercoordinated indium is for instance, proposed as an origin of electron traps. [78]\nAn evident feature is that AOS has high-density subgap states just above the valence band maximum (VBM) (near- VBM states) at typical densities > 10 20 cm -3 that is easily detected by hard X-ray photoemission spectroscopy\n(HAXPES) (Figure 7). 1791 Though angle-dependent HAXPES\nanalysis shows that near-VBM states are concentrated at most surface regions in the a-IGZO films fabricated by pulsed laser deposition (PLD), [80] they are nearly uniformly distributed in the bulk region in sputter-deposited a-IGZO films. The near-\nVBM states are distributed in wide energy ranges from VBM to VBM + ≈ 1.5 eV peaking at ≈ 2.5 eV from the CBM, giving the subgap optical absorption and subgap light illumination response with photon energies > 2.3 eV, as explained in Figures 3 and 7. Though the near-VBM spectra look structureless, those originating from oxygen vacancy (Vo), and hydrogen can be deconvoluted, as seen in Figure 8 , providing a fingerprint for judging the origin of near-VBM states (see Ref. [81] ).\n\n![6_image_0.png](6_image_0.png)\n\nwww.advancedsciencenews.com **www.pss-a.com**\n\n![6_image_1.png](6_image_1.png)\n\n## 5. Effects Of Post-Deposition Annealing\n\nPost-deposition thermal annealing is necessarily employed to improve hysteresis and instability issues, especially for commercial a-IGZO TFTs. As seen in **Figure 9**, unannealed TFTs exhibit clock-wise hysteresis, but it is effectively suppressed by annealing at 300–400 C. In particular, wet annealing (20% H2O in O2 gas) produces better TFT than dry O2 annealing possibly due to the high oxidation power experienced in the thermal oxidation process of Si[56] (however, note that although wet annealing produces good static TFT performances, there remains the uncertainty that hydrogen incorporated by wet annealing might cause H-induced instability, as will be discussed later). Hereafter, we will use\n\"high-quality (HQ)\" and \"low-quality (LQ)\" films to simply specify the fabrication conditions of a-IGZO films and TFTs.\n\nHQ is always used for \"optimized\" fabrication condition to exhibit the best TFT performance while LQ is used for \"offoptimized\" conditions where some PLD laser power, sputtering RF power, oxygen partial pressure, annealing temperature/ atmosphere are, for instance, chosen differently from the optimized condition.\n\nIt is an important and remarkable feature of AOS TFTs that good TFT characteristics are easily obtained if annealed at 300–\n400 C in air or O2 even if a pristine TFT is fabricated under the off-optimized condition (low PLD laser power, denoted LQ) and exhibits poor performance, as seen in **Figure 10**.\n\n[7] However, we should recognize that it does not mean that annealed LQ films actually have low defect densities like those fabricated under the optimized condition (HQ). Figure 10 (Left) shows that HQ films possess small subgap optical absorptions in the hν region lower than Eg3.0 eV, but annealed LQ films maintain rather strong subgap absorptions and high-density defects in the bandgap, as seen in Figure 10 (right) though the annealed LQ TFTs exhibit good characteristics similar to HQ TFTs with small subgap optical absorptions and defects. This apparent contradiction is explained by the electronic structure in Figure 6. That is, unannealed LQ films possess very high-densities near-VBM\nstates and offer strong subgap absorptions, while unannealed HQ films possess rather small ones and small subgap absorptions. Annealing reduces the near-VBM states but is not satisfactory in annealed LQ films. However, deep defects such as near-VBM states are inert for static characteristics of nchannel TFTs especially for wide bandgap channels such as AOS.\n\nThis result, in turn, means that we should not judge the quality of AOS channels only from the static TFT characteristics, but we must also optimize the deposition condition so as to minimize the defects and subgap optical absorption in the unannealed states so as to fabricate good and stable TFTs.\n\nFor bulk defects in a-IGZO, it is reported that the number of electron traps at 0.2 eV from CBM are reduced by annealing at 300 C, as explained in Figure 6.[76,82] These results suggest that annealing at 300 C or higher wouldinduce structural relaxationin AOS and generate more stable structures and reduce the number of bulk and surface defects. We will present experimental evidence of the structural relaxation later in section 6. The reduced instability achieved through annealing is also confirmed by stress tests, for example, as seen in the CCS result in Figure 2 that\n\n![7_image_0.png](7_image_0.png)\n\n![7_image_1.png](7_image_1.png)\n\n![7_image_3.png](7_image_3.png)\n\n![7_image_2.png](7_image_2.png)\n\nFigure 9.  A 400°C-annealing effects on hysteresis of a-ICZO TFTs. a) Unannealed, (b) annealed in dry O 2 , and (c) annealed in wet O 2 with 20% H 2 O.\n\n![8_image_1.png](8_image_1.png)\n\n![8_image_0.png](8_image_0.png)\n\nsuggests that the current- induced creation of extra deep traps is suppressed by structural stabilization through annealing. As for the annealing issue related to surface states, SIMS study reveals that the surface of unannealed a-IGZO is reactive while thermal annealing at ≥ 300 ° C weakens the reactivity (in other words, the surface is stabilized by annealing) whose effect is more evident in the case of wet annealing. 172 Several annealing atmospheres have been examined, including atmospheric air, dry O2 gas, wet O2 gas, O3containing O 2 , Ar, N 2 , H 2 , and H plasma. Thermal annealing may have several different results such as 1) induce structural relaxation to form more stable local structures; 2) reduce the number of defects (including point defects and complex defects); 3) remove weakly bonded species; 4) control donor density and conductivity; and 5) generate macroscopic defects\n(grain boundaries and voids). Results 1)–2) can be controlled mainly by the annealing temperature, while the annealing temperature and time would be important for 3) because its process needs the diffusion of O, H, etc., to remove weakly bonded species. For 4), the annealing atmosphere as well as the annealing temperature and time are important. If the a-IGZO\nfilm is deposited in a reducing atmosphere and has high electron density, it should be oxidized, for example, by air, O 2 or wet O 2 (H 2 O) annealing. SIMS analysis reveals that 300 °C is required for enough in-diffusion of O from O 2 gas to obtain 1%\nof oxygen replacement at 15 nm depth from the surface, while H 2 O annealing yields faster in-diffusion (1% replacement is attained at ≈ 15 nm depth at 200°C, ≈ 30 nm at 300°C, and\n>50 nm at 400 C). [72] Actually, it is reported that wet O2 annealing is more effective than dry O 2 annealing to enhance TFT performance, reduce the number of defects, and improve uniformity (Figure 11). [83] However, note that instability issues related to hydrogen appeared in the report in ref. [83] (see ref. [84] for hydrogen instability), and it was also reported that though high-temperature wet annealing at ≥ 300 ° C produces good TFTs, low-temperature wet annealing at < 200°C causes serious negative V th . 1851 Therefore, the employment of wet annealing should be considered in relation to the advantages of the strong oxidation power/the faster diffusion of H 2 O and the disadvantages of H-related instability. O 3 annealing is another way for employing active O atoms to achieve better oxidation at lower temperatures, as O 3 is decomposed to O 2 (molecule) + O\n(atom) at the film surface. In fact, good TFTs are obtained through low-temperature (150 ° C) O 3 annealing. [86]\nH annealing is usually employed for doping electrons because the incorporation of H produces shallow donors in oxide semiconductors, as will be discussed later. Ar or N 2 annealing have also been reported to improve TFT characteristics. Usually, these reducing annealing atmospheres generate oxygen deficiency and shallow donors in oxide semiconductors, while some papers report\n\n![9_image_0.png](9_image_0.png)\n\nwww.advancedsciencenews.com **www.pss-a.com**\n\n![9_image_1.png](9_image_1.png)\n\nthat such reducing annealing atmospheres reduce electron density and improve the properties of the semiconductor and TFT stability. Although its mechanism is not clear yet, some explanations would be possible: 1) remove impurity, H and related shallow donors, and 2) introduce electron traps related to the oxygen vacancy.\n\n## 6. Defect Reduction, Creation, Structural Relaxation, And Crystallization By Annealing\n\nFigure 12 shows the dependences of the annealing temperature for a-IGZO TFT transfer curves and parameters.[77] It is seen that annealing at 200–300 C achieves the best performance with the largest saturation mobility (μsat). According to the spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) result in **Figure 13**, film densification is not detected at 300 C though the TFT performances are improved\n(Figure 12) and the optical bandgap Eg increases in this temperature region.[87] As the optical Eg increase would be due to the reduction of the tail states, the improvement of the TFT up to 300 C annealing would be ascribed to the annihilation of point defects (note these small defects are hard to be detected by usual structural characterizations) and the reduction of tail states.\n\nConversely, annealing at 400 C degrades TFT performance although structural relaxation and densification occur in this temperature range, as seen in Figure 12. It can be understood through the thermal desorption spectra (TDS) in **Figure 14**. The H2O desorption terminates at 400 C, and this threshold temperature corresponds to the starting temperature for TFT\ndegradation in Figure 12. It is further confirmed that rehydrogenation recovers the TFT characteristics (**Figure 15**).\n\nThese results support the idea that some hydrogen passivate electron traps in a-IGZO similar to a-Si:H, whose energy levels are located at 0.3 eV below the CBM and the related hydrogen desorbs at 400 C.\n\nAnnealing at higher temperatures over 600 C causes crystallization, as shown in **Figure 16**.\n\n[87,88] Note that the structural relaxation depends on the as-deposited states. While HQ film (i.e., deposited at the optimum condition and has a high film density)\nshows no detectable relaxation up to 400 C, LQ films (offoptimized conditions and low film density) start to relax from very low temperatures, for example, 100 C, as shown in **Figure 17**.\n\n[87,89,90] Probably related to this structural relaxation behavior, the crystallization onset temperature (TX) for AOS also depends on the deposition condition and structure, as shown in Figure 18. The optimized condition for PLD (PO2¼ 1 Pa) shows TX 600 C, similar to the above sputtering case, while oxygendeficient a-IGZO film exhibits lower TX 500 C. More detailed study on the crystallization of various AOSs is reported in ref. [88].\n\n![10_image_0.png](10_image_0.png)\n\n![10_image_1.png](10_image_1.png)\n\nFigure 12.  Annealing temperature dependences of (a) transfer curves and (b) TFT parameters up to 700 . C. The TFTs were subjected to annealing for\n\n![10_image_2.png](10_image_2.png)\n\nUsually, AOS film growth is conducted on intentionally unheated substrates to obtain amorphous films. We may expect that high-temperature growth would produce stable and low defect density AOS films, but the temperature margin is not large for AOS growth; that is, the growth of IGZO transitions to crystalline growth from ≈ 175 ° C (for instance, it was reported to be 190°C in ref. [91]) that is much lower than Tx by postthrough laser annealing [92] and electron-beam irradiation/\n\n![10_image_3.png](10_image_3.png)\n\n## Ww.Advancedsciencenews.Com\n\nannealing (Figures 19 and 20). [93,94] Ref. [94] reports that some a-\nIGZO films would be crystallized during transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations, and gives rise to a caution that very careful sample preparation and observation conditions\n\n![11_image_1.png](11_image_1.png)\n\nshould be chosen to correctly judge whether the sample is\n\n![11_image_0.png](11_image_0.png)\n\namorphous or crystalline.\n\nFigure 16 also shows that the crystallization of a-IGZO is an inhomogeneous process seeding from the film surface if annealed at low temperatures, for example, at 600 ° C, while homogeneous crystallization from the bulk inside occurs at high-temperature crystallization, for example, at 1000°C. In particular, inhomogeneous crystallization from the top surface produces c-axis oriented crystallites. Sharp employs partially crystallized IGZO in small to medium-sized LCDs called C-axis Aligned Crystalline (CAAC) IGZO in collaboration with SEL. 1951 In fact, some oxides, including ZnO [96] and layered crystals such as InGaZnO 4 , [91] exhibit c-axis preferential growth. SEL reports their crystalline growth conditions in refs. [97,98], where crystalline growth starts from < 200 ° C\nsubstrate temperature, and subsequent annealing, for example, at 450 °C enhances the growth.\n\n## 7. Oxygen-Related Defects 7.1. Oxygen Vacancy/Deficiencies\n\nRecently, first-principles calculations achieved high reliability for materials including heavy metals such as AOSs and provided much information about electronic structures and defect states that have actually been applied to AOSs. [42,99-101]\nFigure 21 shows the pseudo-band structures of a-IGZO with oxygen deficiencies calculated by DFT. [102,103] It is reported that an oxygen deficiency could not only be a deep electron trap but also a shallow donor depending on its local structure. If a large free space remains at a vacancy site, such oxygen vacancy ( Vo )\nforms a deep level in the band gap and traps electrons\n(Figure 21b). This is similar to Vo in crystalline ZnO[104-106]\nand in inorganic electrides such as C12A7:e − [107] Conversely, if such free space is annihilated by a growth condition or thermal annealing process, a shallow donor level is formed, as seen in Figure 21c. The deep states formed with large spaces lie in the deep energy just above VBM and are capable of explaining the near-VBM states observed by HAXPES in Figures 7 and 8. However, this is still of controversy because DFT calculations underestimate bandgap and the calculated defect levels include large ambiguities. Actually, more sophisticated self- interaction correction (SIC) calculations [108] and hybrid DFT calculations[109.110] indicate that the Vo states should lie at shallower energy levels and rather close to the mid-bandgap than the near- VBM states observed by HAXPES. Conversely, the deconvoluted HAXPES for Vo in Figure 8 indicates that the Vo states are close to the VBM, and H- related defects lie around the midbandgap.\n\nThe near-VBM states are observed as subgap optical absorptions, as explained in Figure 7, and subgap optical absorptions typically follows exponential decays down to\n≈ 2.5 eV at an absorption coefficient, α of 10 2 cm − 1 , as shown in the Ro2 = [O2]/([O2] + [Ar]) = 1–10% films in Figure 22a.[11] Here, we like to note that a very different subgap absorption is observed in a-IGZO films deposited without oxygen supply, as seen in Ro2 = 0%. If a-IGZO films is deposited at Ro2 = 0%, strong subgap absorption extending to <0.5 eV appears and the\n\n![12_image_0.png](12_image_0.png)\n\nwww.advancedsciencenews.com **www.pss-a.com**\n\n![12_image_1.png](12_image_1.png)\n\nresultant films exhibit dark colors from brown to black, as seen\n\n![12_image_2.png](12_image_2.png)\n\nin the photograph (Figure 22b). HAXPES is used to directly observe the level of these trap states. The dark color film deposited without O2 supply shows near-VBM states, with an extra shallow band extending to the Fermi level, EF, being consistent with the optical absorption spectrum. This extra state is assigned to segregated In metal (In0), as seen in Figure 22d.\n\nHere, we like to note that the assignment of the near-VBM\nstates is still of controversy as explained above: SIC and hybrid DFT calculations indicate that VO should lie near the midbandgap while the experimental data relate the near-VBM states to oxygen deficient fabrication conditions. In addition, Sallis et al. reported that the density of the near-VBM states has a positive correlation with the oxygen composition and is not consistent with the VO model even though the metal compositions of their a-IGZO films exhibit very large distributions and the near-VBM states might also be affected by variations in the metal composition.[112]\nUsually, electron density and electrical conductivity of oxide semiconductors monotonically increases with decreasing RO2 during film deposition because lower RO2 introduces more oxygen deficiencies and generates more electron donors.\n\nHowever, this is not always true for AOS. **Figure 23**a shows the variation in electrical resistivity as a function of partial oxygen pressure during PLD deposition (PO2). It is seen that the resistivity decreases with decreasing PO2 but suddenly increases at 0.1 Pa. This can be explained by the above DFT result that VO with free space works as an electron trap in AOS (Figure 21b). Actually, the film density decreases at PO2 < 0.1 Pa, as seen in Figure 23c. Such deep VO states are observed by HAXPES as high-density near-VBM states, as seen in the PO2 ¼ 0 Pa data in Figure 23b. This result indicates that an oxygen deficiency condition usually generates free electrons in oxide semiconductors but the formation of lowdensity structures with large free spaces in AOS can produce high-density electron traps and cause serious charge compensations.\n\n## 7.2. Excess/Interstitial/Weakly Bonded Oxygen\n\nThough oxygen is the major constituent of AOS, oxygen sometimes forms an electron trap; for example, a neutral oxygen atom incorporated to a charge neutral AOS framework can capture one or two electrons by O0 þ ne ¼ >On (n ¼ 1 or 2),\nworking as an electron trap. In addition, such oxygen is expected to be \"excess\" in terms of the charge neutral stoichiometry of the AOS framework (this excess oxygen situation can also be\n\n![13_image_0.png](13_image_0.png)\n\n![13_image_1.png](13_image_1.png)\n\nregarded as \"interstitial oxygen\" from the viewpoint of the framework) and also expected to have weaker chemical bonds in the framework. Actually, excess/interstitial/weakly bonded oxygen is experimentally confirmed through TDS and chemical composition analyses. It is reported that O 3 annealing at 30 ° C introduces weakly bonded oxygen that is confirmed by low-temperature (from < 100°C) O 2 desorption in the TDS\nspectrum in Figure 24a. The bistable TFT transfer curves in Figure 24b,c reveals that such weakly bonded oxygen has a negative-U characteristic and takes bistable states that are converted by electron capture with applying positive V GS\n(Figure 24b) and electron release by photoexcitation with photon energies > 2.3 eV (Figure 24c), giving the electronic state model in Figure 25. [113]\nThough such O 3 annealing is not the standard process for display manufacturing, similar weakly bonded oxygen is also observed in standard sputtering deposition; that is, the too high RO2 condition during deposition produces a-IGZO TFTs that exhibit similar bistable behaviors. Figure 26 shows three cyclic measurements of transfer curves for pristine TFTs just after TFT fabrication at RT. It is seen that all the pristine transfer curves for TFTs fabricated with Ro2 = 3–10% give turn-on voltages Von ≈0 V, while the second and third cycle transfer curves give large positive Von that increases from\n≈ 15 to 80 Vas R O2 increases from 3 to 10%. Similar to the case for O 3 annealing at 300 ° C, the large positive Von states are recovered by light illumination with photon energies > 2.3 eV, as shown in Figure 26b. These weakly bonded oxygen behaviors was theoretically explained by the O—O dimer bond model proposed by Han et al. [114]\n\n![13_image_2.png](13_image_2.png)\n\n![14_image_0.png](14_image_0.png)\n\nwww.advancedsciencenews.com **www.pss-a.com**\n\n![14_image_1.png](14_image_1.png)\n\nThe above experimental results do not indicate whether the weakly bonded oxygen is in excess. It was experimentally confirmed through Rutherford backscattering (RBS) measurements, revealing that high total pressure (PTOT) sputtering deposition at 2.0 Pa gives the chemical composition of InGa0.96Zn0.61O4.11, whose oxygen content is 8% excess compared to the total number of atoms in the charge-neutral molecular formula, In3þGa3þ0.96Zn2þ0.61O23.55.\n\n[82]\nCd-Ge-O.[17] This is also the case for a-IGZO.[71] **Figure 27** shows the effect of hydrogen doping through H2 annealing and H plasma treatments, showing that the electron density in a-IGZO is enhanced by H doping up to 1020 cm3 (this value may be the dopinglimit of electrons byHin a-IGZO).This experimental result is also supported by DFT calculation, showing that hydrogen incorporated in stoichiometric a-IGZO forms ─OH bond and ionizes the doped hydrogen to Hþ and generates a free electron, as described in ref. [103]. It should also be noted that hydrogen exhibits not only the Hþ state but also the H state in oxides, as predicted by DFT calculations for ZnO,[118] followed by similar DFT works on H in InGaZnO4.\n\n[119,120] Even though no experimental evidence of H in ZnO and crystalline oxide\n\n## 8. Hydrogen-Related Defects\n\nThe incorporation of hydrogen into oxide semiconductors serves\n\n![14_image_2.png](14_image_2.png)\n\nas electron donors, as experienced in crystalline ZnO[115–117] and a-\n\n![15_image_1.png](15_image_1.png)\n\n![15_image_0.png](15_image_0.png)\n\nsemiconductors has been reported, H  in a-IGZO is experimentally confirmed. [110] implying also that H + (i.e., − OH) in a-IGZO is not so stable and desorbs completely at < T x , while H − at the O 2 − site is stable even in crystallized films.\n\nIn a-IGZO films used for TFTs, hydrogen is not intentionally doped, but actually doped at high densities > 10 20 cm − (ref. [111] reports that 1/3 of H exists as H 7 and 2/3 as —OH in a-IGZO films deposited by conventional sputtering).\n\nThe unintentional hydrogen doping originates from the residual gasses in the growth chamber (note that the base pressures of conventional sputtering chambers are not good, typically Pbase ≈ 10 − 4 Pa that comes mainly from H 2 O and also from H 2 , etc.) and from the supplied gasses such as O 2 and Ar (mainly H 2 O). Use of ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) sputtering chamber (Pbase ~ 10~7 Pa) combined with gas purifiers (to remove H 2 O and H 2 from Ar and O 2 gasses) confirmed that the concentration of H in the resultant a-IGZO films is reduced to the order of 10 19 cm −3 (the measured values reached the detection limit of the SIMS apparatus). [ 121 ]\nHere, we should consider why device-quality a-IGZO films have low electron densities < 10 15 cm − 3 even though they contain high- density impurities of H. As explained in Figure 27, the experimental and theoretical calculation results all indicate that the hydrogen incorporation forms shallow donors, and typical device-quality a-IGZO films deposited by conventional sputtering with Pbase ≈ 10 − 4 Pa include hydrogen at densities > 10 20 cm − 3 that are much higher than the free electron densities < 10 15 cm − 3 . This apparent contradiction can be explained by the charge compensation model; that is, we tune the deposition and post- deposition annealing conditions so as to obtain low free electron density semiconducting films, whose conditions are naturally chosen to incorporate excess oxygen so that most of the free electrons generated from the impurity of H are compensated by the excess oxygen. [71] This model is confirmed by changing Pbase for PLD deposition. [122] Figure 28 shows N c as a function of P O2 for PLD-deposited a-IGZO films.\n\nIt can be clearly seen that the poorer Pbase needs much more oxygen supply to suppress N c . In such a-IGZO films (the H\nconcentration of the poorer P base film is ≈ 10 22 cm − 3 , one order of magnitude higher than that of the good P base film), incorporation of extra H and generation of H-related extra defects was confirmed by TDS, HAXPES near-VBM spectra, and subgap optical absorption similar to the characterizations explained above.\n\n![16_image_2.png](16_image_2.png)\n\n## 9. Macroscopic Structural Defects (Microstructure)\n\nThe total pressure (working pressure) during deposition, PTOT has a significant impact on the microstructure of the film. Usually, it is difficult to characterize the structure of amorphous films, but the film density can be obtained through X-ray reflectivity spectroscopy (XRR) analysis. In addition, high-angle-annular-dark-field mode of scanning transmission microscopy (HAADF-STEM) can provide a high-sensitivity technique for observing microstructures in AOSs because its contrast is proportional to the square of the atomic number, Z 2 and sensitive to the electron density. As seen in\n\n![16_image_1.png](16_image_1.png)\n\n![16_image_0.png](16_image_0.png)\n\nFigure 29, [89] the optimum P TOT = 0.55 Pa provides a high density of 6.1 g cm − 3 (≈ 5% lower than that of crystalline InGaZnO 4 [891 )\nwhile a high P TOT = 5.0 Pa yields a much lower density of 5.5 g cm − 3 in the as-deposited states up to 500 ° C annealing. The increase in the density at > 500–600 ° C is attributed to crystallization, as explained above. One important feature of the high P TOT\n\n![17_image_1.png](17_image_1.png)\n\n![17_image_0.png](17_image_0.png)\n\nfilms is that they include high-density weakly bonded species. As the chemical compositions of P TOT = 0.55 and 5.0 films are InGa 0.9 Zn 0.6 O 3.45 and InGa 0.84 Zn 0.81 O 3.57 (the metal compositions were measured by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF), and the oxygen compositions were estimated through the ion charge neutrality condition), the above density difference ≈ 10%\ncannot be explained by the average atomic mass that corresponds to the ion packing density. Figure 29b shows the total amounts of desorbed molecules integrated up to 600 ° C in TDS spectra, showing that the optimum PTOT = 0.55 Pa exhibits the minimum desorption amount while P TOT ≥ 2.0 Pa exhibits much larger amounts of H 2 O, O 2 , H 2 , and Ar desorption (these were detected by TDS. Ar can also be detected by PES and RBS [82] ). These desorptions start from ≈ 80°C, implying that the high PTOT films incorporate much weakly bonded O and H. The TFT transfer curves in Figure 29c,d show that the high P TOT = 5.0 Pa TFT\nexhibits poor performance with very high V on and low on current\n( Ion ), similar to TFTs incorporating weakly bonded O, as explained above. However, if the high PTOT TFTs were annealed, for example, at 300°C, the resultant transfer curve becomes similar to those of the optimum P TOT = 0.55 Pa TFTs. Such behavior (i.e., thermal annealing at ≥ 300 ° C produces apparently good TFTs even if the a-\nIGZO channel is deposited at an off-optimized condition and the unannealed TFT exhibits poor performance) is a remarkable characteristic of AOS TFTs, as discussed in section 5. Also explained in section 5, this does not mean that thermal annealing can produce high-quality, low-defect density AOS films, and TFTs.\n\nActually, Figure 10 shows that the annealed LQ TFTs still have much larger densities of subgap states compared to those of HQ even though annealed LQ TFTs exhibited good performances similar to unannealed and annealed HQ TFTs.\n\nSuch a difference was also observed by the HAADF- STEM\nimages in Figure 30. The 5.0 Pa film has a porous columnar structure while the optimum 0.55 Pa film has much uniform structure although a slight evolution of the columnar structure can be detected near the surface region. Here, we like to note that the effect of film density on TFT characteristics and defect density in a-IGZO TFT was first noted by Jeong et al., who reported that lower pressure deposition achieves fewer defects. [123] Figure 31 shows the evolution of the HAADF-STEM\nimages for high-density (HQ) and low-density (LQ) a-IGZO\nfilms. As noted above, low-density films have columnar structures like vertical voids in the unannealed state, while the vertical voids are converted to closed voids along with a reduction in the thickness upon thermal annealing. It was reported in the sintering process for ceramics that such closed pores are hardly removed by subsequent sintering processes if molecules such as O 2 and H 2 O are included. This result also indicates that annealed low-density a-IGZO would contain several closed void structures, far different from the high- density a-IGZO even if those TFTs exhibit similar good characteristics.\n\nThese extra defects in off-optimized a-IGZO films would cause extra instability issues even if the annealed TFTs exhibit good static characteristics similar to HQ TFTs. This implies that\n\n![18_image_1.png](18_image_1.png)\n\nthe film deposition condition must be finely tuned so that good TFT performances are obtained without thermal annealing.\n\nIt should also be noted that even in high-density films, the growth mode changes at ≈ 20 nm (threshold thickness) with a\n\n![18_image_2.png](18_image_2.png)\n\n![18_image_0.png](18_image_0.png)\n\nstructural change from a dense uniform structure to a slightly columnar structure, as shown in Figure 30a that is more evident in the low-density film in Figure 30b. Usually, the channel thicknesses of a-IGZO TFTs are less than 80 nm, probably because the electrical conductivity of a-IGZO films significantly increases and TFT exhibits negative V th when the channel thickness exceeds 100 nm that would be related to this kind of growth mode/microstructure change. The reduction of H impurity through UHV sputtering increases the threshold thickness at least up to 100 nm.\n\n## 10. Possible Reactions And Mechanisms Of Various Instability Modes\n\nHere, we try to summarize the current knowledge of defects in AOSs to understand the possible mechanisms of various instability issues.\n\n![19_image_0.png](19_image_0.png)\n\n![19_image_1.png](19_image_1.png)\n\n## 10.1. Temperature Instability\n\nAOS often shows large temperature instability in electrical properties, especially if it is deposited at the off-optimized condition and not subjected to thermal annealing. Ref. [83] reports that the conductivity of unannealed a-IGZO films that initially have rather low conductivities σ < 10 − 3 S cm − 1 increase largely up to ≈ 10 3 S cm − 1 as the annealing temperature increases from RT to 300°C even under dry and wet O 2 atmospheres (Figure 32). The σ starts to decrease from 30°C and finally recovers to low values ≈ 10 3 S cm\n(corresponding to ANc ~1020cm~3 upon supposition of mobility) if kept at 400°C for 1 h. This 10 cm 2 V − 1 s − 1 phenomenon is more clearly seen in the time variation of σ during temperature raising and maintaining period, as shown in Figure 33 . The first increase in σ during annealing up to 30 ° C would be ascribed to several possible mechanisms: 1)\nincrease in shallow donors; 2) decrease in electron traps; 3) desorption of oxygen and generation of oxygen deficiency, 4) incorporation of atmospheric molecules like H 2 O, etc. In the\n\n![19_image_2.png](19_image_2.png)\n\n![20_image_0.png](20_image_0.png)\n\nphysica www.advancedsciencenews.com **www.pss-a.com**\n\n![20_image_1.png](20_image_1.png)\n\ncase of ref. [83], 1.7  1019 cm3 of H2O desorption was observed\n\n![20_image_2.png](20_image_2.png) while those of H2 (4.7  1017) and O2 (1.7  1017) were much lower than those for the H2O desorption. Therefore, the H2O desorption is the most plausible reason for the increase in σ. Even though the increase in Ne can be explained by some reactions such as MOH þ MOH ¼ >VO\n2þ þ MOM þ H2O\" þ 2e\n, the amount of H2O desorption is still far less than ΔNe. Therefore, we should also consider the reduction of electron traps. As seen in previous sections, AOS can incorporate many different electron traps such as weakly bonded O (note that this is located at similar energy levels to near-VBM states upon electrons capture) and VO. In particular, weakly bonded species start to desorb from very low temperatures such as 80 C.[113]\nNear-VBM states assignable to VO also starts to decrease from low temperatures and up to 300 C.[124] The desorption/\nannihilation of these electron traps releases free electrons to the conduction band. In particular, the densities of the near-VBM\nstates are >>1020 cm3 and its annihilation by annealing can quantitatively explain the large ΔNe. Conversely, the case of Figure 33a corresponds to ΔNe 1016 cm3 while other mechanisms including the desorption of charged weakly bonded species and H2/H2O desorption (e.g., by 2H ¼> H2\" þ 2e\n.\n\n![21_image_0.png](21_image_0.png)\n\n![21_image_1.png](21_image_1.png)\n\n## 10.2. Positive Gate Bias And Current Instability\n\nUsually or in several cases, the stress conditions cause positive ∆ V th . The possible mechanisms responsible for this are: 1)\nnegative charge trap in the gate insulator/interface; 2) creation of electron traps in the channel; 3) reduction of shallow donors in the channel, etc. Ref. [56] noted that the reduction of donors was not possible and mainly ascribed this to the creation of electron traps (case 1 is excluded because that study employed thermally oxidized SiO 2 on Si wafer as a gate insulator). Other reports also examined charge trapping issues in gate insulators.[44,49,126,127]\nUraoka et al. reported that Joule heating is also important for inducing instability, especially for highly resistive/low mobility AOS TFTs. In other words, high-mobility AOS TFTs such as In-\nSn-Zn-O (ITZO) are more robust for PBS and CCS. [55,128]\nTable 1. Typical RF sputtering parameters for obtaining good TFT\ncharacteristics with our apparatus (Canon Anelva, Japan, E-200S-TK).\n\n![22_image_2.png](22_image_2.png)\n\n## 10.3. Negative Gate Bias Instability\n\nGood AOS TFTs usually do not show NBS instability, as seen in Figure 5a, suggesting that the creation of extra defects and/or structural changes would not be induced if high electrical current is not provided. Negative AV th can explained by the opposite processes to those for the above positive AV th cases.\n\nThat is, 1) trap of positive charges in the gate insulator/interface;\n\n![22_image_3.png](22_image_3.png)\n\n![22_image_1.png](22_image_1.png)\n\n![22_image_0.png](22_image_0.png)\n\nacceptors in the channel, etc. These will be discussed in detail in the next section.\n\n## 10.4. Light Illumination Instability\n\nLight illumination instability is serious for AOS TFTs even against subgap photons, as explained above. In particular, NBIS causes an increase in I off and a large negative ∆ V th . It is closely related to the slow photo-response of AOS in Figure 4.161] The bistable states of weakly bonded oxygen and its recovery in V th by light illumination (Figures 24–26) is also one type of light illumination instability. [113] However, its microscopic mechanism may have several possible models and is still controversial.\n\nNomura et al. proposed that the migration of holes generated by light illumination and their trap at the interface is a consistent mechanism if the hole mobility is as large as 0.01 cm 2 V − 1 s −\nRyu et al. and several other researcher noted that positively charged Vo may be the origin of trapped positive charges, [129] but it would be hard to expect that Vo diffusion (this is actually the same as O diffusion) has a high enough diffusion constant as the diffusion constant of O, reported to be 1015 cm2 s 1 by SIMS in ref. [72]. There are some mechanisms that do not require longdistance diffusion. Nahm et al. noted that the excitation of valence band electrons (i.e., on O2) form metastable O─O bond\n(peroxy linkage) and release free electrons by O2 þ O2 ¼\n>O2 2 þ 2e\n.\n\n[68] Similarly, Han et al. observed that interstitial oxygen forms O─O dimer bond upon electron capture to account for the experimental weakly bonded oxygen,[113] and also account for light illumination/negative bias instability by the opposite process, as these conditions release electrons.[114] Kang et al.\n\nreported a model of bistable hydrogen; that is, the conversion of H to Hþ can cause persistent photocurrent and negative ΔVth in photo-bias-thermal instability.[69]\n\n## 11. What Determines Optimum A-Igzo Deposition Condition?\n\nSo far, we have seen that it is important to form a densely packed structure to reduce the number of void-related electron traps so as to finely control the oxygen content to minimize weakly bonded/excess oxygen, and to reduce the amount of hydrogen impurity (but not too much) so as to produce good and stable a-IGZO TFTs. Even though thermal annealing at 300 C produces apparently good TFTs, several defects still remain if the a-IGZO channel is deposited at the off-optimized condition; that is, the AOS channel deposition condition should be optimized so as to obtain good TFT performances without annealing. Here, we will discuss how to control the deposition condition to obtain such films.\n\nHere, we explain the deposition methods. PLD was first used for making a-IGZO films and TFTs[1] because it can easily control the chemical compositions of complex oxides such as IGZO. The growth of AOS growth can be achieved by a variety of film growth methods, including DC/AC/RF sputtering, sol-gel solution process, etc. For mass production, especially for flat panel displays, DC/AC sputtering are preferred because of the large fabrication area and compatibility with present display technology. Thus, hereafter, we focus on the optimum condition for sputtering.\n\nTable 1 summarizes the typical optimum deposition conditions for our RF magnetron sputtering system. It is well known that in oxide conductors such as indium tin oxide (ITO),\nthe carrier concentration can be modified by changing PO2 (in other words, RO2). Similarly, the conductivity of a-IGZO films is mainly controlled by RO2, as shown in **Figure 34**a. Comparing the corresponding TFT transfer curves in Figure 34b, the condition for obtaining good TFT is empirically chosen to as carrier concentrations of 1012–1015 cm3 or conductivities (σ) of 106–103 S cm1. Note that the optimum RO2 value would be different, depending on the apparatuses used for the deposition or other deposition parameters. In particular, Pbase and the residual H in the deposition chamber cause critical differences in the optimum RO2 to obtain the above optimum σ, as explained in Figure 28. For other deposition parameters, higher sputtering power and smaller target-substrate (TS) distances generally produces better TFTs (**Figure 35**). As shown in Figure 29–31, a lower PTOT is also better. These conditions would be the opposite of the conditions for crystalline semiconductors and devices because these AOS conditions produce higher energy deposition precursors and yield more serious ion bombardment damages\n(e.g., by breaking metal cation-oxygen bonds[130]) to the growing films. However, AOS films are usually deposited at room temperature or rather low temperatures, and deposition precursors attached to the growth surface cannot have enough thermal energy to migrate and to form relaxed stable structures. Therefore, high kinetic energy should be provided to the deposition precursors via the sputtering process. The extra defects created by high-energy ion bombardment are reduced in number by subsequent annealing. Higher sputtering powers produces higher-energy precursors, while smaller TS distances and lower PTOT reduces the number of collisions between the precursors and the gaseous molecules/atoms in the plasma to retain the kinetic energy of the precursors, leading to more efficient surface relaxation in the vicinity of the growing surface and to reduced number of defects. These conditions also lead to higher deposition rates and suppress the incorporation of impurity species such as H2O and excess O2 from the deposition atmosphere. This trend is more clearly observed in amorphous Ga-O (a-GO),[131] where semiconducting a-GO films are obtained only when the film density is increased to >5.2 g cm3 by\n\n![23_image_0.png](23_image_0.png)\n\nwww.advancedsciencenews.com **www.pss-a.com**\n\n![23_image_1.png](23_image_1.png)\n\nwww.advancedsciencenews.com **www.pss-a.com**\n\n![24_image_1.png](24_image_1.png)\n\n![24_image_2.png](24_image_2.png)\n\n![24_image_0.png](24_image_0.png)\n\nincreasing the growth rate >15 nm min1, which are achieved through high power PLD deposition (**Figure 36**). As discussed above, fine control of PO2 is also critical in reducing electron traps and for producing conductive a-GO films; that is, too small PO2 produces deep electron traps (near-VBM states) while too high PO2 incorporates weakly bonded O & H2O and forms lowdensity structures with free spaces to generate electron traps as well. To reduce the amount of H impurity, the use of gas purifier and employing high growth rate deposition are helpful during manufacturing (note that UHV sputtering can also reduce the amount of H impurity but is not easily available for manufacturing).\n\nFigure 37 shows a typical fabrication process for a-IGZO TFT\nwith an etching stopper layer (ESL) that is similar to the inverted staggered a-Si:H TFTs. Typical gate insulators and ESLs consist of SiO2 and/or SiNx:H deposited by plasma chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or sputtering. Note that deposition conditions should also be determined in consideration of H-incorporation. For the bottom gate insulator, the H issue is less serious because its deposition process employs high-temperature deposition, for example, 350 C to reduce the amount of residual H. Conversely, the top ESL layer should be carefully formed by controlling the temperature and residual H.[132] At high-temperature deposition, hydrogen diffuses from the plasma to the a-IGZO layer during the deposition and causes serious negative ΔVth, even if\n\n![24_image_3.png](24_image_3.png)\n\nthe residual H in the ESL layer is low. While at low-temperature deposition, high-density H contained in the ESL layer causes instability issues. Therefore, the deposition and post-deposition annealing temperatures should be finely tuned, for example, between 175 and 250 C.\n\nThere are several methods for depositing AOS films reported to date, including sputtering, mist-CVD, MOCVD, and solution process. Currently, sputtering is the only deposition method employed for the mass production of aIGZO TFT backplanes. As explained in ref. [4], polyInGaZnO4 rotatory target and monolithic planer target are supplied by several companies. As shown in **Figure 38**, the color of the target InGaZnO4 target is a simple and good indicator of the carrier density and conductivity. As crystalline InGaZnO4 is a transparent oxide semiconductor with a bandgap of 3.7 eV, the color of a stoichiometric target should be white as seen in Figure 38a. Conversely, InGaZnO4 is reduced by higher temperature sintering and/or sintering in reducing atmospheres such as in N2, and turns gray and finally black (Figure 38b). For PLD and RF/AC sputtering, the targets can be insulated. Conversely, many commercial processes employ DC magnetron sputtering, for example, to increase the deposition rate and reduce the tact time, but it\n\n![25_image_0.png](25_image_0.png)\n\nwww.advancedsciencenews.com **www.pss-a.com**\n\n![25_image_1.png](25_image_1.png)\n\nSome of the new functional AOS materials were recently found. Amorphous GaO was reported as an ultra-wide bandgap semiconductor that can be used for novel phosphor materials.[133–136] Amorphous Zn-Si-O and amorphous Ca-Al-O were developed for electron transport layers and electron injection layers for top-emission inverted OLED.[137–139] Amorphous p-type Cu-Sn-I semiconductor offers high mobility p-type semiconductors fabricated at RT by solution processes, though it is not an oxide.[140]\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThe authors acknowledged Drs.

The insufficient oxygen supply from the targets is compensated for by the O2 gas supply during sputtering deposition to produce highly resistive, high-quality, stoichiometric a-IGZO films. However, there remains an open question about the effect of the off-stoichiometry of the sputtering target on the instability of AOS TFTs.\n\n## 12. Conclusion\n\nWe reviewed the defects in AOSs and discussed the origins of TFT instabilities and their optimum fabrication conditions.\n\nSeveral defects have been clarified in the past 10 years, but their microscopic origins are not satisfactorily clear, and the instability issues were not satisfactorily solved although several commercial FPDs employ IGZO TFTs. Deeper investigation of the origins of the defects and production methods for controlling them along with stable high-mobility AOS materials will be inevitable especially for near-future applications such as very high-resolution, high-speed and large displays like >8 K\n88 inch OLED, really flexible/foldable displays, transparent displays, and CPU/memory integrated displays and circuits.\n\n[1] K.

Introduction\n\nA MORPHOUS indium-gallium-zinc-oxide (a-IGZO)\nthin-film transistors (TFTs) are of increasing interest for active-matrix displays due to their high field-effect mobility cm V s and low threshold voltages V\n[1]. In addition, low temperature processing at 200 C\nmakes a-IGZO devices compatible with flexible substrates and potentially enabling them to be exploited in flexible transparent displays [2]. A bottom-gate a-IGZO TFT with an etch stopper structure is widely used for display applications, but it has a high parasitic capacitance ( ) because of the overlap between the gate and source/drain electrodes. The overlap is required as a misalignment margin for the photolithographic processes used to define the shapes of the gate, source/drain, and etch-stopper. This is proportional to the overlap area, and results in kickback/feed-through voltage, which induces signal RC delay in TFT arrays [3]. The channel length ( )\nof TFTs is typically 2–5 m for applications to active-matrix liquid crystal display (AMLCD) and active-matrix organic light-emitting diode (AMOLED) displays. To have a high-resolution display with integrated TFT driver circuits, should Manuscript received March 09, 2013; revised June 12, 2013; accepted June 28, 2013.

Therefore the effect of varying on device reliability, especially stability, needs to be understood. stability is required for long lifetime in active matrix displays [6], [7]. Therefore, many recent articles related with a-IGZO TFT stability have been focused on reducing the shift ( ) [8]–[11].\n\nIn this work, we report the dependency of the electrical stability of a-IGZO TFTs with a self-aligned coplanar structure\n[5]. The short- TFT is found to have less compared to long- TFT. The time dependence of the under PBS is fitted to a stretched-exponential formula. An a-IGZO TFT with m exhibits a much longer time constant compared to a TFT with m.\n\n## Ii. Device Fabrication\n\nFig. 1 shows the (a) schematic cross-sectional and (b)\nscanning electron microscope (SEM) image of a self-aligned coplanar a-IGZO TFT. The detailed fabrication process is described elsewhere [5], [12]. On a 200-nm-thick oxide buffer layer on glass, a 20-nm-thick a-IGZO was deposited by direct current (DC) sputtering using a polycrystalline IGZO target (In O Ga O ZnO ) at 200 C. A 200-nm-thick SiO layer was deposited at 170 C by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) as a gate insulator and a protection layer of the oxide semiconductor. Not that the buffer layer, active layer and gate insulator are deposited consecutively without breaking vacuum. After Mo patterning for gate electrodes, the SiO gate insulator was then etched using a self-aligned process and then the a-IGZO layer was patterned by a wet etch process. Then, a 200-nm-thick SiN layer was deposited as an interlayer by PECVD and via-holes were formed. After deposition of the SiN layer, the source and drain regions of the a-IGZO semiconductor are doped n .\n\n![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)\n\nAs described in detail in [5] and [7], SiN x contains a lot of hydrogen, which can diffuse into the a-IGZO. Sato et al. [12] and Ahn et al. [13] reported that hydrogen acts as donor in a-IGZO. This will effectively make the source and drain regions n + . Note that the channel region is protected by the SiO 2 gate-insulator and Mo gate metal from any contact with SiN n and therefore remains intrinsic. Finally, a 200-nm-thick Mo layer was deposited and patterned as source/drain electrodes. The TFT I-V characteristics were measured at room temperature, using the Agilent 4156C precision semiconductor parameter analyzer.\n\n## Ii. R Esults And D Iscussion\n\nIn order to investigate the L dependency of ∆ V th under bias stress, we carried out the gate bias stress experiments on the self-aligned a-IGZO TFTs with various L . Fig. 2 shows the evolution of transfer characteristics and field-effect mobility ( l fc ) under PBS ( V G_STRESS = +20 V, for 10 000 s) for the TFTs with L of (a) 10 µ m and (b) 2 µ m. Fig. 2(c) is the histogram of the | ∆ V th | for 31 TFTs with L = 2 µ m after applying PBS\nfor 1000 s. The source and drain electrodes were connected to ground during gate bias stress and the channel widths of all TFT's were 20 µ m. The V th of the oxide TFTs shifts to the positive direction under PBS [7]. The | ∆ V th | of the device with L = 10 µ m is 4.1 V after applying PBS for 10 000 s. The µ fe ,\nwhich is derived from the transconductance gm, also shifts in a similar fashion [Fig. 2(a)]. An obvious difference is that a peak value in µ fe exists for short channel devices, whereas in long channel devices the µ fo continues to increase with increasing V GS , within the measured range of V GS . As there are more carriers in the channel of the former compared to that of the latter, it is reasonable to attribute the decrease in mobility of the former to carrier scattering at higher VGS values.\n\nOn the other hand, the | ∀ V th | for the device with L = 2 µ m is only 0.3 V after PBS for the same stress time [Fig. 2(b)].\n\nFig. 2(c) summarizes the | ∀ V th | of 31 TFTs with L = 2 µ m after applying PBS for 10 000 s. These 31 TFT's were located\n\n![1_image_1.png](1_image_1.png)\n\n| Channel length ( μ m)   | τ (sec)   | β value   |\n|-------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| 40                      | 2.50 x 10 | 0.323     |\n| 20                      | 4.87 x 10 | 0.343     |\n| 10                      | 3.81 x 10 | 0.330     |\n| 000                     | 1.38 x 10 | 0.339     |\n| 1166                    | 1.87 x 10 | 0.347     |\n| 0.398                   |           |           |\n| 4                       | 3.53 x 10 | 0.530     |\n| 9.38 x 10               |           |           |\n\nat various positions across a 6\"× 6\" glass substrate. Almost all of the TFTs undergo | ∆ V th | < 1 V, verifying good reliability and uniformity of these short channel devices. The instability of L dependence is clearly seen in PBS and these results cannot be explained only by a charge trapping model [14], [15]. In contrast, negative bias stress (NBS) and negative bias illumination stress (NBIS) for the a-IGZO TFTs with various L were measured and the results indicate they are independent of L .\n\nTo investigate the L dependence of threshold voltage instability, we measured the instabilities of the TFTs with various L under PBS. Fig. 3(a) shows the time dependence of | ∆ V t h | as a function of L . The L is varied between 2 and 40 µ m. Note that instability increases with increasing L but saturates at L ≥ 10 µ m. Fig. 3(b) shows that the measured time-dependence of | ∀ V th | is well fitted by the stretched-exponential equation,\n\n$$\\Delta V_{\\rm th}|=V_{\\rm O}\\left\\{1-\\exp\\left[-\\left(\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right)^{\\beta}\\right]\\right\\}\\tag{1}$$\n\nwhere V O , T and β are saturation value of | ∆ V th | , characteristic time of carrier trapping, and stretched exponential parameter, respectively [16]. The | ∆ V eh | by PBS decreases with decreasing L . A good fit is achieved when τ is 9.38 × 10 6 and 3.81 × 10 5 s, respectively for L of 2 and 10 µ m. Table I summarizes τ and β values extracted for varying L .\n\nWe measured the resistance of the intrinsic a-IGZO (channel region) and that of the n + a-IGZO (source and drain a-IGZO regions), using resistance measurement test structure, consisting of strips of a-IGZO covered by SiO 2 and SiN x , respectively.\n\nThe measured resistivity ( ) was 1.05 10 cm for n a-IGZO region and 1.20 10 cm for the intrinsic region. Therefore, the resistivity of the channel region is much higher than that of the n a-IGZO source and drain regions by about 3 orders of magnitude. The carrier concentration can be estimated from the sheet resistivity measurements for the channel and n source and drain region of the a-IGZO films by assuming the mobility of 15 cm V s which was obtained from the performance of the a-IGZO TFTs. The carrier density was found to be 3.5 10 cm and 4.0 10 cm in the channel and n a-IGZO regions, respectively. This is due to high concentrations of H in SiN , which results in the diffusion of from the top SiN interlayer to the a-IGZO region, making it n .\n\nNote that H diffusion from the SiO gate insulator is insignificant because the content in SiO is negligible. It is therefore worth noting that short channel devices exhibit a more negative initial compared to long channel devices. This difference can be explained by carrier diffusion from the n doped source/drain regions to the intrinsic channel region, and thereby shifting the Fermi level ( ) towards the conduction band minimum ( ). This unintentional doping is mainly confined to the channel edges. As a result, the effect is dominant in short channel devices (hence, the negative ) and becomes less and less effective as increases. The detailed explanation of dependence on is presented in [7].\n\nWe therefore propose a model to explain the stability dependence on as shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b). The carrier concentration is different between the channel and n a-IGZO regions in oxide TFTs. This difference makes carrier diffusion gradient into the channel from the edges of the channel. This diffusion of carriers increases the carrier concentration of the channel edges as shown in Fig. 4(a). Because of the diffusion gradient, the effect is therefore very significant in short channel devices, and less significant in longer channel devices. Since the carrier concentration in the channel of oxide TFTs corresponds to the Fermi level ( ) [16], the of shorter channel devices is closer to the conduction band ( ) compared to that of longer channel devices. The extracted of self-aligned coplanar a-IGZO TFTs is 0.109 eV and 0.193 eV for m and 20 m, respectively, by - and - measurements [7]. Therefore, assuming the same number of trap states in short and long channel devices, there are less unoccupied states at/near the semiconductor/gate–insulator interface in short channel devices than there are in long channel devices [Fig. 4(b)]. As a result, there is less electron trapping in short channel devices compared to long channel devices under PBS. This is consistent with the fact that the stability of TFTs with m is similar, but can be improved significantly for m. The big difference with Si device physics is due to the much higher mobility and carrier lifetime ( ) product in a-IGZO as compared to a-Si or nc-Si [18] and the fact that Si is doped by substitutional ion doping, whereas a-IGZO is doped by varying the oxygen (or hydrogen) content. Since the PBS instability of the devices presented herein depends on the position of , it is reasonable to attribute the induced by the PBS to carrier trapping into traps located inside the a-IGZO region near the a-IGZO/gate-insulator interface. Under PBS, with grounded source and drain electrodes, a uniform potential is kept across the channel, which causes\n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)\n\nthe drift of electrons towards the a-IGZO/gate-insulator interface at high energies. If the number of un-occupied trap states is large at the interface, as in the case of long channel devices, the occupational probability is also large, hence a large number of electrons may become trapped into these trap states. Note that a higher corresponds to a smaller number of unoccupied trap states [Fig. 4(b)]. When the - characteristics are measured after PBS, the trapped charge impose a positive-bias-effect in which they screen the applied electric field, thereby reducing the effective applied gate voltage - hence the positive .\n\nConsequently, a device with a high (short-channel device),\nwill exhibit negligible after PBS [Fig. 2(b)]. Therefore, the shift by PBS in coplanar a-IGZO TFTs can be reduced by decreasing .\n\n## Iv. Conclusion\n\nIn summary, we have studied the effect of channel length on electrical stability of a-IGZO TFT with a self-aligned coplanar structure. For short-channel devices ( m), the is much less as compared to long channel devices. We propose the mechanism of channel length dependence of PBS that is based on the shift of the Fermi level towards the conduction band edge with decreasing channel length. The shift of is caused by carrier diffusion from the n doped source and drain regions to the intrinsic channel region. These results indicate that stability against PBS can be improved by raising . If is raised, the number of un-occupied trap states decreases, resulting in less electron trapping under PBS - hence less .\n\n[2] M. Mativenga, M. H. Choi, D. H. Kang, and J.

A slight horizontal streaks issue observed on RG/GB/RB mixed color image under middle and low grayscale display is analyzed and discussed. The modeling and simulation results indicate that the issue is related to the drive architecture of Zigzag-column inversion under charging insufficient of source lines.\n\nAuthor Keywords IGZO; DEMUX; BCE; Narrow bezel; Notebook LCD\n\n Introduction In recent years, \"full screen\" and \"narrow bezel\" has been a new direction of development and competition in the field of notebook LCDs. De-multiplex (DEMUX) technology applied to LCDs can reduce the number of ICs used and narrow the bezel, by decomposing one single signal into multiple channel signals using multiple TFTs to control [1]. Currently, low temperature polysilicon (LTPS) DEMUX technology is being applied in smartphones and notebook LCDs in the market to realize a full screen visuals and narrow bezel [2]. However, the disadvantage of LTPS is evident that high cost in process and high leakage current in property [3]. which are hindering its extensive development.\n\nIGZO semiconductor own high mobility, maximum switching ratio, minimum leakage current and lower process cost [4]. Therefore, we develop an IGZO DEMUX technology and make the 13.3 inches FHD (1920 × 1080) DEMUX LCDs successfully. A back-channel etching (BCE) process are used to save the cost. A DEMUX 1:3 technology is adopted to reduce the source ICs on panel from 4 to 1. Combing with TconEmbedded Driver (TED) technology, the module bottom border of the LCD is implemented to less than 15mm. Table 1 shows the comparison of normal design and IGZO TED DEMUX 1:3 LCDs.\n\nTable 1. The comparison of normal design and TED\n\n![0_image_1.png](0_image_1.png)\n\nDEMUX 1:3 Normal Design TED DEMUX 1:3 A Study on De-multiplex Technology Based on IGZO Semiconductor for Notebook LCDs Wei Yang, Qiang Shu, Huaipei Wang, Jie Li, Zhijun Wang R&D Center, Nanjing CEC Panda FPD Technology Co., Ltd, Nanjing/Jiangsu, China Abstract We proposed a DEMUX (De-multiple) technology based on IGZO BCE-type TFT structure and produced the 13.3 inches FHD LCDs for notebook. The adoption of DEMUX 1:3 circuit on In the IGZO DEMUX LCDs, the driving architecture is Zigzagcolumn inversion, which is commonly applied in medium-sized LCDs to achieve a display quality of dot inversion by pixels arrangement. In this paper, a display issue of the slight horizontal streaks that can be observed on mixed color images (RG/GB/RB) under middle and low grayscale is analyzed and discussed in detail combing with the results of SILVACO simulations and waveform adjustment experiments.\n\n The IGZO BCE-type TFT\nIn order to save the mask costs and reduce the circuit area, a back-channel etching (BCE) process is adopted. The normal ESL-type TFT needs a larger design area for contact holes between channel layer and Source/Drain layer. Compare to it, the BCE-type TFT structure is conducive to achieve high PPI\nLCDs. For IGZO DEMUX technology, the adoption of BCE\nprocess can decrease the design area of DEMUX circuit to narrow the panel down border. Figure 1 shows the IGZO BCEtype TFT structure applied to DEMUX circuit and other places on panel.\n\nFigure 1. the IGZO BCE-type TFT structure 3.\n DEMUX LCD Architecture\n\n![0_image_0.png](0_image_0.png)\n\nFigure 2 shows the picture of 13.3 inches IGZO DEMUX 1:3 demo. The panel architecture is shown in Figure 3. The multiplexer type is 1 to 3 that one source signal is divided into three channels to send to active area of LCD respectively.\n\nGenerally, a column inversion driving is adopted in panel for lower logic consumption. For a sub-pixel, the ideal optical response waveform should be a 60Hz wave shape. However, the actual sub-pixel optical response waveform often is changed to 30Hz which is recognizable for human eyes due to the Vp voltage shift caused by the actual Vcom voltage offset and liquid crystal leakage of the LCD. For medium-sized LCDs with larger size sub-pixels, if only a simple column inversion driving is adopted, the vertical line flicker can be observed on screen. It will reduce the display quality of LCDs. Therefore, a Zigzagcolumn inversion is applied to drive pixels as shown in Figure 3.\n\nThe adjacent pixels own the opposite driving polarity, so their waveforms are spatially fused that the human eye can't distinguish the flicker existing in each sub-pixel.\n\nFigure 2 13.3 inches IGZO DEMUX module demo\n\n![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)\n\n![1_image_1.png](1_image_1.png)\n\nFigure 3. DEMUX 1:3 driving architecture with Zigzagcolumn inversion 4.\n\n The charging of DEMUX LCD\nThe main factors affecting the charging of DEMUX LCD pixels are the MUX TFT size, the RC loading of active area source lines and the charging time of source lines. For the normal design LCD, the IC outputs are connected to the active area source lines one by one, while for the DEMUX 1:3 LCD, one IC\noutput signal is controlled by three MUX TFTs and transmitted to three corresponding active area source lines in a time-sharing manner.\n The charging time of the source lines and the corresponding pixel rows is only 1/3 of the normal design LCD. If the charging ability of MUX TFT and pixel TFT is insufficient, there is a risk of insufficient of pixel charging. Because of the difference in mobility, the IGZO TFT with the same size has a lower charging ability than that of LTPS TFT. The resistance and capacitance of IGZO TFT itself will cause a certain signal delay in active area source lines. Therefore, it is essential to choose a proper IGZO MUX TFT size. Our simulation research has found that if the MUX TFT is large enough to ensure the signal delay in active source lines no longer decreasing with the MUX TFT size increasing, it means that the MUX TFT charging ability is saturated. In this situation, if the RC loading of source lines is too large and the charging time is too short, the expected potential of source lines still can't be reached and the corresponding pixels cannot be charged to preset potential too, even if the TFT size and charging time of pixels are sufficient.\n\n The slight horizontal streaks issue Through the quality evaluation and testing, we found that the full screen slight horizontal streaks can always be observed on DEMUX 1:3 LCD samples under middle and low grayscale when showing RG/GB/RB mixed color images. At the frame frequency of 60Hz, the horizontal streaks cannot disappear by adjusting the driving waveform. At the frame frequency of 30Hz, firstly we set the charging time of MUX CK to be the same as at 60Hz. By adjusting the time interval between Gn and CKA rising time, the horizontal streaks still can be observed. In this way, the influence of wrong charging on horizontal streaks was excluded. After then, the time interval between Gn and CKC falling time was adjusted to ensure that the feedthrough recovery time of the MUX CKC charging pixels were sufficient, however, the horizontal streaks still existed. Finally, we set an appropriate driving waveform relationship and double the charging time of source lines at 30Hz frame frequency, the slight horizontal streaks on screen disappeared with a little flicker. Therefore, the horizontal streaks is related to the insufficient charging time. The detail generation mechanism was analyzed with the help of SILVACO software modeling and simulation.\n\n6. **SILVACO modeling and simulation**\nTo analyze the slight horizontal streaks issue, we used Gateway software to model the panel circuit architecture. The modeling schematic is shown in Figure 4. The driving timing was set the same as the actual IC driving timing for the mixed color (RG) image with Zigzag-column inversion driving as shown in Figure 5. The driving timing of MUX CK was ABCABC. The simulation was carried out with a matched modelcard of LCD\nsamples by Smartspice software. The Smartspice simulation results were checked and analyzed. We found that the occurrence of horizontal streaks was related to the Zigzagcolumn inversion driving architecture.\n\nFigure 4. The circuit modeling schematic of DEMUX panel\n\n![1_image_2.png](1_image_2.png)\n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)\n\nFigure 5. The ABCABC driving timing of RG mixed color image 7.\n The generation mechanism of horizontal\n\n## Streaks\n\nIn Zigzag-column inversion driving LCD, some fixed-position source lines connect with both R and G pixels, such as S2 and S5 shown in Figure 3. In order to show RG mixed color image, these source lines need to be charged in each pixel row. The corresponding MUX TFTs turn on and the source lines are charged with VDH potential by IC output. When the MUX TFT turn off, the source lines potential is maintained. Because these source lines are charged both in odd and even rows, their potential are always at the expected VDH state. This can be regard as a \"pre-charge\" effect for these source lines. Therefore, the connecting R and G pixels could be charged to expected VDH potential because of the \"pre-charge\" effect.\n\nHowever, for some other fixed-position source lines such as S1, S3, S4, S6, the connecting pixels are one of R or G pixels and the other connecting pixels are B. These source lines are not always at the expected VDH potential sate in one frame since the connecting B pixels need to be charge to VDL under RG mixed color image. These source lines are charged from VDL to VDH every time when the corresponding R or G pixels need to be charged. This means there is no \"pre-charge\" effect for these source lines. If the driving ability of MUX TFT insufficient without enough TFT size, the RC loading of source lines heavy or the charging time of MUX TFT too short, these source lines without \"pre-charge\" effect only can be charged to a lower V'DH potential as shown in Figure 6. The corresponding R or G pixels also only can be charged to the lower V'DH potential.\n\nConsequently, the charging of R and G pixels connected with S1 and S5 source lines and connected with S1, S3, S4, S6 is different. The charging potential difference of these fixedposition pixels exists in each grayscale display. In high grayscale display, the brightness difference caused by the pixel charging potential difference is too small and not enough to be observed by the human eyes. But in middle and low grayscale display, the brightness difference is too large to be observed obviously. Therefore, the charging difference of source lines results in the slight horizontal streaks issue of RG mixed color image under middle and low grayscale display. The same simulation and analysis method are used for GB and RB mixed color images, it is found that their horizontal streaks issue generation mechanism is consistent with that of RG mixed color image.\n\nFigure 6. Driving timing of IGZO DEMUX LCD for RG\n\n![2_image_1.png](2_image_1.png)\n\nimage and the charging of source lines and pixels To verify the above simulation and analysis results, a series tests were conducted. Under RG/GB/RB color mixing image, we respectively moved the falling edge of the MUX CK waveform which corresponding to the undercharged source lines properly as analyzed above to increase the time of the MUX TFT turned on. Thereby the charging time of the source lines was increased, and the source lines were charged to a higher potential. If the horizontal streaks become lighten or disappear, it can be demonstrated that the horizontal streaks are indeed caused by the reason as above analyzed. Finally, in all the experiment we observed that the horizontal streaks under RG/GB/RB mixed color images screen are all alleviated. Therefore, the above analysis results were confirmed.\n\n Conclusion In this paper, we reported the 13.3 inches FHD DEMUX LCDs which were manufactured by IGZO BCE-type TFT structure. The narrow bezel less than 15mm has been realized combing with TED technology. The generation mechanism of slight horizontal streaks issue observed on RG/GB/RB mixed color images under middle and low grayscale display was analyzed. According to modeling and simulation, it was found that the Zigzag-column inversion driving architecture can cause the charging difference of fixed-position source lines in active area because of the insufficient charging of source lines.\n\nConsequently, the corresponding connecting pixels of these source lines are charged to different potential resulting in the slight horizontal streaks issue.\n\n References\n[1] Moez K.

While the device without any passivation layer showed a huge threshold voltage Vth- shift under positive gate voltage stress, the suitably passivated device did not exhibit any Vth shift. The charge trapping model, which has been believed to be a plausible mechanism, cannot by itself explain this behavior. Instead, the Vth instability was attributed to the interaction between the exposed IGZO backsurface and oxygen and/or water in the ambient atmosphere during the gate voltage stress. © *2008 American Institute of Physics*.\n\nDOI: 10.1063/1.2990657 The ZnO-based transistors have a strong potential to be used in emerging electronic devices including the thin film transistor TFT- backplanes for flexible displays or transparent active matrix organic light-emitting diode AMOLED-\ndisplays because they offer high mobility, excellent uniformity, and good transparency to visible light, compared with conventional amorphous Si and polycrystalline Si TFTs.1–4 For practical applications, it is crucial for oxide transistors to exhibit voltage independent stability or reliability. Although high performance oxide TFTs have previously been reported,1–4 an unambiguous understanding of the dominant mechanism of the device instability is still lacking. In the case of amorphous Si TFTs, the device instability has been attributed to two different mechanisms: charge trapping in the gate dielectric or the creation of metastable danglingbond states in amorphous Si.5–8 While amorphous Si has strong covalent bonding due to its hybrid sp3 orbitals, which act as a building unit, amorphous indium-gallium-zinc oxide IGZO- material shows an ionic character due to the large difference in electronegativity between the heavy metal cations and oxygen atoms. Nevertheless, the threshold voltage Vth- instabilities of oxide transistors under gate voltage stress have mainly been attributed solely to the charge trapping at or near the oxide channel layer and gate dielectric based on the amorphous Si framework without any direct evidence for this assertion.9–12 Furthermore, no attention has been paid to the ambient effect under gate voltage stress, although none of the devices that were evaluated had any suitable passivation layer.9–12 However, because oxygen and water in the ambient atmosphere are known to affect the transistor properties, the adsorption/desorption dynamics of these molecules onto the exposed back-channel region of the oxide transistor might play an important role during bias stress.13–16 The reported device instability of oxide TFTs might be largely related to the adverse environmental effect that results from this, and thus, the possibility of the reliability of the oxide semiconductor itself being underestimated cannot be ruled out.\n\nIn this letter, we present an experiment that we conducted to closely examine the effect of the ambient atmosphere on the electric-field-induced instability of IGZO transistors. For this purpose, short channel transistors W/L\n= 25/10 m- with an organic photoacryl PA- and plasmaenhanced chemical-vapor deposition PECVD--derived SiOx film as a passivation layer were fabricated by photolithography and dry or wet etching process. It was found that oxygen is adsorbed on the IGZO surface under the positive gate voltage stress PGVS- and that is largely responsible for the observed positive Vth shift. The fabrication procedure of the IGZO transistors, which have a bottom gate structure with a passivation layer, was previously reported in detail.4 The passivation layer was on the top side of the IGZO thin film.\n\nThen, Mo source/drain electrode was deposited and patterned by dry etching.\n\nThe field-effect mobility fe- of 8.4 cm2 /V s and Ion/off ratio of -108 for the organic passivated device device A-\nwere comparable to those 10.8 cm2 /V s, -108- for the inorganic passivated device device B-, as shown in Figs. 1a- and 1b-. However, there is a dramatic difference in the subthreshold gate swing S- value of the two devices, as shown in Fig. 1d-. The S value of device B 0.62 V/decadeis superior to that 0.90 V/decade- of device A.\n\nNext, we investigated the effect of the passivation material on the bias stability of the resulting a-IGZO TFTs. The device was stressed under the following conditions: the IDS\nwas set to 10 A and the VDS was fixed at 5.1 V. The maximum stress duration was 36 000 s. Considering that a IDS of approximately 1 A is required to manifest the full white gray color in the AMOLED device,17 the applied stress current 10 A- corresponds to very severe test conditions.\n\nFigures 1a- and 1b- show the evolution of the transfer curves as a function of the applied stress time for devices A and B, respectively. It can be seen that while device A shows a change in the S value as well as a large positive Vth shift during bias stress, a parallel Vth shift to a higher gate voltage with increasing stress time without any significant change in the field-effect mobility, S, or Ion/off ratio was observed for device B. Figure 1c- shows the variations in the positive Vth shift for both devices with the stress time. Although the Vth for the device A was strongly shifted by approximately 8.1 V\na-Electronic mail: jaekyeong.jeong@samsung.com.\n\nb-Electronic mail: ygmo@samsung.com.\n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)\n\nfrom 5.5 to 13.6 V, the positive Vth shift in device B was very small 2.0 V- after a constant drain current stress of 36 000 s.\n\nThe positive Vth shift in oxide TFTs under PGVS has been explained by two models: charge trapping or defect creation.9–12 While the parallel shift in Vth without significant change in the S value during stress time is attributed to simple charge trapping in the gate dielectric and/or at the channel/dielectric interface, the positive shift in Vth accompanying the change in S comes from the creation of defects within the oxide semiconductor channel material. In addition, it has been claimed that the recovery behavior of Vth without any thermal annealing excludes the possibility of charge injection into the gate dielectric.9 In this study, because devices A and B have an identical gate dielectric and IGZO semiconductor, the charge trapping at or near the channel/dielectric interface during gate voltage stress would be expected to be similar to each other. However, the positive Vth shifts for devices A and B were 8.1 and 2.0 V, respectively. Here, we note that the Vth 5.5 V- of the pristine device A is larger than that 1.1 V- of device B. Thus, the difference in the instability of Vth between the two devices may be caused by the difference in the gate voltage initially applied to induce the 10 A drain current because the effectively large vertical electrical field for device A causes more charge trapping.12 Figure 2 shows the effect of the constant gate voltage stress on both devices. The application of identical gate voltage stress to both devices VGS= 15 V, VDS\n= 0 V, time= 3600 s- still resulted in consistent Vth instability: the positive Vth shifts for devices A and B were 3.5 and 0.42 V, respectively. Therefore, the charge trapping model alone cannot entirely account for the results obtained. To obtain more insight into the ambient effect, the bias-induced instability on the IGZO transistor without any passivation layer was examined and the results are included in Fig. 2. Interestingly, the unpassivated device exhibited an interme-\n\n![2_image_1.png](2_image_1.png) \n\ndiate Vth shift 1.62 V- after the application of PGVS for 1 h.\n\nObviously, the interaction between the active backchannel and ambient played a critical role in determining the Vth instability. It is well known that adsorbed oxygen can capture an electron from the conduction band and that the resulting oxygen species can exist in various forms such as O2−, O−, or O2−, as described by the following chemical reaction. As a result of charge transfer, a depletion layer is formed beneath the Zn-based oxide surface, leading to an increase in the Vth of the transistor,13,14\n\n## O2Gas- + E − = 2O−Solid-.\n\nThe equilibrium constant K is given by O−solid /PO2n, where O−solid, PO2, and n are the adsorbed oxygen concentration on the IGZO surface, the partial oxygen pressure, and the electron density in the channel, respectively. As pointed out in a previous report,13 an increase in PO2 results in a positive Vth shift in the resulting oxide transistor because the equilibrium constant K should be invariant at a fixed temperature, and as a result, the concentration of Osolid\n− increases. Likewise, when VGS is positive, the accumulated electron density n in the channel region increases and the resulting adsorbate concentration of Osolid\n−  is also increased, giving rise to an increase in the Vth of the transistor, which is schematically shown in Fig. 3a-. In fact, there have been several reports on the electric-field-induced adsorption or migration of molecules on polycrystalline ZnO materials.18–20 Because the electronegativities of In 1.78- and Ga 1.81- are\n\n![2_image_2.png](2_image_2.png)\n\nsimilar to that of Zn 1.65-, it is quite reasonable to expect oxygen to be adsorbed/desorbed on the surface of the IGZO\nfilm under the influence of an electric field. Therefore, the positive Vth shift in the PGVS stress should be carefully considered.\n\nBased on the above discussion, the observed experimental results can be clearly explained. The huge positive Vth shift in the unpassivated device 1.2 V, Fig. 2- resulted from the superimpositions of the Vth shifts due to the increased negatively charged-oxygen adsorption and charge trapping at the dielectric/channel layer. However, in the SiOx passivated device, the adsorption of additional oxygen from the ambient atmosphere is kinetically prevented by the diffusion barrier property of the SiOx thin film 100 nm-, thereby resulting in a much smaller Vth shift 0.42 V-.\n\nFigure 1d- shows the variations in the S value for both devices with the stress time. For device A, the subthreshold slope became rapidly steeper during initial bias stress: the S\nvalue was reduced from 0.90 to 0.49 V/decade after the application of bias stress for 3600 s. However, no such change in the S value was observed for device B. This observation also cannot be explained by the charge trapping model. Previously, we reported that the water adsorption/desorption process on the IGZO surface involves trap creation/removal in the active layer, indicating that H2O molecules can act as electron trap centers as well as electron donors on the IGZO\nsurface.14 It is expected that some of the positively charged water molecules on the surface will be desorbed upon the application of a positive gate bias, as shown in Fig. 3b-.\n\nTherefore, their desorptions would result in the simultaneous, additional positive Vth shift and decrease in the S\nvalue. This is believed to be the case for device A because the organic PA layer tends to cause the intake of moisture upon its exposure to the ambient atmosphere. Therefore, the initial rapid Vth shift and change in the S value for device A\nwere mainly attributed to the electric-field-induced water desorption. We note that the PA-passivated device showed larger Vth shift than an unpassivated device. In the case of an unpassivated device, only O2 adsorption contributes to the positive Vth shift. However, the PA-passivated device might suffer from H2O desorption as well as O2 adsorption during PGVS. Indeed, the PA layer is permeable to the diffusion of oxygen or water molecule because the diffusion barrier property for organic materials is quite poor water vapor transmission rate of 1 g/m2 day and oxygen transmission rate of 3 mL/m2 day Refs. 21 and 22-. This would be responsible for the largest Vth shift being observed in the PApassivated device, as shown in Fig. 2.\n\nOur interpretation of the origin of the Vth instability is reinforced by the observation recently reported by Levy et al.23 They found that the positive Vth shift in a ZnO TFT\nunder the application of gate voltage stress VGS= 20 V, t\n= 16 h- can be reduced from 2.4 V unpassivated device- to 0.6 V by using a 100-nm-thick Al2O3 passivation layer.\n\nHowever, they did not provide any explanation for this observation. We believe that the superior stability of the ZnO\ntransistor with the Al2O3 passivation comes from the better barrier property of Al2O3 material compared to that of PECVD-derived SiOx materials. Indeed, the IGZO transistor having a denser SiOx thin film as a passivation layer did not show any significant positive Vth shift 0.01 V- under the following conditions IDS= 10 m, VDS= 5.1 V, t= 3600 s-,\nas shown in Fig. 2.\n\nIn summary, it was shown that the positive Vth shift during PGVS comes not only from the charge trapping, but also from the dynamic interaction between the exposed backchannel and the ambient atmosphere. The contribution of the back-channel region to the huge Vth instability can be suppressed by the insertion of a proper passivation layer: The positive Vth shift during constant drain current stress was dramatically improved by passivating the IGZO backchannel with an inorganic SiOx layer. Therefore, a suitable passivation layer is essential to improve the long-term reliability of oxide TFTs.\n\n1K. Nomura, H. Ohta, A. Takagi, T. Kamiya, M. Hirano, and H.

First, an overview is provided on how electrical performance may be enhanced by the adoption of specific device structures and process schemes, the combination of various oxide semiconductor materials, and the appropriate selection of gate dielectrics and electrode metals in contact with the semiconductor. As metal oxide TFT devices are excellent candidates for switching or driving transistors in next generation active matrix liquid crystal displays (AMLCD) or active matrix organic light emitting diode (AMOLED) displays, the major parameters of interest in the electrical characteristics involve the field effect mobility (μFE), threshold voltage (Vth), and subthreshold swing (SS). A\nstudy of the stability of amorphous oxide TFT devices is presented next. Switching or driving transistors in AMLCD or AMOLED displays inevitably involves voltage bias or constant current stress upon prolonged operation, and in this regard many research groups have examined and proposed device degradation mechanisms under various stress conditions. The most recent studies involve stress experiments in the presence of visible light irradiating the semiconductor, and different degradation mechanisms have been proposed with respect to photon radiation. The last part of this review consists of a description of methods other than conventional vacuum deposition techniques regarding the formation of oxide semiconductor films, along with some potential application fields including flexible displays and information storage.\n\n© 2011 Elsevier B.V.

All rights reserved.\n\ndoi:10.1016/j.tsf.2011.07.018 amorphous oxide semiconductor (AOS) TFT device research, especially for next generation flat panel display (FPD) applications.\n\nCompared to amorphous silicon (a-Si), TFT devices that act as switching transistors in active matrix liquid crystal displays\n(AMLCD), which typically exhibit field effect mobility values lower than 1 cm2/Vs [2–4], much higher electrical performance can be achieved using n-type oxide semiconductors, with practical field effect mobility values exceeding 5 cm2/Vs.\n\nThe major advantage of oxide semiconductor materials is that they can be deposited using conventional semiconductor process methods such as sputtering at room temperature, and their amorphous structure enables the realization of uniform device properties over large areas. Because of such remarkable characteristics, oxide semiconductor TFTs are excellent candidate switching elements for large area (N70 in.), ultra definition (UD, 4000× 2000), and fast frame rate (N240 Hz) AMLCD panels. By properly implementing IGZO TFT arrays, Samsung Electronics successfully developed a 70-inch 240 Hz 3D UD TV prototype that was presented at FPD International 2010 in November [5].\n\nIn addition to AMLCDs, oxide semiconductor TFTs are also promising alternatives to low temperature poly-silicon (LTPS) TFTs that are used as driving elements in active matrix organic lightemitting diode (AMOLED) displays. Despite the high electrical performance of LTPS TFTs that exhibit typical field effect mobility values close to 100 cm2/Vs, the non-uniform spatial distribution of poly-Si grain structure in LTPS films results in non-uniform device properties over large areas, which is the reason why current AMOLED displays are limited to relatively small size applications such as mobile cell phones. Accordingly, several companies have demonstrated working prototype AMOLED panels driven by AOS TFTs [6–8].\n\nAmorphous oxide semiconductor devices have thus been drawing worldwide attention during the past few years, and display companies are now very close to achieving mass production of commercial products that integrate AOS TFT backplanes. In that regard, the present article aims at providing a review on the recent development of AOS TFT devices and the major issues that need to be addressed in order to succeed in the transition from basic research to product generation. The first section consists of an overview on the enhancement of device performance. The electrical characteristics of TFT devices are represented by the field effect mobility (μFE),\nthreshold voltage (Vth), and subthreshold swing (S). Such parameters strongly depend on the device structure and fabrication process, the AOS materials, and the gate dielectrics or interconnect metals in contact with the semiconductor. Because fast switching is the key role of TFT devices in electronic applications, one would in general target high μFE values, Vth close to zero, and SS values as small as possible.\n\nThe next section discusses reliability issues concerning AOS TFT\ndevices. As the pixel TFTs in AMLCD or AMOLED panels in operation constantly undergo either gate bias stress or constant current stress, it is important to understand the behavior of the devices under such stress conditions. The associated device degradation usually occurs in the form of Vth shifts, which are occasionally accompanied by severe losses in field effect mobility. In order to promote reasonable product lifetime in display panels, it is thus imperative to minimize the susceptibility of AOS TFTs with respect to voltage or current stress.\n\nThe last section presents methods other than conventional vacuum deposition techniques for the formation of AOS thin films.\n\nSolution-based processes are reviewed, and some potential applications where the integration of AOS TFTs may be effective are discussed, including flexible electronics and information storage.\n\n## 2. Optimization Of Aos Tft Device Performance\n\nThe electrical characteristics which determine device performance are evaluated in terms of several parameters such as field effect mobility (μFE), threshold voltage (Vth), and subthreshold swing (S).\n\nThese parameters are in general extracted in compliance with the gradual channel approximation. By measuring the drain current (IDS) with respect to gate voltage (VG), the mobility can be obtained from Eq. (1),\n\n$$I_{\\mathrm{DS}}={\\frac{W}{L}}\\mu C_{i}\\left[(V_{C}-V_{t h})V_{D S}-{\\frac{V_{D S}^{2}}{2}},\\right.$$\n$$(1)$$\n\nwhere μ denotes the mobility in the channel, Vth the threshold voltage, and VG the applied gate voltage. VDS is the source-drain voltage, and Ci is the capacitance of the gate insulator per unit area.\n\nThe saturation mobility (μsat) is obtained from IDS in the saturation regime under the condition VDS≫(VG–Vth) using the following equation:\n\nI\n2\nDS =ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n$${\\sqrt{\\frac{W}{2L}\\mu C_{i}}}(V_{C}-V_{t h}).$$\n$$(2)$$\nrVG−Vth ð Þ: ð2Þ\nIn the small VG regime (linear region), the mobility is defined as the linear field-effect mobility. Generally, IDS–VG curves are nonlinear, so the maximum value of μFE is often reported. The apparent fieldeffect mobility induced by the transconductance gm at a low drain voltage is determined by\n\nμFE = Lgm\n$${\\frac{L_{\\mathrm{{gsm}}}^{\\mathrm{{m}}}}{r_{\\mathrm{{C}}_{i}}V_{D S}}}\\,.$$\n$\\left(3\\right)$. \n: ð3Þ\nAnother important TFT parameter is the subthreshold swing (S),\nwhich reflects the amount of VG change required to increase IDS by an order of magnitude in the subthreshold region. From the transfer characteristics, S can be extracted using the equation:\n\n$$1\\ {\\frac{d V_{S}}{d(\\ {\\log}_{10}I_{D S})}}.$$\n$$(4)$$\nS = dVS\nd log10 IDS ð Þ: ð4Þ\nThe S value also provides important information about the quality of a TFT. It is related to the total trap density Nt near the semiconductor/gate dielectric interface by:\n\n$$N_{\\rm t}=\\left[\\frac{S\\log(e)}{kT/q}-1\\right]\\frac{C_{i}}{q}.\\tag{5}$$  Here, k is the Boltzmann constant and q is the charge of an \nelectron.\n\n## 2.1. Device Structure\n\nFig. 1 illustrates typical device structures that are adopted in the fabrication of amorphous oxide semiconductor TFTs. The TFT\nstructure can be specified by the stacking order of the gate, oxide semiconductor, and source/drain electrodes. They can be classified more precisely into combinations of top/bottom gate and top/bottom contact. The top-gate structure was employed to fabricate devices with epitaxial semiconductor layers, for which it is difficult to form bottom electrodes [9]. This structure has another advantage in that the upper gate insulator and electrodes may act as a passivation, which protects the channel layer from external damage. The top gate structure was studied in the early stage of oxide semiconductor research owing to simple fabrication methods that involve as few as two patterning mask steps [1,10]. Top gate structures were then studied to enhance the device performance by reducing the parasitic capacitance [11] and the photosensitivity with respect to light emanating from the upper OLED [12].\n\nMeanwhile, inverted staggered structures, which are the structures generally adopted in the fabrication of conventional a-Si:H\nTFTs, have been employed in most prototype displays. However, this\n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)\n\nFig. 1. Typical device structures used to fabricate amorphous oxide semiconductor TFTs.\n\nstructure has several disadvantages. For example, (i) the back channel surface is exposed to the atmosphere, and therefore the TFT\ncharacteristics can be affected by atmospheric gasses and (ii) the back channel surfaces can suffer damage from subsequent source/drain patterning or back channel etch processes. To overcome these problems, either an etch stopper or an appropriate passivation may be applied to the TFTs, and these in turn can be classified into etch stopper (ES) type and back channel etch (BCE) type devices. These structures employ bottom-gate and top-contact configurations. Both structures have been employed for the mass production of a-Si:H TFTs and are also widely used for AOS TFTs. Early AMOLED display panels involving IGZO TFTs employed the inverted staggered structure, especially the BCE structure. [13] Such devices can be strongly affected by the atmosphere due to the exposure of the back channel layer. This disadvantage induces motivation for the development of suitable passivation layers. Previously, Jeong et al. showed that passivated BCE\nAl–Zn–Sn–O TFTs had much better stability characteristics than devices without a protective layer. [14] However, permanent degradation in TFT characteristics occurring from damage during the back channel etch process cannot be avoided. To overcome this disadvantage, it is necessary to protect the back channel area during top source-drain formation.\n\nThe ES (etch-stopper) structure involves a protective layer on top of the active layer prior to forming the source and drain electrodes\n[15]. The etch-stopper structure is free from back channel damage, however it requires an extra patterning mask. The ES structure shows characteristics superior to the BCE structure, especially under bias stress [13]. Also, Park et al. showed that better TFTs characteristics can be obtained by applying a double etch-stopper structure using a consecutive stack of 150 °C and 350 °C PE-CVD SiO2 films [16]. Since the etch stopper layer does not completely isolate the underlying semiconductor from external contamination such as moisture diffusion, the application of a passivation top layer is as important in the ES structure as in the BCE structure. Park et al. showed that the use of SiNx passivation may result in high mobility, however an SiO2 passivation is more advantageous regarding device degradation, as hydrogen diffusion from the SiNx passivation layer down to the active layer results in more severe device degradation upon bias stress [17].\n\nThere is another structure called co-planar in which the source/\ndrain contacts are formed in the same plane as the channel layer (for example, bottom gate and bottom contact). This structure has some advantages such as low contact resistance with source/drain contacts, and its use has also recently been proposed for a-IGZO TFTs [18,19].\n\nIn addition to these conventional structures, double gate TFTs have been studied to improve the electrical characteristics. In such structures, an additional gate can effectively control a larger portion in the vertical direction of the semiconductor bulk. Previously, Lim et al. obtained field effect mobility values about twice as high as single gate TFTs, and subthreshold swing values lower by approximately half that of a single gate structure [20]. Also, double gate TFTs are reported to exhibit excellent device stability [21].\n\n## 2.2. Active Layer\n\nIn the active matrix liquid crystal display (AMLCD) industry, the use of high-performance transistors with high field-effect mobility above 5 cm2/Vs is necessary [22] in order to achieve high-resolution such as ultra-definition (4000× 2000), large size (N70 in.), and high frame rate operation (N240 Hz). In this regard, ZnO-based TFTs have been intensively studied as promising alternatives to conventional aSi TFTs. The applications of polycrystalline ZnO (poly-ZnO) to TFTs have been studied because the use of poly-ZnO is known to result in reasonable switching capability even when fabricated at low temperatures below 300 °C. The first report on TFTs using single crystal ZnO was published in 1968 [23]. After a long incubation period, ZnO TFT research was revisited with many papers appearing after 2003 [24–26]. Then, Elvira et al. developed fully transparent ZnO TFTs, with a room temperature process, exhibiting high mobility near 20 cm2/Vs [27]. However, such devices required relatively high gate voltages to turn-on, as they operated well into the enhancement mode. Lim et al. were able to control Vth by nitrogen (N) doping during the deposition of ZnO [28,29]. They used NH4OH injection for N\ndoping during atomic layer deposition and the N doping was shown to enhance device mobility as well as stability.\n\nZnO TFTs in former studies exhibited field effect mobility values ranging from 0.2 to 40 cm2/Vs by the optimization of the semiconductor microstructure, post annealing, and selection of gate insulator\n[30]. However, it is recognized that the formation of amorphous or single crystalline ZnO thin films is very difficult, and in general a polycrystalline structure is obtained, which leads to the formation of grain boundary defects. The existence of grain boundaries induces non-uniform TFT performance at different locations across a single flat panel display. Another problem is the difficulty of fabrication, which originates from the low chemical durability of pure ZnO against acidic etchants. Because of such problems, intensive research has been carried out on the development of amorphous metal oxide semiconductors with comparable or better device properties than those of ZnO TFTs.\n\nIn 2004, Nomura et al. used a new class of amorphous oxide semiconductors based on IGZO deposited at room temperature, and demonstrated high-performance transistors (μ≈8.3 cm2/Vs). [1]\nDespite the amorphous state, the origin of the high mobility was attributed to the electronic orbital structure of the material. As shown in Fig. 2, direct overlap between neighboring metal s orbitals can occur, and form a conducting path for free electrons which is not significantly affected even in a distorted amorphous structure. The conduction band in IGZO is mainly formed by the overlap of the In 5s orbitals, which exhibit isotropic properties. From Fig. 2, the spherical symmetry of the 5s orbitals renders the IGZO material insensitive to structural deformation, and the semiconductor maintains high mobility in the amorphous state. In comparison with Si that undergoes significant reduction in mobility from 1000 (single crystal)\nto 1 (amorphous) cm2/Vs, a-IGZO is thus a very promising material for switching or driving elements in future display products. Another important design concept of IGZO is that the incorporated Ga ions act as a carrier suppressor and network stabilizer in the conductive IZO\nhost [31]. This report drew significant attention worldwide, both from industry and academia, because of its potential in achieving high mobility, excellent spatial uniformity of the device parameters, and good scalability to large substrate sizes.\n\nFor the enhancement of device performance, optimization of the cation composition in IGZO TFTs has been actively studied. With increasing Ga content, the optical gap energy of IGZO films increases, and the turn-on voltage of the TFT shifts to positive values [32]. As the\n\n![3_image_0.png](3_image_0.png)\n\npotential barrier height increases at high Ga contents, the injection of carriers from the metal electrode to the IGZO becomes more difficult.\n\nIwasaki et al. developed optimum performance IGZO TFTs by combinatorial studies of In, Ga, and Zn compositions [33]. The corresponding devices exhibited high mobility and low Ion/Ioff ratios at high In concentrations. Also, composition variations and their effects on TFT\ncharacteristics were studied with respect to sputtering power [34].\n\nAlternative oxide semiconductor compounds have also been the subject of research. In four-component systems, Zn–In–Sn–O showed high field effect mobility (N10 cm2/Vs) [35,36]. However, In is a rare and expensive element, so it is not a material of preference for mass production in terms of cost-effectiveness. In this regard, Sn-doped ZnO TFTs have proven to be suitable as a replacement for In.\n\nPreviously, field effect mobility values of 10–15 cm2/Vs were obtained for Zn–Sn–O TFTs [37,38], and Al-doped SnO TFTs were fabricated as well [39]. Also, Ga–Zn–Sn–O devices were studied as four-component In-free oxide TFTs [40,41]. By using Zn as an alternative carrier suppressor, Zr–In–Zn–O TFTs showed comparable mobility and stability to IGZO TFTs under electrical stress; however, they exhibit a polycrystalline phase [42]. In comparison with Zr–In–Zn–O, an amorphous phase was obtained by using Hf–In–Zn–O (HIZO) [43].\n\nFig. 3 shows a cross-section of a polycrystalline IZO film (Fig. 3 (a),\nand (b)) and an amorphous thin film that results from Hf addition\n(Fig. 3 (c), and (d)). The Zr or Hf replacing Ga in the IGZO matrix was shown to act as a strong oxygen binder and carrier suppressor, leading to an improvement in the bias stability of the resulting TFTs.\n\nThe oxygen concentration is one of the key parameters that influences TFT characteristics, as oxygen vacancies are the major source of free carriers. By optimizing oxygen content, very high mobility (46 cm2/Vs), high performance (subthreshold swing=\n0.54 V/decade, Vth≈0 V), devices can be obtained [44]. In addition, undesired subthreshold photocurrent in the presence of visible light can be significantly reduced by properly optimizing the sputtering power and O2/Ar gas flow ratio during deposition [45]. Because the TFTs are exposed to visible light from the underlying backlight unit in a working AMLCD or AMOLED panel, the susceptibility of oxide TFTs with respect to illumination should be minimized. After device fabrication, annealing in an oxygen ambient can affect the oxygen concentration within the active layer. Especially, wet O2 annealing is more effective in reducing the density of electron traps, which helps to enhance TFT performance [46].\n\nFor the enhancement of field effect mobility and stability with respect to photon radiation, double active layer structures have been studied as well. By using an ITO/IGZO double active stack, excellent TFT properties with a high mobility of 104 cm2/Vs, suitable Vth of 0.5 V, and a subthreshold swing of 0.25 V/decade were demonstrated [47]. The control of a thin layer in the back channel region by using a high resistivity top layer resulted in the enhancement of the subthreshold properties. For instance, a Cu-doped IGZO back channel exhibited high on/off ratio and reduced subthreshold swing [48]. Also, Maeng et al. effectively reduced the subthreshold photocurrent by modulating the cation composition of the back channel layer [49].\n\nFig. 4 (a) and (b) shows the transfer curves of TFTs with In-rich (low resistive) and In-poor (high resistive) back channels, measured in the dark and under illumination. Relatively large amounts of photocurrent in the subthreshold region of the In-rich back channel device are observed, while in the In-poor back channel device, negligible photocurrent was obtained. This is indicative that while the front channel modulation is effective at enhancing the field effect mobility, back channel modulation controls the subthreshold properties of the device.\n\n2.3. Source/drain electrode and gate dielectric materials The effects of electrode material and gate dielectric in contact with the semiconductor are also important. Low power consumption is one of the key issues for mobile display applications, due to the limited capacity of the battery used as a power source. An effective approach to reducing power consumption is the application of high-k gate dielectrics to diminish the driving voltage range. Various high-k materials have been studied for TFT applications such as Al2O3 [28],\nY2O3 [10], BaSrTiO [50] and Ta2O5 [30]. Among the conventional high-\n\n![4_image_0.png](4_image_0.png)\n\nk materials, ZrO2 and HfLaO gate dielectrics showed high mobility\n(≈25 cm2/Vs) with comparable subthreshold swing [51,52]. The highest dielectric constant material that was employed in oxide semiconductor TFTs is BiZnNbO (k= 51) [53]. However, the mobility was not as high as expected (1.52 cm2/Vs). Such a low performance was also observed in the case of a TiO2 gate dielectric, comparable to the case with BiZnNbO. By systematic studies, it was suggested that a Coulomb scattering mechanism by phonon scattering from the large\n\n![4_image_1.png](4_image_1.png)\n\npolarization of a high-k gate dielectric can limit the channel mobility [54]. Also, for the application of the high-k gate dielectric, further investigation on high leakage currents, low band gap, interfacial reaction, and interface traps have to be performed.\n\nTo enhance the characteristics of oxide TFTs such as field effect mobility and Vth, control of the contact resistance between the source/drain and semiconductor is also a key issue. In CMOS Si technologies, doping by ion implantation or diffusion, which require high temperature annealing, are performed to lower the contact resistance. However, in the display industry, such high temperature treatments are practically impossible to carry out, due to the warping of large size glass or plastic substrates for flexible displays. Thus, plasma treatment or post process doping are generally used to lower the contact resistance. For example, field effect mobility was observed to increase by approximately three times by performing Ar plasma treatment on the active layer [55]. With Ar plasma treatment, the contact resistance of the IGZO TFT was reduced from 1550 to 330 Ω\ncm and the carrier concentration of IGZO films dramatically increased from 1014 cm−3 to 1020 cm−3.AH2 plasma treatment shows better mobility and lower contact resistance than Ar plasma treatment, since hydrogen can act as a shallow donor in the oxide semiconductor [18]. Hydrogen doping effects leading to the formation of Ohmic junctions were also observed in the case of hydrogen diffusion during SiN:H chemical vapor deposition (CVD) for the deposition of a passivation layer [19]. However, the plasma treatment or dry etch processes must be carefully controlled. The damage occurring from the plasma treatment or dry etch can induce conductor-like behavior due to a contact resistance that is too low and large back channel currents that may result from the segregation of In [56–58]. In such cases, highly negative gate voltages must be applied to deplete the conductive\n\n![5_image_0.png](5_image_0.png)\n\nactive layer. To reduce such deleterious effects, a N2O anneal process for re-oxidation of the IGZO surface can be effective [56,57]. Thus, reducing the conductivity of the active layer by treatments such as reoxidation, especially at the source/drain contact regions, may help to decrease the turn-on voltage to values near 0 V. A similar effect was observed by using a Ti/Cu bilayer electrode instead of Mo, with a single SiNx film employed as the passivation. Fig. 5 shows crosssectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of HIZO/Mo and HIZO/TiCu contact regions and shows the presence of an amorphous TiOx layer at the interface between the Ti adhesion layer and the underlying HIZO. This TiOx layer can induce almost 0 V turnon voltage by the suppression of carrier injection [59].\n\n## 3. Reliability Of Aos Tft Devices 3.1. The Origin Of Device Instability\n\nRecent efforts in AOS TFT research have been concentrating on improving the long-term stability of the devices in order to successfully implement them into AMLCD and/or AMOLED displays.\n\nA highly stable device would consist of a transistor that does not exhibit significant variations in Vth (ΔVth) upon prolonged operation, and no significant degradation in field effect mobility. For example, the driving current-induced threshold voltage shift should be considered in AMOLED driving transistors (T1 in Fig. 6 (a)) [60]. It has been reported that a Vth shift of the driving transistor by 0.1 V\ninduces variations in the resulting luminance of the OLED pixels by approximately 20%, which reflects the fact that the brightness of each pixel depends strongly on the drain current [61,62]. However, for switching TFTs in AMLCD backplanes (T2 in Fig. 6 (b)) and/or AMOLEDs (T2 in Fig. 6 (a)), the voltage stress-induced ΔVth is a very critical issue that must be taken into account in pixel circuit design.\n\nPreferably, maintaining a small ΔVth comparable to that of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) TFTs as well as preserving high field-effect mobility (μFE) values are necessary in order to successfully promote a reasonable lifetime for AOS TFT-based large-area highresolution AMLCD and AMOLED displays [63,64].\n\nCross et al. investigated the stability of TFTs incorporating sputtered ZnO as the channel layer under gate bias stress [65]. They found that positive gate-bias (VG) stress results in a positive shift in the transfer characteristics, while negative VG stress results in a negative shift. In Fig. 7, the effect of applying a 30 V bias on the gate contact of a ZnO TFT for a period of 104 s is shown. The TFT exhibits a positive Vth shift of approximately 30 V with unchanged subthreshold characteristics. This positive Vth shift upon application of a positive VG\nstress may be interpreted to occur by either negative charge trapping at the channel/gate insulator interface or negative charge injection into the gate dielectric bulk. The difference between these two mechanisms is that the charge injection model requires a larger detrapping energy barrier compared to the charge trapping model. It was observed that the devices spontaneously recover their initial state after a relaxation period of ~1 h without any thermal annealing, which suggests that the Vth shift may be attributed to charge trapping rather than charge injection. Similar charge trapping phenomena were also reported in oxide TFTs using amorphous a-IGZO as the channel material [66,67]. The charge trapping and subsequent redistribution of the trap charge in a deeper state can be described by the following stretched-exponential equation:\n\n$$V_0\\bigg\\{1-\\exp\\bigg[-\\bigg(\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\bigg)^\\beta\\bigg]\\bigg\\}$$\nΔVth = V0 1− exp − tτ\n β     ; ð6Þ\nwith V0=Vg−Vth,0, where t is the stress time, τ is the relaxation time\n\n![5_image_1.png](5_image_1.png)\n\nconstant, β is the stretched-exponential exponent, and Vth,0 is Vth\n\n![6_image_0.png](6_image_0.png)\n\nbefore applying the stress [68]. Fig. 8 shows the time dependence of ΔVth for IGZO TFTs under the application of a constant VGS of 15 V for 5× 104 s at room temperature [67]. The time dependence of ΔVth can be well fit by a stretched-exponential equation with a characteristic trapping time τ of 2 × 104 s and a stretched-exponential exponent β of 0.42.\n\nSuresh et al. reported that the charge injection mechanism is responsible for the positive Vth shift under positive VGS stress conditions [69]. By assuming a uniform distribution of trapping sites in the gate insulator, the total amount of injected charge can be obtained from the following equation, by integrating over time and the thickness of the gate insulator in which trapping sites are present:\n\nQ tð Þ = ∫ t\n$ \\int_0^t dt'\\int_0^x dt'$\n0 dx0Ntrϖ x\n0 \t  exp −ϖ x\n0  \f; ð7Þ\n$$x^{\\prime}]t^{\\prime}],$$\n\n![6_image_1.png](6_image_1.png)\n\nwhere Ntr is the density of traps in the gate insulator and ϖ(x)=\n\n![6_image_2.png](6_image_2.png)\n\nϖ0exp(−x/λ) is the time-independent tunneling probability. The tunneling constant λ is the product of the applied gate voltage and dielectric material parameters. By solving Eq. (2), charge injection via tunneling results in the following logarithmic dependence of the Vth shift:\n\n$$\\Delta V_{t h}=r_{0}\\,\\log\\Bigl({\\frac{t}{\\tau_{0}}}\\Bigr),$$\n$$({\\mathfrak{s}})$$\n ; ð8Þ\nwhere r0 is the decay rate constant, which is proportional to the product of Ntr and λ. Fig. 9 shows that the Vth change is linearly proportional to the logarithmic stress time, hence the degradation of IGZO TFTs may be attributed to charge injection involving tunneling of the channel carriers.\n\nHowever, because the TFTs are exposed to visible light originating from the underlying backlight unit in a working AMLCD panel or selfemitting radiation in AMOLED products, the susceptibility of oxide TFTs with respect to illumination should also be minimized in order to implement them into operating displays. A typical undesired phenomenon that occurs upon light exposure is non-zero subthreshold currents in the normally \"off\" region of the transfer curve, which is well known to be induced by excess photo-generated carriers within the semiconductor layer [21,70]. Under such adverse conditions, the pixels do not turn off when they should, and hence blurred images will be shown on the display. In addition, the switching TFTs in working AMLCD pixels are most of time experiencing a negative gate bias, maintaining the \"OFF\" state of the n-type transistor, which in general lasts more than 1000 times longer than the \"ON\" state [71]. Therefore, the device stability under negative bias illumination stress\n(NBIS) should be guaranteed in order to realize large-size and highresolution AMLCD and AMOLED displays incorporating AOS switching TFTs.\n\nShin et al. reported for the first time the bias stability characteristics of ZnO TFTs under visible light illumination [72]. The transfer curves exhibited almost no change under positive VG stress with illumination, while large negative shifts in Vth were observed under negative VG stress. The most plausible degradation mechanism of the ZnO TFTs under NBIS conditions was suspected to consist of photogenerated holes being trapped at the gate insulator and/or insulator/\nchannel interface. Lee et al. examined the impact of moisture on the photon-enhanced negative bias instability in IGZO TFTs [71]. It was observed that the negative Vth shift was accelerated by increasing the relative humidity under negative bias illumination stress conditions (see Fig. 10). Based on a hole trapping model, water related molecules\n\n![7_image_0.png](7_image_0.png)\n\nwere suggested to act as electron traps, resulting in the enhancement of electron–hole pair generation by photon excitation. Thus, the increase in hole carrier concentration trapped near the gate insulator/channel interface was suggested to be responsible for the acceleration of the negative V th shift.\n\nAn alternative instability mechanism under negative bias illumination has recently been proposed by Ghaffarzadeh et al. [73,74]. Passivated HIZO TFTs were observed to undergo negative Vth shifts uder NBIS conditions due to persistent photoconductivity, which leads to a long recovery time of the negatively shifted Vth. The origin of the persistent photoconductivity was attributed to the ionization of oxygen vacancy (Vo) sites, based on temperature and wavelengthdependent photoluminescence (PL) emission from the HIZO semiconductor. It was then suggested that photo-generated hole carriers may be physically localized at V O sites, of which the energy level is at approximately~2.3 eV above the valence band maximum of HIZO\n(see Fig. 11). As a result, the Vo sites become singly (V t ) or doubly\n\n![7_image_1.png](7_image_1.png)\n\nionized (V 2 + ) under illumination, and these in turn contribute free electrons which are responsible for the persistent photoconductivity. Therefore, it may be anticipated that light-induced instability of AOS TFTs can be improved by decreasing the concentration of V O sites within the channel and at interfaces.\n\nOh et al. also investigated possible origins of device degradation upon NBIS in a-IGZO TFTs [75,76]. Parallel shifts in the transfer curves were observed without significant changes in µ re and SS values, however substantial changes in capacitance-voltage characteristics suggested that the creation of subgap defect states in the channel layer dominate at sufficiently large gate bias voltages. Such defect levels were again suggested to occur from ionized oxygen vacancy sites ( V ổ + ) formed by the combination of visible light and negative gate bias. The V ô + states act as deep hole traps and provide free electron carriers in the IGZO TFT, which in turn result in negative shifts in Vth-\n\n## 3.2. Optimization Of Device Structure And Process\n\nIn order to improve the negative bias illumination stability of AOS\nTFTs, efforts have been made including adopting stable TFT structures [ 77 , 13 ], suitable gate insulator materials [ 78 , 79 ], impermeable passivation layers [ 17 , 80 ], robust semiconductors [45 , 81 ], and post annealing treatments [ 82 ]. Kwon et al. reported on the effect of device structure, by comparing bottom-gate TFTs with a backchannel-etch (BCE) structure or an etch-stopper (ES) configuration [ 13 ]. The stability of the BCE-type device was shown to be inferior to that of the ES-type device, which may be attributed to the formation of defective interfacial layers, containing, for example, MoO x Cl x complexes that remain after etching the Mo source/drain electrode on top of the IGZO\nlayer in the BCE type device. Kwon et al. also examined the effect of gate dielectric materials on the light-induced bias instability of HIZO TFTs [79] . They observed that the HfO x and SiN x dielectrics lead to poor device stability, while the stability is significantly improved by adopting SiO x as the gate dielectric. The superior stability of the SiO x gated devices was attributed to the suppression of hole injection or trapping in the gate dielectric, owing to a relatively large valence band offset with respect to the semiconductor, and lower hole trap density.\n\nPark et al. reported the influence of SiO x and SiN x passivations on the negative bias stability of HIZO TFTs under illumination [ 17 ]. The SiN x passivated devices exhibited higher µ FE , but more severe degradation under NBIS conditions. It was suggested that the incorporation of hydrogen during the SiN x deposition generates donor-like levels in the HIZO bulk and defects in the vincinity of the HIZO/gate insulator interface which act as hole trap centers. Kim et al. investigated the influence of sputtering deposition conditions of the HIZO channel layer on the negative bias illumination stability of HIZO\nTFTs [45]. Highly stable devices were fabricated by optimizing the deposition conditions (i.e., high sputtering power and high O2/Ar gas flow ratio), which may lead to fewer subgap defects states related to oxygen vacancies in the HIZO layer. Ji et al. studied the effect of highpressure oxygen annealing on negative bias illumination-induced instability of IGZO TFTs [82]. They found that the Vth shift can be significantly suppressed by high-pressure annealing under a 10 atm O2 ambient. The improved photo-stability was suggested to be associated with a decreased VO concentration in the annealed IGZO\nbased on x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results. This work also supports the instability mechanism involving the transition of VO to VO\n2+ by capturing photo-induced hole carriers under light illumination. Recently, theoretical first principles calculations have been performed to investigate the origin of the light-induced negative bias instability [83]. Ryu et al. suggested that oxygen vacancies (VO) act as hole traps and play an important role in the photo-excited Vth instability of oxide TFTs under negative bias stress. This is consistent with the hole trapping model proposed above, in that a net accumulation of positive charge at the channel/dielectric interface is the major cause of device degradation under negative bias illumination stress [83].\n\n## 4. Present And Future Issues In Oxide Semiconductor Applications\n\nAs described in previous sections, the major issues concerning oxide semiconductor TFT devices involve the improvement in electrical performance (such as achieving high mobility) and stability upon bias stress [84,85]. Since amorphous oxide semiconductors are very attractive in realizing large area displays (LCD and OLED), the deposition methods have been confined to the use of conventional semiconductor process equipment, compatible with amorphous silicon (a-Si) and/or low temperature poly-silicon (LTPS) technology\n[86–88]. However, alternative forms of electronic modules such as flexible and printable display, novel memory devices, and circuits are quickly emerging nowadays and it is anticipated that by implementing oxide semiconductors into these applications a new electronic paradigm will dominate the market in the near future [89–93]. In this regard, the current section focuses on two issues to provide an overview of the current trends in oxide semiconductor research: solutionprocessed metal oxide TFTs and novel electronic applications.\n\n## 4.1. Solution-Processed Metal Oxide Thin Film Transistors\n\nSolution process methods are attractive methods of fabricating TFTs in order to achieve low-cost production and cover large-areas.\n\nHere, the oxide semiconductor is in general formed either by coating or printing an aqueous solution, and subsequent annealing in air or in an inert atmosphere. Conventional methods used in the fabrication of oxide semiconductor devices are generally based on multiple photolithographic steps and vacuum-deposition processes. However, solution-processes may offer an innovative cost-down scheme while increasing the substrate size, reducing the number of mask steps, and eventually improving the production yield [90,94].\n\nFig. 12 (a) and (b) shows a simple chart that classifies the types of solution-processes and a schematic illustration of an oxide formation mechanism, respectively. As depicted in Fig. 12 (a), depending on the active material, coating, and solution type, solution-processed oxide semiconductors can be fabricated by various methods. The active materials are divided into organic, inorganic, and hybrid semiconductors. Although the solution process has been intensively explored in the field of organic (small molecule and polymer) semiconductors\n[95,96] and organic–inorganic hybrid materials [97], inorganic semiconductors are recently attracting much interest because of their high electrical performance (high mobility and on/off current ratio\n(Ion/off)). There are three types of materials in inorganic semiconb)\n\n![8_image_0.png](8_image_0.png)\n\n![8_image_1.png](8_image_1.png)\n\n![8_image_2.png](8_image_2.png)\n\nductors for solution process, including silicon, chalcogenides, and oxide semiconductors. The coating method for a solution process may be selected among spin-coating, printing (ink-jet, micro-contact, etc.),\nand chemical bath deposition (CBD). The solution for coating films can be prepared with soluble precursors or nanoparticles dispersed in a solvent. As shown in Fig. 12 (b), the metal oxide solution can result in uniform and continuous thin films on substrates after spin-coating and/or ink-jet printing. Aprotic solvents are highly volatile and do not dissociate the metal ligand precursor. The liquid thin film formed by the precursor readily loses the solvent and forms a uniform film, which then absorbs moisture from the ambient air. Finally, a solid metal oxide thin film is formed by a substitution reaction between water and metal ligands.\n\nSolution-processed oxide TFTs were initially fabricated with a CBD\nZnO film using Zn-acetate [Zn(CH3COO)2–2H2O, ZnAcc] dissolved in 2-methyoxyethanol [98], or spin-coated ZnO using Zn-nitrate [Zn\n(NO3)2–6H2O] in DI water [99]. The electrical performance of the corresponding TFTs exhibited a mobility of 0.2 cm2/V.s and an Ion/off\n\n| jet, CBD: chemical bath deposition). Year Material Coating Solut.

In terms of\n\n![10_image_2.png](10_image_2.png)\n\nmobility, Ong et al. [100] were able to further increase the mobility of spin-coated ZnO-TFTs by controlled annealing at 500 °C to enhance the (002) preferred orientation of ZnO. Then, the mobility of the TFT\nincreased to a value as high as 5.25 cm2/V.s.\n\nThe process temperature is also an important factor that is critical in determining whether solution-processing is advantageous compared to other semiconductor and/or conventional vacuum processes.\n\nCheng et al. [101] grew a ZnO film using CBD with subsequent annealing at 100 °C. They obtained a mobility of 0.25 cm2/V.s with a bottom gate TFT. Lia et al. [102] reported low temperature growth of ZnO at 60 °C for flexible electronics, resulting in a mobility of 0.56 cm2/V.s. In addition, ZnO TFTs, fabricated with ZnO nanorods, also exhibit potential at low temperatures, below 230 °C, and even down to room temperature [103,104].\n\nMulti-component oxide TFTs have also been intensively investigated to achieve an amorphous structure, high mobility (over 10 cm2/V.s), and low process temperatures (below 250 °C) since amorphous In–Ga–Zn–O (a-IGZO), grown by conventional vacuum processes, exhibit excellent physical and chemical properties and electrical performance. Results of solution processed oxide TFTs are summarized in Table 1. Lee et al. [93] explored a general route to realize printable high-mobility-oxide semiconductors at 600 °C, using ZnCl2, InCl2, and SnCl2 precursors dissolved in acetonitrile. The mobility values of bottom-gated TFTs with In–Zn–O (spin-coating)\nand In–Zn–Sn–O (ink-jet printing) were 16 and 7.4 cm2/V.s, respectively. Subsequently, many multi-component oxide TFTs fabricated by spin coating and ink-jet printing methods have been reported. Although many researchers have studied different precursors, oxide materials, and device structures, the performance of the resulting TFTs were not sufficient, and mobility values were far too low, to compete with conventional vacuum processes.\n\nVery recently, K. K Banger et al. [115] reported the formation of amorphous metal oxide semiconducting thin films (IZO and IGZO)\nusing a 'sol–gel on chip' hydrolysis approach from soluble metal alkoxide precursors, which resulted in an unprecedented high mobility of 10 cm2/V.s, reproducible and stable turn-on voltages Von ~ 0 V, and high operational stability at maximum process temperatures as low as 230 °C. Representative transfer curves of hydrolysed and dry-annealed IZO TFTs are shown in Fig. 13 (a)–(h). At lower temperatures, non-hydrolysed IZO samples such as in Fig. 13 (g)\nexhibit very poor TFT performance with low mobility N0.1 cm2/V.s and large hysteresis (35 V), indicative of significant charge trapping at\n\n![11_image_0.png](11_image_0.png)\n\nthe semiconductor/dielectric interface. In contrast, devices fabricated using the hydrolysed process (Fig. 13 (a)–(f)) exhibit high mobility, small hysteresis (<1.2 V) and small subthreshold slopes (< 0.5 V/\ndecade) at annealing temperatures as low as 230 °C. Therefore, it can be expected that this process may provide new opportunities for integrating amorphous oxide materials into functional electronic and optoelectronic devices.\n\nIn terms of practical industrial applications, Samsung Electronics have intensively studied solution processes and reported the first solution-processed oxide TFT panels in the form of a 2,2-inch mono-\nQQVGA (Quarter Quarter Video Graphic, 128 × 160) AMOLED with a bottom-emission structure [116]. Fig. 14 (a) shows an optical microscope image of a pixel array in which each pixel consists of two TFTs for switching and driving and one storage capacitor (2 transistor + 1 capacitor). The maximum process temperature was elevated to 350 °C\nin order to obtain proper TFT performance. Fig. 14 (b) clearly demonstrates that solution-processed oxide TFTs can successfully operate at display gray levels. After the successful fabrication of a 2.2-inch AMOLED panel, they demonstrated a 4-inch color QVGA (Quarter Video Graphic Array, 320 × 240 pixels) AMLCD panel and a monochrome 4-inch QVGA AMOLED panel [90]. Taiwan TFT LCD Association\n(TTLA)/Inpria Corp./Oregon State University also reported a 4.1-inch QVGA AM-LCD panel [117]. Toppan succeeded in fabricating high mobility (5.4 cm²/V.s) devices at a low temperature of 270 °C from a solution supplied by Evonik Industries and also fabricated 400 ppi\n(pixel per inch) VGA e-paper [ 118 ]. The development and selection of new precursors and the improvement of the semiconductor microstructure are important issues in solution-processed metal oxide thin film transistors; the ultimate goal is to achieve a combination of lowprocess temperature and high device performance (mobility and device stability) which is already available in microcrystalline silicon technology.\n\n## 4.2. Novel Electronic Applications\n\nSince the demonstration of an amorphous IGZO thin film transistor on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates [ 1 ], significant interest was ignited in high-end AMLCD and AMOLED technology because such devices are promising for high mobility, excellent uniformity in device parameters, and good scalability to large substrate areas. Particularly, several display companies have plunged into the development of oxide TFTs for demonstrating flexible and transparent flat panel displays. Toppan Printing Inc. reported 2-inch mono-color (80 × 60 pixels) and 4-inch full-color (QVGA) e-papers driven by a-IGZO TFTs on polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) plastic substrates as shown in Fig. 4 (a) and (b), respectively [ 119 ]. Sputterdeposited SiOxN, film was utilized as the gate insulator and passivation layer for bottom-gate InGaZnO TFTs. The µ FE , V th , and lon/off ratio values are 6 cm 2 /V.s, 1.6 V and >10 4 , respectively. This suggests a flexible electronic solution for the combination of an e-ink imaging film and a-IGZO TFTs. Samsung SDI Co. presented a 4.1-inch transparent Quarter Common Intermediate Format (QCIF) (176 ×\nRGB×220 pixels; 69 ppi) AMOLED display driven by a-IGZO TFTs as shown in Fig. 15: (c) mono-color and (d) full-color. In order to\n\n![11_image_1.png](11_image_1.png)\n\nemphasize the transparency of a-IGZO TFTs, both top and bottom emitting transparent OLED structures were adopted, indicating that the semi-transparent cathode and transparent anode were used in order to emit light in both directions. The transmittance of the AMOLED panel was higher than 20%. The μfe, Vth, subthreshold gate swing (S), and Ion/off ratio values are 14.8 cm2/V.s, 5.9 V, 0.59 V/\ndecade, and 5 × 106, respectively. Additionally, Park also reported a prototype transparent 2.5 inch AMOLED on a glass substrate, driven by ALD-deposited ZnO TFTs exhibiting reasonable device performance with a μfe of 4 cm2/V.s and Ion/off= 107 [12].\n\nLG Electronics Inc. realized a prototype of a 3.5 inch QCIF+\n(176 × 220 pixels) AMOLED display driven by a-IGZO TFTs, with pixels involving two transistors plus one capacitor on a stainless steel foil (panel thickness ~ 1 mm). Amorphous IGZO TFTs with top gate configuration and top emission OLED were employed and the fabricated TFTs exhibit a μFE= 6.7 cm2/V.s, S= 0.61 V/decade, and Ion/off ratio= 3.5 × 105 [120]. Although there are many ongoing efforts to realize flexible AMOLEDs, it still involves the use of thin glass and metal foil substrates, excluding polymer substrates. Indeed, the major limitation of polymer substrates comes from their poor surface quality, oxygen and moisture permeability, low glass transition temperature (Tg), and large coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE:\nSS (Stainless Steel) 304 (~17 ppm/K), non-alkali glass (~3 ppm/K), PET (~10 ppm/K, Tg ~78 °C)). However, as shown in Fig. 16 (a), Samsung Mobile Display [89] demonstrated a reasonable solution to realize flexible AMOLED on novel polyimide (PI) substrate, having a low CTE (3.4 ppm/K) and a high glass transition temperature (Tg\n~360 °C). They fabricated a 6.5-inch flexible full-color top-emission AMOLED on a PI substrate driven by a-IGZO TFTs. The a-IGZO TFTs exhibited a μFE of 15.1 cm2/V.s, S= 0.25 V/decade, and Vth= 0.9 V.\n\nRemarkably, they proved that the key issue of mechanical deformation with TFT backplanes is the fact that inorganic films and TFTs on flexible substrates undergo mechanical stress damage upon continuous deformation. As depicted in Fig. 16 (b), TFT samples on a 10 μm thick PI substrate withstood bending down to R (radius of curvature)= 3 mm under tension and compression without performance degradation. This indicated that TFT backplanes on sufficiently thin flexible substrates can be safely bent to smaller curvatures.\n\nRecently, the electrical information storage ability of devices with wide band gap ZnO-based materials has been intensively explored in view of nonvolatile memory (NVM) applications [121–124]. A NVM device that can be embedded into next generation large-area electronic systems is a promising component for the realization of low-cost and high-functionality consumer electronics. Several types of NVM structures, such as ferroelectronic films, resistive films, or a conventional sandwich gate insulator structure of the floating gate type or charge trap type, have been introduced in various forms of TFT devices that use different methods for information storage [125–127]. Fig. 17 (a) and (b) are representative NVM results that adopt a conventional sandwich gate insulator structure and ferroelectronic film, respectively. H. Yin et al.\n\n[125] reported a fully transparent NVM structure, operated by a-IGZO TFTs while being combined with various metal-oxide materials such as Al2O3, IGZO, and Al2O3 as the electron charge's tunneling, storage, and blocking layers, respectively. Typical transfer curves of the a-IGZO\nTFT NVM in program and erase modes without post-annealing are shown in Fig. 17 (a). Clear positive and negative shifting of the transfer curves due to channel hot electron injection in the program mode and one type of band-to-band tunneling-induced hot hole injection erase mode are observed. B. H. Kim et al. [126] reported a new ferroelectric memory array, driven by a-IGZO TFTs on a glass substrate, composed of two normal a-IGZO TFTs and a ferroelectric TFT (FeTFT). Poly\n(vinylidenefluoride–trifluoroethylene) [P(VDF–TrFE)] was employed as the gate dielectric layer of the FeTFT. Fig. 17 (b) shows the transfer characteristics of the fabricated FeTFT, measured by sweeping VG from negative to positive values and then from positive to negative values\n(double-sweep mode). In fact, dynamic properties of oxide TFTs are as important as static properties for applications of TFTs in active matrix electronics.\n\nThere are many reports on dynamic circuits based on a-IGZO\nTFTs on glass substrates [89,128,129]. Interestingly, a few circuits, fabricated with a-IGZO TFTs, were also demonstrated on flexible\n\n![12_image_0.png](12_image_0.png)\n\ncircuits implemented with a-IGZO TFTs were fabricated on PI/PET\nplastic substrates. The representative transfer curves on plastic exhibit a saturation mobility of 19 cm2/V.s and an S value of ~0.14 V/decade in Fig. 18 (a). Fig. 18 (b), (c), and (d) are a schematic diagram, an optical image, and an output waveform of a fabricated ring oscillator, respectively. For an input signal of 20 V, an 11-stage ring oscillator operates at 94.8 KHz with a propagation delay time of 0.48 μs, only two times slower than the fastest oxide TFT-based ring oscillators on glass substrates.\n\n## 5. Summary\n\nTo summarize, oxide semiconductor TFTs have progressed marvelously as promising electronic devices within an extremely short time. Several companies such as Samsung Electronics, Samsung Mobile Display, and LG Display have already demonstrated many prototypes of AMLCD and AMOLED panels that integrate oxide TFT\nbackplanes; this shows that such products are not far from being part of our daily life. In addition, novel applications such as transparent and flexible electronics are being explored intensively by several research groups. The field of oxide TFT research will remain a subject of intensive studies, as their superior device properties and relatively low fabrication cost are attractive for application in high-end electronics and/or large-scale ubiquitous markets.\n\nHowever, further issues must be considered and/or solved to step forward toward mass-production. Fundamental research involves the understanding of the density of states and defect levels in ionic semiconductor compounds, which will lead to a more thorough understanding on the mechanisms that govern device stability.\n\nAnother issue concerns the development of standard process schemes for mass-production. The electrical performance and stability of the oxide TFT devices have to be reproducible, meeting very rigorous criteria. The present review has thus provided much information on how the device structure, selection of materials, and process conditions may influence the oxide semiconductor TFT device properties. Although many researchers have contributed to the improvement of electrical performance and device stability based on different structures, process methods, and materials to date, several restrictions exist with regard to mass production; thus a meticulous selection of materials and process is necessary.\n\nSolution-based processes and novel applications will also be seriously considered in future research. The achievement of a lowtemperature process and reasonable device reliability will be critical to whether this technology survives or not.\n\nDespite the above issues, oxide semiconductor TFTs are anticipated to provide solutions to overcome many obstacles and limitations of conventional Si technology, and will without doubt become the leading technology in the near future.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThe present research was conducted under the research funding of Dankook University in 2010.\n\n## References\n\n[1] K.

AOSs represented by amorphous In–Ga–Zn–O (a-IGZO) are expected to be the channel material of TFTs in next-generation flat-panel displays because a-IGZO TFTs satisfy almost all the requirements for organic light-emitting-diode displays, large and fast liquid crystal and three-dimensional (3D) displays, which cannot be satisfied using conventional silicon and organic TFTs. The major insights of this review are summarized as follows. (i) Most device issues, such as uniformity, long-term stability against bias stress and TFT performance, are solved for a-IGZO TFTs.\n\n(ii) A sixth-generation (6G) process is demonstrated for 3200 and 3700 displays. (iii) An 8G\nsputtering apparatus and a sputtering target have been developed. (iv) The important effect of deep subgap states on illumination instability is revealed. (v) Illumination instability under negative bias has been intensively studied, and some mechanisms are proposed.\n\n(vi) Degradation mechanisms are classified into back-channel effects, the creation of traps at an interface and in the gate insulator, and the creation of donor states in annealed a-IGZO\nTFTs by the Joule heating; the creation of bulk defects should also be considered in the case of unannealed a-IGZO TFTs. (vii) Dense passivation layers improve the stability and photoresponse and are necessary for practical applications. (viii) Sufficient knowledge of electronic structures and electron transport in a-IGZO has been accumulated to construct device simulation models. Keywords: amorphous oxide semiconductor, thin-film transistor, liquid crystal display, organic light-emitting diode display, mobility, stability, mass production\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nSince our report in November 2004 on transparent and flexible thin-film transistors (TFTs) using amorphous In–Ga–Zn–O (a-IGZO), a representative amorphous oxide semiconductor\n(AOS) (figure 1) [1], several display companies have joined the development of this type of TFTs and have demonstrated various flat-panel displays (FPDs) including electronic papers (e-papers), organic light-emitting-diode displays (OLEDs)\nand liquid crystal displays (LCDs). The largest panel sizes of prototype displays reached 1900 for OLEDs [2] and 3700 for LCDs [3] as of early 2010.\n\nIn this paper, we review the present status of AOS\nincluding their applications to FPDs and integrated circuits as well as their fundamental material science. Since we have attempted to minimize the overlap of content with preceding review papers, further details can be found in the following references. Reference [4] is for general readers and [5]\n1468-6996/10/044305+23$30.00 1 © 2010 National Institute for Materials Science Printed in the UK\n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)\n\ncontains more scientific and technical data as well as reference papers. More review papers are contained in a special issue of J. Disp. Technol. on transparent electronics [6].\n\nThe first part of this review was written with general readers in mind and will concentrate on the background and present status of oxide electronics, focusing on TFT technology. The second part overviews recent reports on scientific and technical issues related to AOS materials and their TFT characteristics, particularly focusing on a-IGZO.\n\n## 2. Discovery Of Aoss\n\nFPDs and light-emitting diodes (LEDs), used in common electronic devices such as computers, were traditionally fabricated using conventional semiconductors such as Si, GaAs, InP and GaN. This situation changed in the late 1990 s because of intensive research on oxide conductors such as ZnO [7] for their application as active layers in semiconductor devices. A series of advances have been reported for ZnO, particularly in terms of film growth technology [8], its application in devices such as LEDs [9, 10]\nand the elucidation of its intrinsic properties [11], which led to demonstrations of mesoscopic effects in ZnO heterojunction systems [12] and proved that oxides can compete with conventional semiconductors (see [13] for a review).\n\nThe applications of polycrystalline ZnO (poly-ZnO) to TFTs have also been studied because poly-ZnO is known to act as an active layer in a semiconductor device even when fabricated at low temperatures below 300 ◦C. Therefore, ZnO is expected to replace hydrogenated amorphous silicon\n(a-Si:H), which is used in current FPDs. The first report on a ZnO TFT, which was fabricated in a single crystal, was published in 1968 [14], following the first proposal of a TFT fabricated using CdS in 1962 [15] and reports on TFTs fabricated using other oxides (SnO2, In2O3) [16, 17]. After a long incubation period, ZnO TFT research was revisited with many papers appearing since 2003. It is recognized that poly-ZnO TFTs still have many issues to be addressed, such as their low mobility of charge carriers and unstable electrical properties, which are largely due to grain boundaries. Another problem is the difficulty of microfabrication, which originates from their low chemical durability against acidic etchants and reducing atmospheres. There have recently been a significant improvements in these areas, and FPDs using ZnO TFT\narray backplanes have been demonstrated in active-matrix (AM)-LCDs by Kochi University of Technology [18, 19]\nand in transparent AM-OLEDs by the Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI) and LG\nElectronics (LGE) group [20, 21].\n\nWe have investigated AOSs since the mid-1990 s but from the viewpoint of fundamental materials research rather than semiconductor devices. The main objective of our research has always been to develop new functional oxide/inorganic materials, and the discovery of electrically conducting materials among amorphous oxides was a challenging topic.\n\nUntil then, only a few amorphous oxide conductors had been suggested such as InOx [22] and Sn-doped In2O3 (indium tin oxide, ITO) [23], but their structures and properties were poorly characterized. We developed a materials design concept for amorphous oxide conductors and published it in 1996 [24]. We expected that the delocalized s orbitals of heavy\n\n| Sci. Technol. Adv.

This hypothesis was proven to be correct, and many amorphous oxide conductors have since been found such as AgSbO3\n[25], 2CdO·GeO2 [26],\n2CdO·PbO [27], CdS·In2Sx [28] and InGaO3(ZnO)m (m 6 4)\n[29]. These materials were targeted for use as transparent conductive oxides and designed to have high electron density, electrical conductivity and optical transmittance.\n\nThis situation changed owing to the increasing interest in flexible electronic devices. The development of the flexible electronics was mainly driven by organic semiconductors until early 2000s, and ZnO research followed this trend. We considered the advantages and disadvantages of ZnO\nand organic semiconductors to be as follows. The main advantage common to these materials is that they can produce semiconductor devices as active layers even if they are deposited at low temperatures of markedly below 300 ◦C, whereas their main disadvantage is the instability and nonuniformity of properties due to grain boundaries. Another issue relevant to all these materials is the alteration of their electrical properties upon adsorption and desorption of trace amounts of oxygen and water. Another serious problem of ZnO and other oxide semiconductors, particularly for TFT use, is their high concentration of residual free electrons\n(>1017 cm−3) due to native defects such as zinc interstitials and oxygen vacancies. Consequently, it has been difficult to control the threshold voltage and to fabricate normally-off TFTs using poly-ZnO channels. To solve this problem, we employed a high-quality single-crystalline channel layer of InGaZnO4 (sc-IGZO) and demonstrated that the sc-IGZO\nlayer does not generate a high density of residual carriers, resulting in normally-off TFTs [30]. Similarly to sc-IGZO, we found that it was difficult to dope a high density of electrons into some amorphous oxides; for instance, we had to use proton implantation to dope 2CdO · GeO2 [26]. This in turn means that the free-electron density can be stably controlled down to markedly below 1015 cm−3 using such materials including amorphous InGaO3(ZnO)m. An important advantage of amorphous materials is that they do not suffer from the grain boundary problems typical for poly-ZnO. Using these advantages, we started research on TFTs with a-IGZO channels in 2003 and reported our first results in late 2004 [1]; we demonstrated the room-temperature fabrication of transparent, flexible TFTs on polyethylene terephthalate\n(PET) substrates by pulsed laser deposition (figure 1). The amorphous oxides used for active layers in semiconductor devices are now known as amorphous oxide semiconductors\n(AOSs).\n\n## 3. Advantages Of Aoss 3\n\nAs explained in the Introduction, AOSs including a-IGZO\nare promising channel materials for TFT backplanes in FPDs because of the following features (see table 1 for a comparison with Si TFTs). AOS TFTs are compatible with the present FPD industry, which uses large inexpensive glass substrates, because they are fabricated at low temperatures below 400 ◦C\nor even at room temperature. This is the main reason why a-Si:H TFTs are used in FPDs—a-Si:H films are deposited at temperatures below 350 ◦C using plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition and SiH4 gas. However, a-Si:H has many problems such as low mobility (<1 cm2 V\n−1s\n−1), instability under illumination (the Staebler-Wronski effect [31–33]) and electrical bias stress.\n\nThe mobility is improved to above 10 cm2 V\n−1s\n−1 by employing an AOS. The problem of instability was also the main concern regarding the mass production of AOSs, but recent studies have proved that the stability of a-IGZO\nTFTs is much greater than that of a-Si:H and organic TFTs and is comparable to that of polycrystalline silicon\n(poly-Si) TFTs. Poly-Si TFTs have well-known advantages over a-Si:H and organic TFTs, such as a high carrier mobility which can exceed 100 cm2 V\n−1s\n−1and excellent stability. It is also possible to fabricate poly-Si devices on inexpensive glass substrates by excimer laser annealing (such materials are called low-temperature poly-Si (LTPS)).\n\nHowever, the main drawback of poly-Si TFTs is their unacceptable variation of electrical properties due to grain boundary problems (short-range nonuniformity) [34, 35]\n\n![4_image_0.png](4_image_0.png)\n\nand inhomogeneous laser crystallization over a large area\n(long-range nonuniformity).\n\nThese drawbacks—the low mobility and instability of a-Si:H TFTs and the poor uniformity of poly-Si TFTs—have not been critical for AM-LCDs because a low mobility of ∼0.5 cm2 V\n−1s\n−1is sufficient for driving the present AM-LCDs of less than 90 inches diagonal size, and the instability and nonuniformity are compensated by LCD driver circuits. However, OLEDs require high mobilities because OLED pixels emit light by electrical current injection (i.e. an OLED is a current-driving device) and TFTs must support high currents. In addition, even a small distribution or fluctuation of TFT parameters, such as threshold voltage (Vth),\nresults in an unacceptable difference in the brightness of OLED pixels, causing a serious *mura* problem. For example, Jeong *et al* [36] reported that a variation in Vth of only ±0.1 V\nchanges the OLED luminance by 16%. Therefore, the OLED\ndisplays using a-Si:H, poly-Si and organic TFTs reported to date must employ complex compensation circuits having four or more TFTs (e.g. 4T2C and 5T2C circuits as listed in table 1; 4T2C means that the circuit involves four transistors and two capacitors). It is believed that such TFTs will not be used in the future mass production of OLED displays.\n\nHowever, the situation is changing rapidly even for AM-LCDs. It has been reported that the low-mobility a-Si:H TFTs cannot drive larger LCDs (e.g. 55 inches) operating at high frame rates above 120 Hz [37, 38]; the required mobility will be even higher for displays with higher resolution, a faster frame rate and a larger panel size (figure 2). Recently, three-dimensional (3D) displays have appeared on the market with panel sizes of ∼55 inches and frame rates of 240 Hz.\n\nHowever, higher frame rates of e.g. 480 Hz are required to improve the picture quality because a 3D display must project two or more picture frames alternately for the left and right eyes.\n\nFor these reasons, new channel materials are desired, and AOSs are expected to be one such material because they comply with all the above requirements. In particular, (i) they have high mobilities compatible with OLEDs, large LCDs and high-frame-rate 3D displays, (ii) they are compatible with large glass substrates (low-temperature fabrication) and present FPD technology, (iii) they have excellent uniformity owing to their amorphous structure and (iv) they are much more stable than a-Si:H and organic TFTs. AOS TFTs have other advantages such as the absence of a short-channel effect in small transistors [39] and the absence of the kink effect observed in crystalline silicon transistors.\n\n## 4. Present Status Of Displays And Circuits Based On Aos Tfts 4.1. Flat-Panel Displays\n\nThe development history of a-IGZO FPDs up to 2008 is summarized in [4] and more recent data are included in figures 3 and 4. As mentioned above, the first AOS TFT was reported in late 2004. Development research began in 2004 and Toppan Printing Co. Ltd first reported an AM display using AOS TFTs in the form of a flexible black-and-white e-paper in 2005 [40]. LGE has collaborated with ETRI on oxide TFTs and focused mainly on ZnO TFTs [20, 21].\n\nAfter that, LGE started working on AOSs, and reported the first AM-OLED display in 2006 [41]. Following them, Samsung SDI and Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology\n(SAIT) reported AM-OLED displays in mid-2007 [42, 43].\n\nThe largest displays by the end of 2008 were a 12.1 00 AM-OLED [44, 45] and a 1500 AM-LCD operating at 240 Hz with integrated gate drivers, as reported at the Society for Information Display (SID) meeting [46].\n\nFrom late 2008, more companies started activities involving AOSs. Hitachi Ltd, reported the low-voltage operation of AOS TFTs [47]. AU Optronics Corp. (AUO)\nstarted AOS TFT research in 2008 [48] and displayed a 2.4 00\n\n 11  \n\n![5_image_0.png](5_image_0.png)\n\n| size of and the original resolution without 'Q'. For example, QVGA has a resolution of 320 × 240 and QQVGA has that of 160 × 120. CIF 352 × 288 XGA 1024 × 768 QCIF+ 176 × 220 SXGA 1280 × 1024 (W)VGA (800)640 × 480 UXGA 1600 × 1200 SVGA 800 × 600 FHD 1920 × 1080 WQVGA 160 × 272 WXGA 1280 × 720/768/800   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n\nQVGA (see table 2 for the abbreviations of the resolutions)\nAM-OLED at FPD International (FPDI) 2009, where a 1900 QFHD AM-OLED was reported by Samsung Mobile Display Co. Ltd (SMD) [49] and a 1700 SXGA AM-LCD\nby Samsung LCD. LG Display (LGD) reported a 6.4 00 VGA\nAM-LCD, which was produced using a four-mask process similar to that used for a-Si:H LCD panels at FPDI2009, demonstrating that the production cost of AOS-based FPDs can be comparable to or even lower than those of present a-Si:H devices. Semiconductor Energy Laboratory (SEL)\ndemonstrated source/gate driver integration in a 400 QVGA\nAM-LCD [50, 51] and an AM-OLED [52]. Source/gate drive-integrated AM-LCDs were also reported by Sharp Corp. in the form of a 12.1 00 WXGA AM-LCD [53]. The largest FPD\ndriven by oxide TFTs was a 3700 FHD AM-LCD presented by AUO at TAOS2010 [3]. At the same conference, LGD\nreported a 1500 FHD AM-OLED [54].\n\n## 4.2. Flexible Displays\n\nFlexible displays have also been reported by several companies. The first reported display was the black-and-white e-paper by Toppan [40]. They have since developed more sophisticated displays such as a black-and-white e-paper with a larger size of 5.3500 for a 150 ppi (pixel per inch) resolution and a 200 black-and-white e-paper with the world's highest resolution of 400 ppi [55]. The first flexible FPD was an AM-OLED (3.5 00, QCIF+) fabricated on stainless steel foil presented by LGE [56]. SMD reported a very flexible 6.5 00 WQVGA AM-OLED fabricated on a polyimide substrate, which is bendable up to a curvature radius of 2 cm [57]. Dai Nippon Printing Co. Ltd also reported a flexible 4.7 00 QVGA\nAM-OLED on stainless steel, which combines a white OLED and a flexible color filter array on a polyethylene naphthalene sheet [58].\n\n## 4.3. Transparent Displays\n\nAnother interesting application is transparent electronic devices. Toppan proposed an attractive idea that utilizes the transparency of AOS TFTs [59]. In conventional color AM\ne-papers and displays, a color filter array is formed on the front plane and a TFT array is formed on the back plane.\n\nTherefore, the fine alignment of these planes through liquid crystal or E-Ink microcapsules is necessary to avoid color misfit. However, the thickness of a liquid crystal is only 4–6µm, while that of the E-Ink microcapsules is much larger (40–50µm), which hinders the horizontal alignment. This problem is critical for flexible displays because bending the display inevitably causes misalignment of the components on the front and back planes. Toppan solved this problem by fabricating a transparent TFT array on a color filter array and integrating them into the front plane. This structure can minimize the optical transmission/reflection loss owing to the transparency of the a-IGZO TFTs.\n\nAn important application of this is expected to be in transparent displays. DENSO demonstrated a transparent\n\n![6_image_0.png](6_image_0.png)\n\nmonocolor passive-matrix inorganic display at FPDI2006. Toppan presented a dual-sided black-and-white display at FPDI2009. Moreover, several companies have developed transparent OLED displays. For example, LGD presented a transparent AM-OLED display having an aperture ratio of ∼30% at FPDI2009 (they claim a ∼65% aperture ratio for passive-matrix OLED), partly because they employed opaque LTPS TFT arrays. Samsung SDI reported a 4.1 00 transparent dual-emission QCIF AM-OLED using a-IGZO\nTFTs [60], but its transparency was only ∼20%. LGE and ETRI have developed 2.5 00 QCIF+ transparent OLED displays using ZnO TFT backplanes with a panel transmittance of 60% [20, 21], and they displayed a 1.5 00 QQVGA transparent AM-OLED driven by AOS TFTs with a transparency of 45% at IMID2009. Transparent displays became a hot topic at SID2010; Samsung LCD displayed a 4600 transparent LCD\ndriven by a-Si:H TFTs with an integrated touch panel and LGD presented a 4700 window TV at the exhibition. At the SID2010 conference, SMD presented a 14.1 00 transparent OLED driven by LTPS TFTs with a transparency of up to 38% [61], and AUO featured a 2.4 00 transparent OLED driven by a-IGZO TFTs with an integrated touch panel [62].\n\n## 4.4. System Integration\n\nOne of the main advantages of AOS TFTs is their high carrier mobility. This advantage is exploited in more sophisticated glass-based devices known as 'system-on-glass (SOG)' or\n'system-on-panel (SOP)' devices. In these devices, electronic circuits such as pixel drivers and other peripheral circuits are integrated with TFT arrays on the same glass substrate. SEC\nfirst demonstrated a gate driver-integrated 1500 AM-LCD [46]. SEL integrated source and drain drivers in a 400 QVGA\nAM-LCD [50] and an AM-OLED [51]. More recently, Sharp reported a source/driver-integrated 12.1 00 AM-LCD [53].\n\nTransparent and flexible nonvolatile memories have also been developed by several groups using a-IGZO as active layers [63–65]. These memories are expected to be integrated in AOS-based SOPs.\n\n6\n\n![6_image_1.png](6_image_1.png)\n\nLarge-area fabrication techniques are required for the mass production of FPDs. Although the first AOS TFT was fabricated by pulsed laser deposition, Canon later demonstrated the fabrication of a-IGZO TFTs by radio-frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering [66]. Nowadays, most displays and AOS TFTs are fabricated by RF/dc sputtering. Some companies have attempted to develop large-size sputtering systems. For example, Oregon State University (OSU) and Applied Materials (AMAT) have been collaborating to develop metal-oxide TFTs since 2008 [67], and AKT announced a sputtering system for a 2200 × 2500 mm2 glass substrate at FPDI2007 (designed mainly for ITO). SEL reported a 3.4 00 QHD 326 ppi AM-OLED display based on a-IGZO TFTs and fabricated by a 3.5th-generation (3.5G) process (0.6 × 0.72 m2; see table 3 for the glass size of different LCD process generations) [68]. AUO uses a 6G sputtering target, which was used to produce the 3700 [3] and 3200 AM-LCDs [48]. More recently, ULVAC\nInc. reported the good uniformity of a-IGZO TFTs over a G4 size (0.73 × 0.92 m2area) using a multicathode ac sputtering system (figure 5(a)) [69], and they also developed an 8G-size a-IGZO sputtering target (figure 5(b)). Target manufactures, such as Nippon Mining & Metals Co. Ltd, provide sputtering\n\n 11  \n\n| Table 4.

The current a-Si:H\nLCDs employ 4–5 masks (table 4). One mask step can be eliminated by using a gray mask (also called a half-tone mask)\nto pattern the source/drain electrodes and the channel in a single masking step. LGD presented a 6.4 00 VGA a-IGZO\nAM-LCD fabricated with a 4-mask process at FPDI2009, and AUO has developed a 5-mask process [71]. SMD presented a 7-mask process (table 4) [2, 72], but it was designed for an AM-OLED with an etch-stopper structure and is essentially similar to a-Si:H processes (table 1).\n\nA future critical issue is the material of bus-line electrodes. A-Si:H TFTs have used tough metals with high melting points such as Ta, Cr and Mo/Ta.\n\nLarge, high-resolution and fast-frame-rate panels require higher-conducting electrodes such as Al and Cu. However, Al has poor adhesion to glass and Cu easily diffuses by electromigration as is well known in silicon ultra-large-scale integrated circuit (ULSI) technology. SEC applied Cu-based bus lines to a 1500 AMLCD [46] and AUO applied Ti/Al/Ti electrodes to 3700 AMLCD [3], in which the Ti layers improve the adhesion of the Al layer. In the case of using Cu electrodes, a group from Tohoku University examined a Cu–Mn alloy for a-IGZO TFTs and found that a self-forming MnOx layer acts as a good passivation and diffusion barrier [73]. Toppan also studied Al and Mo bus lines for e-papers because e-papers larger than 1000 will require a thick ITO layer (above 1µm) [74].\n\n4.6. Solution and printing processes Other future issues are solution processes and printing technologies. These issues are thought to be the largest drawback of AOS TFTs compared with organic TFTs because, in general, oxide materials have high melting points and require high synthesis temperatures. Despite this, solution processes have been intensively studied and improved as summarized in table 5. The pioneer of this field is the HP and OSU group, who fabricated amorphous In–Zn–O (a-IZO) TFTs from halide precursors and obtained high mobilities of 16.1 cm2 V\n−1s\n−1for spin-coated TFTs and 7.4 cm2 V\n−1s\n−1for printed TFTs, however, these TFTs required a rather high annealing temperature of 400 ◦C [75].\n\nSAIT has intensively studied solution processes [76] and reported the first solution-processed oxide TFT panels in the form of a 2.2 00 QQVGA AM-OLED, a 400 color QVGA\nLCD [77] and a single-color 400 QVGA AM-OLED [78].\n\nTaiwan TFT LCD Association (TTLA)/Inpria Corp./OSU\nalso reported a 4.1 00 QVGA AM-LCD [79]. They chose amorphous In–Zn–O (a-IZO) because the solution process becomes rather complex for multicomponent materials such as a-IGZO. Toppan succeeded in fabricating a high-mobility\n(5.4 cm2 V\n−1s\n−1) AOS TFT at a rather low temperature of 270 ◦C from a solution supplied by Evonik Industries and also fabricated a 400 ppi VGA e-paper [74]. Lim *et al* [80]\nreported solution-processed a-IGZO TFTs and found that their a-IGZO films contained fine microstructures including pores. The development and selection of new precursors and the improvement of microstructure are important current\n\n![8_image_0.png](8_image_0.png)\n\n## 4.7. Section Summary\n\nThe above activities indicate that AOS TFTs can be fabricated using very similar processes to those of present a-Si:H\ntechnology, and that the key technology steps, such as large-area sputtering targets and deposition systems, are being rapidly developed for their mass production. AUO announced at FINETECH JAPAN 2010 that they are ready to use a-IGZO\nTFTs for FPDs, and other companies also imply production of AOS-based FPDs.\n\n## 5. Operation Characteristics Of A-Igzo Tfts 5.1. Tft Structures And Fabrication Process\n\nHereafter, we overview the fundamental properties of a-IGZO and the operation characteristics of a-IGZO TFTs. Figure 6 illustrates typical device structures used for AOS TFTs. It is convenient to specify the TFT structure by the stacking order of the gate electrode, channel layer and source/drain electrodes (contacts) and to classify them into combinations of top/bottom gate and top/bottom contact. There is another structure called a co-planar structure in which source/drain contacts are formed in the same plane of the channel layer. This structure is employed for poly-Si TFTs and c-Si field-effect transistors (FETs), and its use has also recently been proposed for a-IGZO TFTs, as mentioned in section 5.5. The top-gate structure was employed for TFTs using epitaxial layers in which it is difficult to form a bottom electrode (e.g. c-InGaZnO4 FET [30]). This structure has other advantages. For example, it requires only two patterning mask steps at minimum, and the upper gate insulator and electrode act as passivation layers that protect the channel layer from degradation due to atmospheric exposure. Bottom-gate structures are common in laboratory research because commercially available SiO2/Si wafers can be used for the gate insulator and electrode, respectively, and TFT structures are easily formed by the deposition of a channel layer with a single mask step to form the source and drain electrodes (note that another mask step to make mesas of channel regions would be better employed to suppress the gate leakage current and prevent stray current, which often leads to the overestimation of TFT mobilities). This structure is, of course, not applicable to practical displays, and it has various disadvantages. For example, (i) the back-channel surface is exposed to the atmosphere, and therefore the TFT\ncharacteristics can be affected by the adsorption, desorption and diffusion of atmospheric gases, causing instability\n(section 5.8) and (ii) the gate—source/drain overlaps are very large and result in a large parasitic capacitance, which slows the response of devices and circuits. Both gate structures can employ either top-contact or bottom-contact structures. An advantage of the top-contact structure for oxide TFTs is that it can minimize the oxidation of the source/drain electrodes at the semiconductor channel interface, and geometrically accurate contacts can easily be formed. On the other hand, using a bottom-contact structure, more care is required to make good contacts with the upper channel layer, such as by forming taper-edge structures in the electrodes [66].\n\nInverted staggered structures have been employed in most prototype displays. One reason for this is that the same structures are used for a-Si:H TFTs. These structures employ bottom-gate and top-contact configurations, which are further classified by the structure above the channel layer. One is an etch-stopper structure, where an etching protection layer is formed before forming the source and drain; the latter are patterned by etching (as proposed for a-IGZO TFTs in [81]). The other is a channel-etch structure where a part of the channel layer is removed when the source and drain are formed by etching. The channel-etching procedure damages the back-channel surface and can cause the degradation of TFT characteristics; it also requires a thick channel to stop etching in the channel layer. The etch-stopper structure is free from these problems but requires an extra patterning mask. Both structures have been employed for the mass production of a-Si:H TFTs and are also used for AOS TFTs.\n\n 11  \n\n![9_image_0.png](9_image_0.png)\n\n## 5.2. Tft Characteristics: Mobility\n\nTFT characteristics are usually deduced from the output characteristics, where the source-to-drain current (IDS) is plotted against the source-to-drain voltage (VDS) for various gate-to-source voltages (VGS), and from the transfer characteristics, where IDS is plotted against VGS for various VDS, as shown in figure 7.\n\nDevice performance is evaluated in terms of several parameters as follows. On-current Ion is particularly important for current-driving devices such as OLEDs. However, Ion depends on the device geometry (i.e. channel width W, length L and thickness tc), the gate insulator material (i.e. dielectric constant εi and gate capacitance CG) and the applied voltages.\n\nTherefore, it is normalized into the field-effect (FE) mobility using an analytical equation based on the following gradual channel approximation (see [82–84] for the fundamental physics and analysis of TFTs and FETs):\n\n$$I_{\\rm DS}=\\frac{W}{L}\\mu C_{\\rm G}\\left[\\left(V_{\\rm GS}-V_{\\rm th}\\right)V_{\\rm DS}-\\frac{V_{\\rm DS}^{2}}{2}\\right].\\tag{1}$$\n\nHere, µ denotes the carrier mobility in the channel and Vth is a pseudo-constant called the threshold voltage. However, the observed IDS is usually lower than expected from equation (1)\nbecause defects in the channel, gate insulator and channel/gate insulator interface trap charge carriers. Therefore, the value of µ obtained from equation (1) and the experimental TFT\ncharacteristics is approximated as\n\n$$\\mu=\\frac{N_{\\mathrm{GS}}-N_{\\mathrm{t,tot}}}{N_{\\mathrm{GS}}}\\mu_{\\mathrm{d}}.$$\n$$\\left(2\\right)$$\n\nHere, µd denotes the drift mobility in the channel, NGS is the total carrier density induced by VGS estimated as NGS =\nCG(VGS–Vth) and Nt,tot denotes the density of carriers trapped by defects. The thus-obtained µ value is called the field-effect mobility µFE (more specifically, the TFT mobility) and is used to assess the TFT performance.\n\nDifferent values of µFE are obtained using different approximations as shown in figures 8(a)–(c), and it is important to check their consistency. Saturation mobility\n(µsat) is obtained from IDS in the saturation regime (i.e. when VDS is markedly above the pinch-off voltage Vp = VGS–Vth)\nunder the condition VDS  Vp using the following equation:\n\n$$I_{\\mathrm{DS}}^{1/2}=\\sqrt{\\frac{W}{2L}\\mu C_{\\mathrm{G}}\\left(V_{\\mathrm{GS}}-V_{\\mathrm{th}}\\right)}\\,.$$\n$$(3)$$\n\nThe values of µsat and Vth are deduced by plotting I\n1/2 DS\nversus VGS as shown in figure 8(a). Note that VDS must be larger than Vp and that there is a large deviation from linearity for low-VDS data. Even taking a large VDS of 10 V,\na slight nonlinearity remains and the deduced parameters vary with µsat = 8.2–12.6 cm2 V\n−1s\n−1and Vth = 0.48–0.93 V, as indicated by the red and blue lines in figure 8.\n\nAs explained above, field-effect mobility is a general term including µsat, while it is also used as a specific definition. In this case, µFE is obtained from transfer characteristics in the linear IDS–VGS region (i.e. at VDS ∼ 0  VGS) using the following equation:\n\n$$I_{\\mathrm{DS}}=\\frac{W}{L}\\mu C_{\\mathrm{G}}V_{\\mathrm{DS}}\\left(V_{\\mathrm{GS}}-V_{\\mathrm{th}}\\right).$$\n$$\\quad(4)$$\n\nThe values of µFE and Vth are obtained by plotting IDS versus VGS as shown in figure 8(b) (13.7 cm2 V\n−1s\n−1and 2.63 V,\nrespectively, using the red line). Note that VDS must be as small as possible (e.g.  0.1 V). Usually IDS–VGS curves are nonlinear; therefore, the value of µFE changes with VGS as shown in figure 8(c), and is represented by the maximum value\n(Note that only the data for VDS = 2 V (the thick line) can be used for evaluating µFE because VDS must be small).\n\n$$\\mu_{\\mathrm{FE}}(V_{\\mathrm{GS}})=g_{\\mathrm{m}}(V_{\\mathrm{GS}})\\frac{L}{W C_{\\mathrm{OX}}V_{\\mathrm{DS}}},$$\n$$({\\boldsymbol{5}})$$\n, (5)\nwhereas crystalline Si and a-Si:H TFTs exhibit a maximum in their µFE–VGS curves [85], µFE monotonically increases up to 18 cm2 V\n−1s\n−1for a-IGZO. This result can be interpreted as reduction of the apparent carrier mobility due to interface scattering in the high-field region in silicon, but not in an a-IGZO TFT fabricated on an atomically flat SiO2/c-Si substrate because the interface scattering is not significant.\n\nHowever, maxima in µFE–VGS curves are observed in other a-IGZO TFTs, for example, in an etch-stopper-type inverted staggered TFT on glass that exhibits a large µFE\n\n![10_image_0.png](10_image_0.png)\n\nof 35.8 cm2 V\n−1s\n−1[81]. The low values of µFE in the low-VGS region are caused by carrier trapping, as follows from equation (2).\n\nThe above analysis of a-IGZO TFT (figures 7 and 8)\nreveals that the two values of mobility, µsat and µFE, are consistent with each other and that the above equations are reliable for evaluating a-IGZO TFTs.\n\nFor practical applications, the off-current (Ioff) is also an important parameter because it determines the minimum power consumption of a device. Usually Ioff < 10−12 A is required for FPDs, and the a-IGZO TFT shown in figure 7(b)\nhas a much smaller value of ∼10−14 A. From the values of Ion and Ioff, the on-to-off current ratio Ron/off = Ion/Ioff is defined, which exceeds 109for an a-IGZO TFT. The origin of Ioff is discussed in section 5.7. 5.3. TFT characteristics: subthreshold voltage swing parameter S Another important TFT parameter is the subthreshold voltage swing (S value), which reflects the value of VGS required to obtain a 10 times larger IDS in the subthreshold region (i.e.\n\nVGS < Vth). It is defined as S = dVGS/d log10 IDS. The S value is also dependent on VGS as shown in figure 8(d), and usually the smallest value of S is taken.\n\nThe importance of the S value is that it determines the minimum VGS required to turn a TFT from the off state to the on state, roughly estimated as 1VGS,min = S × Ron/off.\n\na-IGZO TFTs have an S value of ∼100 meV decade−1, which is comparable to that of poly-Si TFTs; this is a reason why a-IGZO TFTs operate at rather small voltages (<5 V, see figure 7).\n\nThe S value also provides important information about the quality of a TFT. It is related to the trap density in the band gap (subgap traps) at the Fermi level (Dsg) as\n\n$$S=\\ln10\\cdot\\frac{k_{\\rm B}T}{e}\\left(1+\\frac{eD_{\\rm sg}}{C_{\\rm G}}\\right)$$ $$=59.5\\left(1+\\frac{eD_{\\rm sg}}{C_{\\rm G}}0\\right)[{\\rm meV\\;decade}^{-1}\\;{\\rm at\\;300\\;K}].\\tag{6}$$\n\nFrom this equation, the S value of a metal-insulatorsemiconductor (MIS)-type FET should be larger than 59.5 mV decade−1at 300 K and a steeper transfer curve should correspond to a higher-quality channel with fewer defects. The value of Dsg for the a-IGZO TFT described in figure 8(d) is ∼1011 cm−2eV−1. This Dsg value includes contributions from the bulk channel region Nsg and the interface Dit, and it is important to separate them to clarify the origin of the defects. A recent study reported that Dit =\n0.82 × 1011 cm−2eV−1and Nsg = 3.2 × 1016 cm−3eV−1for a TFT annealed in wet oxygen at 400 ◦C [86]. This is discussed in section 5.8 in relation to TFT stability.\n\n 11  \n\n![11_image_0.png](11_image_0.png)\n\n## 5.4. Comparison With A-Si:H Tft\n\nFigure 9 shows the characteristics of an a-Si:H TFT. There are several differences compared with the a-IGZO TFT graphs in figure 7. In particular, (i) Ion is 1000 times smaller at ∼10−6 A,\n(ii) the S value is much larger at ∼0.4 V decade−1, (iii) Ioff is smaller at 10−13 A but increases with decreasing VGS and\n(iv) the IDS–VDS curves are nonlinear even for small VDS. As explained above, Ion and S depend on the device dimensions and should be normalized, for example, into µFE and Dsg. The above analysis yields µsat = 0.24–0.60 cm2 V\n−1s\n−1, Vth =\n0.2–4 V and Dsg ∼ 1012 cm−2eV−1, that is, the FE mobilities are 10 times smaller and the defect density is 10 times larger in a-Si:H TFTs than in a-IGZO TFTs. These values reflect the low mobilities of a-Si:H (∼0.8 cm2 V\n−1s\n−1for electrons and ∼0.002 cm2 V\n−1s\n−1for holes [87]). Because of the low mobilities, the present a-Si:H technology is considered unsuitable for future displays, and owing to the large defect density, a-Si:H TFTs require relatively high operating voltages.\n\n## 5.5. Electrode Structures And Materials\n\nThe nonlinearity of the IDS–VDS curves of the a-Si:H TFT\nin figure 9(a) for small VDS is caused by the large contact resistance, mostly due to the series resistance between the top source/drain electrodes and the bottom channel region (the so-called current crowding effect [88]). Similar effects have also been observed for a-IGZO TFTs, for example, in the first sputtered a-IGZO TFT [66]. The current crowding effect is examined via the channel thickness dependence in reference [89].\n\nThe nonlinearity of the IDS–VDS curves is also affected by the source/drain material and by the contact structure. We analyzed the contact resistance of various channel materials with the transmission line model [90] and found that Ti and ITO are the best electrodes [91]. The contact resistance and interface electric characteristics strongly depend on the electronic structure and carrier density of the channel surface; therefore, several treatments have been employed to improve contacts, such as Ar plasma treatment [92] and the insertion of highly doped a-IZO or a-IGZO. A drawback of oxide semiconductors is that they are easily reduced by chemical and physical treatments, such as Ar or hydrogen plasma treatment or annealing in Ar or hydrogen, but this property can also be used in a sophisticated fabrication process for co-planar homojunction TFTs [93, 94] and self-aligned processes [95–97].\n\nIt should also be noted that multilayer electrode structures such as Ti/Au (i.e. Au on Ti) and Ti/Al/Ti [3] are also used for electrodes. The Au layer protects the bottom reactive metal and decreases the contact resistivity. The Ti layer not only improves the adhesion of the top layer but also reduces the resistivity of the contact with the channel.\n\n## 5.6. Subgap States And Mobility Model\n\nAs explained above, the S value reflects the density of subgap traps, and knowledge of this density (subgap DOS, Dsg(E))\nis important for improving the TFT characteristics. Figure 10 shows a schematic Dsg(E) for a-Si:H and a-IGZO; a-Si:H has tail states below the conduction band minimum (CBM) and above the valence band maximum (VBM), and their energy dependence follows the Urbach law as Dsg(E) ∝ exp (E/Eu)\n(Eu is called the Urbach energy). Different values of Eu are deduced by different methods, but typically Eu ∼ 25 meV for the conduction band tail and Eu ∼ 50 meV for the valence band tail in a-Si:H. For doped a-Si:H, donor and acceptor levels also appear, and their different charge states are labeled as D−/D\n0/D\n+in figure 10(a). A similar subgap DOS has been revealed for a-IGZO as shown in figure 10(b) [5], but there are some differences. As discussed above, S and Dsg are smaller in a-IGZO TFTs than in a-Si:H TFTs.\n\nReflecting this result, the subgap DOS measured by other methods such as device simulation (technology computerassisted design, TCAD) [98] and the capacitance–voltage\n(C–V) method [99] substantiated that the subgap DOS in a-IGZO is one-two orders of magnitude smaller than that in a-Si:H (figure 11(a)). The C–V analysis also shows that the hysteresis in the electrical characteristics of the unannealed a-IGZO TFT (figure 11(b)) is related to an extra subgap DOS at 0.1–0.3 eV below CBM, although this energy level would be too shallow to quantitatively explain the slow response time of the hysteresis (longer than tens of seconds).\n\nThe subgap DOS of a-IGZO varies for different a-IGZO\nTFTs. The larger DOS in a depletion-type TFT than in an enhancement-type TFT is explained by the larger density of donors, and thus of defect states, in the depletion-type TFT. The smaller DOS in an annealed TFT than in an\n\n![12_image_0.png](12_image_0.png)\n\nunannealed TFT indicates that the annealing in air at 400 ◦C\nreduces the defect density and also annihilates the shallow defects in the 0.1–0.3 eV range, removing the hysteresis as shown in figure 11(b). The subgap DOS is separated into the interface (Dit) and the bulk (Nsg) regions (figure 12(a)),\nwhich reveals that annealing decreases Dit from 4.8 × 1011 to 0.82 × 1011 cm−2eV−1cm−2eV−1and Nsg from 7.0 × 1016 to 3.2 × 1016 cm−3eV−1[86].\n\nThe subgap DOS of annealed a-IGZO TFTs is larger when deduced by device simulation than when deduced by the C–V method. This is because in the device simulation it is assumed that the electron mobility is constant and does not depend on carrier density, which is unrealistic as shown in figure 13(a) (the mechanism is discussed on the basis of the percolation conduction model in section 6.2, see figure 13(b)). In contrast, the C–V method does not require the assumption of the mobility model and can provide more reliable DOS data. Therefore, deducing an accurate subgap DOS and mobility model is still challenging [100]. Jeon and co-workers combined a photo-excited C–V method and device simulation and extracted the variation of effective mobility with VGS [101–104]. We also extracted the dependence of mobility on the electron density (Ne) using a combined field-effect method and found that a universal µ(Ne)\nmodel explains the different characteristics of a-IGZO TFTs subjected to different annealing treatments. The universal model follows the relation in the analytical percolation conduction model µ(Ne) = µ0 exp (−eφeff(Ne)/kBT ) [105]\nwith effective potential barrier height φeff(Ne) = φ 0 eff(Ne) −\na1 log Ne − a2 log2 Ne, where φ 0 eff(Ne) = φ0 − eσ 2 φ\n/(2kBT ) −\nEBM(Ne) is the effective barrier height measured from the Fermi level, and a1 and a2 are correction constants [106].\n\n## 5.7. Deep Subgap States: Off Current\n\nThe schematic electronic structure in figure 10(b) also shows an interesting structure above VBM. As observed in the hard x-ray photoemission spectrum (HX-PES) shown in figure 14(b), a-IGZO has a high density of occupied states above VBM with an energy width of ∼1.5 eV [107] (Note that the assignment of the valence band peaks is shown in figure 14(a), which will be compared with the density functional theory (DFT) calculation result in section 6.5). Much smaller but similar structures have also been reported in crystalline (Zn,Mg)O [108]. For a-IGZO, DFT calculations of oxygen-deficient a-IGZO suggest that a possible origin of these levels is an oxygen vacancy with a free space comparable to the size of an oxygen ion [109–111]. These deep states are important in understanding why a-IGZO TFTs do not exhibit an inversion operation, which is observed in\n\n![13_image_0.png](13_image_0.png)\n\n![13_image_1.png](13_image_1.png)\n\ncrystalline Si FETs and also in some a-Si:H TFTs as shown in figure 9(b).\n\nThe large band gap (∼3.2 eV) [107, 109, 110] and the strongly localized valence band in a-IGZO [110] cannot explain the flat Ioff at negative VGS in figure 7(b) because the standard MIS FET model predicts that holes are induced by the inversion of band bending at negative VGS markedly below the band-gap value. Therefore, one possible explanation for the low and flat Ioff is that the source/drain contacts form a strong Schottky contact for holes and block the hole current.\n\nThe device simulation in figure 15, based on the parameters and the subgap DOS model in [98], reveals that Ioff should\n\n![13_image_2.png](13_image_2.png)\n\nbe <10−20 A for an ideal TFT, which should be due to the Schottky contact for holes.\n\nHowever, it is difficult to believe that oxide semiconductors form a stable and good Schottky contact [112–114], because oxide semiconductor–metal contacts easily exhibit an ohmic behavior, which is explained by the formation of conductive layers by a reduction reaction [115]. As is known for poly-Si TFTs, direct contact between an electrode and a channel results in a strong electric field at the interface and causes a leakage current due to tunneling, hot electron injection and generationrecombination current by the Shockley–Reed–Hall (SRH)\nmechanism; therefore, a lightly doped drain structure is employed. A similar mechanism should apply to a-IGZO TFTs; although the band gap is much larger for a-IGZO, the SRH mechanism can still be efficient owing to the surface reduction layer having a high density of defect states.\n\nThe deep-subgap DOS above VBM in figure 14(b)\nprovides another possible explanation of the low Ioff. The subgap DOS extends up to ∼1.5 eV above VBM, and its density exceeds 1020 cm−3even for high-quality, weakly doped a-IGZO films [116]. This density is larger than the electron density that can be induced by VGS (<1018 cm−3),\nas estimated from the relation Ne ∼ CG · VGS/e based on the TFT dimensions in figure 7. In such a case, the Fermi level is pinned in the subgap DOS and thus there should be no mobile holes in the valence band. According to a recent angle-resolved hard x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (AR-HX-PES) study, the deep part of the DOS is mostly concentrated in the surface region [116], but it still remains a possible origin of the pinning centers because the detection limit of HX-PES is above 1019 cm−3, and such a density is still sufficiently high to pin the Fermi level in conventional TFT structures.\n\nFigure 14(b) shows the peak structure around the Fermi energy EF, suggesting that a high density of electrons exists near the conduction band. Similar structures have been reported in highly doped a-IZO [117] and can be attributed to doped electrons. We estimate the corresponding densities to be >5 × 1019, but these values are larger than the carrier density that can be induced by VGS and cannot be achieved in TFTs. The AR-HX-PES results showed no systematic relationship between the shallow DOS and the electron density measured using the Hall effect [116].\n\n## 5.8. Stability\n\nThe long-term stability and reliability of TFTs are the most important issues for their mass production. The stability of AOS TFTs has been intensively studied in recent years.\n\nAs mentioned above, a-IGZO TFTs have high mobilities of above 10 cm2 V\n−1s\n−1even when fabricated at room temperature; however, the uniformity and stability are poor for unannealed TFTs [118, 119]. Therefore, most a-IGZO TFTs in prototype displays have been annealed at a temperature above 300 ◦C (lower annealing temperatures have been applied recently). We reported that such high-temperature annealing is necessary to oxidize a-IGZO and reduce the concentration of native donor defects in as-deposited a-IGZO,\neven in a pure O2 atmosphere; electrical conductivity increases with annealing temperature up to ∼300 ◦C and then starts decreasing [118]. This result indicates that O2 molecules do not have sufficient oxidizing power to passivate the defects in a-IGZO below 300 ◦C. We also found that annealing is more effective in wet oxygen than in dry oxygen, which was attributed to the stronger oxidation power provided by H2O\nmolecules. Thermal annealing removes weak chemical bonds, 11  \nparticularly Zn–O-related bonds, and forms stable a-IGZO. Constant-current stress tests revealed that annealed a-IGZO TFTs are much more stable than unannealed TFTs with the saturation values of the Vth shift (1Vth) less than 2 V [119].\n\nSome groups, including ours, have reported that the time dependence of 1Vth follows a stretched exponential law [120, 121]. Most results of 1Vth under bias stress tests exhibit a positive shift, which is explained by the following contributions: the trapping of positive charges in (i) the gate insulator, (ii) the channel-gate insulator interface, (iii) the bulk of the channel and (iv) the back-channel surface, as well as (v) the creation of acceptor-type deep traps (i.e. unoccupied defects that can accept extra electrons) and (vi) a decrease in the donor concentration. Contribution (vi) can be ruled out because it is difficult to believe that the defect density can decrease during a degradation test. Regarding to our studies [86, 119], contribution (i) can also be excluded because we used stable thermally oxidized SiO2 formed on a Si wafer. But this mechanism is valid for other practical device structures that employ SiO2, SiON or SiNx gate insulators and are not formed by high-temperature oxidation of single-crystalline silicon.\n\nThere have been reports of other 1Vth(t) dependences.\n\nAn exponential dependence of 1Vth(t) has been reported for a constant–voltage stress test and explained by charge tunneling [122]. It is pointed out that most of the instability of bottom-gate a-IGZO TFTs with the back-channel surface exposed to the atmosphere originates from the adsorption/ desorption of oxygen and water molecules [123, 124]; they proposed a field-induced adsorption/desorption model [125].\n\nThe instability due to the exposed back channel is solved by adopting dense, gas-tight passivation layers (see, for example, [126]) and employing a top-gate structure in which the gates act as passivation layers [127]. Actually, most of the recent a-IGZO TFTs have employed passivation layers made of SiO2 [128], SiNx [93], Al2O3 [129, 130]\nor TiOx [3, 131]. It has also been found that the transfer characteristics of annealed a-IGZO TFTs under bias stress tests only exhibit parallel shifts; i.e. the values of S and mobility are not affected. This behavior is explained by the formation of deep traps, which reduce the density of free electrons in the channel.\n\nWe reported that this situation is different for unannealed TFTs fabricated at room temperature, which also exhibit the degradation of S values, and that the increase in the subgap DOS near CBM must also be considered [119]. This degradation is recovered by aging at room temperature in air for over 10 h [132]. We also observed that only applying negative-bias stress does not change Vth. The instability against positive bias stress discussed above and the high stability against negative-bias stress suggest that the positive-bias instability is related to the current flow. Uraoka and co-workers observed Joule heating by the drain current in a-IGZO TFTs and concluded that a positive 1Vth is induced by the gate voltage and that a negative 1Vth is induced by the drain voltage and is caused by the Joule heating [133].\n\nJeong *et al* [36] gave a good overview of the instability issues reflected in the above description.\n\n![15_image_0.png](15_image_0.png)\n\nMore recently, illumination stability and negative bias—light illumination (NBL) stability have become more important because the bias stability problem for annealed TFTs has almost been solved by employing passivation layers. The photoresponse of AOS TFTs was reported for a-Zn–Sn–O\nTFTs [134] and a-IGZO TFTs [135, 136]. As can be seen in the typical transfer characteristics under monochromatic illumination in figure 16(a) [86], a-IGZO TFTs respond to photon energies above 2.3 eV, which is lower than the band gap (3.1 eV). Illumination increases Ioff and induces negative parallel shifts of Vth. The threshold photon energy corresponds well to the energy levels of the subgap DOS above VBM\ndetected by HX-PES (figure 14(b)); therefore, it is attributed to the excitation of electrons from deep subgap states to the conduction band.\n\nA similar photoresponse is also observed in steady-state photocurrent measurements of a-IGZO films [137], which show that the mobility-lifetime product decays slowly with the corresponding Urbach energies of ∼0.24 eV for unannealed a-IGZO and ∼0.16 eV for annealed a-IGZO. The photoresponse is reversible and very slow with a time constant exceeding thousands of seconds. This is attributed to the relaxation of metastable donor states with activation energies of 0.9–1.1 eV, and a similar model was proposed by Takechi et al [136].\n\nAn enhanced negative Vth shift is observed if a negative bias is applied with illumination (i.e. NBL stress) [138].\n\nLee *et al* reported that the NBL stability depends on the quality of the initial a-IGZO layers; i.e. although initial performance of high-quality and low-quality a-IGZO TFTs 11  \nis similar, the latter are rapidly degraded by stress [139]. We found that low-quality films have a much higher deep-subgap DOS, although their Hall mobilities and TFT characteristics appear similar to those of high-quality films [4]. These results indicate that only the electrical characteristics themselves cannot be used as an indicator of film quality, and it is important to improve the film quality to as high as possible to produce stable a-IGZO TFTs.\n\nLee *et al* [140] proposed a hole-trap model to explain the NBL instability. In this model, photoexcitation occurs from the valence band to subgap electron traps; electrons are localized at the subgap traps and holes are transported to traps in a channel—gate insulator interface or a gate insulator. We consider a similar mechanism but with the Fermi level in the a-IGZO channels rather high in the band gap above 0.5 eV below CBM (i.e. ∼2.5 eV above VBM) for the usual electron density [5], and with a small subgap DOS near CBM as discussed in section 5.6; therefore, the excitation to electron traps cannot explain the photoresponse under the 2.3 eV subgap illumination (note that almost all the subgap states are fully occupied below the Fermi level). Therefore, we consider that the subgap photon excitation mostly occurs from the deep-subgap DOS to the conduction band. Lee et al [140] also pointed out that moisture enhances the NBL\ninstability [140]. Sony reported that the use of a dc-sputtered AlOx passivation layer suppressed the photoresponse to a cold cathode fluorescent lamp [130]. For poly-ZnO TFTs, the Kyoto University and Kochi University of Technology groups reported that the photoleakage current originates from the large photoresponse in the source region [141].\n\n## 5.9. Tft Modeling\n\nMany subgap DOS and mobility models and analytical models have been reported for a-IGZO TFTs; however, combined and unified models have not been established yet. Here, we simply list the references for device simulation models [98, 142, 143], DOS models based on C–V methods [99], combinations of C–V methods and device simulations [100–104, 106], mobility models [105, 144], subthreshold models based on the Meyer–Neldel rule [145, 146], temperature dependences [143, 147] and circuit design [148, 149].\n\n## 6. Fundamental Properties And Physics Of A-Igzo\n\n6.1. Origin of large electron mobility in a-IGZO:\npseudo-band structure Hereafter, we discuss the fundamental physics and properties of AOSs. The first issue is why AOS TFTs have a good performance superior to that of a-Si:H TFTs, even though both AOSs and a-Si:H are amorphous. Before the report on transparent amorphous oxide conductors in 1995 [24–27], amorphous conductors were thought to have poor electronic conductivity because of hopping conduction in the disordered structure. This is the case for a-Si:H, where both electrons and holes migrate by hopping and not by band conduction, which is why the electron mobilities are as low as <1 cm2 V\n−1s\n−1\n\n![16_image_0.png](16_image_0.png)\n\n(see section 5.4 and [87]). In contrast, the electron mobilities in AOSs easily exceed 10 cm2 V\n−1s\n−1, and band conduction is observed, as evidenced by the clear Hall voltage signals and the degenerated temperature dependence of the Hall mobility [1, 144, 150]. This difference is explained by chemical bonding in [4]. The sp3 hybridized orbitals that form the carrier transport paths in Si are markedly distorted by disorder and form deep localized states. This results in the hopping conduction and the low drift mobilities in a-Si:H. In contrast, the electron paths in oxides of typical metals are formed mainly by s orbitals of the metal cations, and the overlaps between the wave functions of adjacent metal cations are not altered significantly by the disorder in AOSs, thus enabling band conduction and high mobilities.\n\nThis chemical bonding view is supported by firstprinciples DFT calculations. Figure 17 shows pseudo-band structures of a-InGaZnO4 and a-Si. Note that band theory is not applicable to non-periodic systems, but periodic calculations are still helpful to for understanding the stable atomic configurations and the nature of chemical bonds even for amorphous materials. In particular, the width of a band in such a (pseudo-)band structure reflects the local effective mass and transfer integrals [151, 152]. Figure 17(a) shows that the CBM band at ∼0.7 eV has a large dispersion with a bandwidth of ∼1 eV, similar to that of crystalline InGaZnO4 (c-IGZO)\n(the band effective masses are calculated as m\n∗\n\ne = 0.2 me for a-IGZO [153] and 0.18 me for c-IGZO [111]), indicating that the electrons in a-IGZO are delocalized.\n\nCalculations for a-Si (performed for a Si64 unit cell using a similar procedure to that in [153]) show that all the bands have very small widths, much less than 0.5 eV, indicating the suppression of band conduction. The band dispersion in a-Si is markedly suppressed because of the strong spatial directivity of the sp3 hybridized orbitals.\n\nSimilar results were obtained for a-IGZO in the high-energy conduction band region above 3 eV and the valence band region. The former is formed mainly by the p orbitals of metal cations and the latter is formed by the p orbitals of oxygen ions, whereas the CBM band is mainly composed of the s orbitals of metal cations. These results support the chemical bonding considerations above. Note that the valence band dispersion is very small and that isolated bands are found (at –0.2–0 eV) in a-IGZO, indicating that holes are strongly localized.\n\n## 6.2. Carrier Transport Mechanism\n\nIn–Ga–Zn–O exhibits unusual carrier transport properties as shown in figure 13(a). In particular, (i) its electron mobility increases with increasing free-electron density, (ii) the maximum Hall mobility is similar for crystalline InGaO3(ZnO)m [154] and a-IGZO. The reason for (ii) is explained in section 6.1: the band dispersions, i.e. the effective masses, are similar for c-IGZO and a-IGZO because their CBM bands are formed by the s orbitals. Behavior (i) is opposite that of single-crystalline semiconductors, in which the carrier mobility usually decreases with increasing carrier density because of scattering on the ionized donors or acceptors.\n\nBehavior (i) is explained by a percolation conduction model [105, 144, 150, 154]. As illustrated in figure 13(b), a distribution of potential barriers is formed above CBM\nowing to the disordered structure. Electrons take shorter transport paths at high temperatures even if these paths have high potential barriers (path (i) in figure 13(b)). They take a longer path (ii) with lower barriers at lower temperatures because they do not have sufficient thermal energy to pass the high potential barriers. In this model, the distribution of the potential barrier heights is characterized by the center energy\n(φ0) and distribution width (σφ). The model reproduces the temperature (T ) dependences of Hall measurements as shown in figures 18(a) and (b). The distributed potential barriers result in the deviation from simple thermal activation; i.e. the Arrhenius plot of conductivity (σ) shows nonlinear behavior in figure 18(b) and a better straight line is obtained in the log σ ∼ T\n−n(n ∼ 1/4) plot. Such behavior is usually explained by Mott's variable-range hopping, but it cannot be applied to a-IGZO because this material exhibits clear Hall voltage signals.\n\nAt intermediate electron densities, a weak localization behavior is observed in which σ follows the relation σ (T ) =\nσ0 + ηT\np/2 + λT\n1/2. Here σ0, η and λ are constants and p reflects the carrier scattering mechanism. For example, p = 1 corresponds to photon scattering [155–157]. This behavior can be explained by the percolation conduction model. Weak localization is also observed in amorphous In–O and In–Zn–O\nand is confirmed by the magnetic field response [158–161]. At lower electron densities, a Hall voltage anomaly appears in a-IGZO films at low temperatures (<120 K) as seen in the deviation of the calculated electron densities from the measured values (figure 18(a)).\n\nSemiconductor statistics analysis of nHall(T ) data yields donor levels at 100–150 meV for c-IGZO and at 110 meV below CBM for a-IGZO [105], and the percolation conduction model indicates that the potential barriers have an average height of 40–120 meV and a width of 20–30 meV as shown in figure 18(c).\n\nIt would also be interesting to examine the Meyer-Neldel\n(MN) rule [162], which is valid for many semiconductors\n\n![17_image_0.png](17_image_0.png)\n\nincluding a-Si:H [163, 164]. Conventionally σ is expressed as σ = σ0 exp(−Ea/kBT ), where σ0 is a prefactor and Ea is the activation energy. The MN rule indicates that ln σ0 and Ea are linearly related, i.e. σ0 = σ00 exp(AEa), A > 0, and this behavior in a-Si:H is related to the localized tail states [165]. The ln σ0–Ea plot is presented in figure 18(d),\nbut both c-IGZO and a-IGZO exhibit negative values of A. This behavior is called the 'anti-MN rule' and is observed, for example, in hydrogenated microcrystalline silicon (µc-Si:H) [166]. A regular MN relation was reported for a-IGZO TFTs [145, 146] in a large Ea region that corresponds to a low VGS and a low carrier density (Ne).\n\nThis changes to the anti-MN rule for low Ea < 80 meV [146],\nwhich is consistent with the data in figure 18(d) and similar to the case of µc-Si:H.\n\nLet us consider effective masses. The effective mass of a-IGZO (In:Ga:Zn = 1:1:1) is estimated to be ∼0.34 me from free-carrier absorption in highly doped a-IGZO films [150].\n\nThis value is similar to that of c-IGZO (0.32 me) and is consistent with the chemical bonding view discussed in section 6.1. Medvedeva [167] reports that electron effective masses in multicomponent transparent oxides can be estimated from their chemical composition. Canon investigated AOSs in the In-X-O system (X = Al, Si, Ge, etc)\nwith various compositions and found a clear relation between the estimated effective mass and µsat [168, 169].\n\nAs described above, it is easy to obtain a Hall mobility above 10 cm2 V\n−1s\n−1for a-IGZO (In : Ga : Zn = 1 : 1 : 1),\nbut larger mobilities are obtained for In-rich and Ga-poor compositions [170]. Especially, Zn-doped amorphous indium of a-IZO increases with increasing Ne for Ne < 1020 cm−3 and decreases at higher Ne. Such a decrease at high Ne is not observed for a-IGZO, while the increase in mobility with Ne extends to a wider range of Ne. It should be noted that the decrease in µ in the high Ne range is attributed not to conventional ionized impurity scattering but to other defects which are responsible for the 'gray' optical absorption in highly doped a-IZO.\n\nIn figure 19, the optical band gap is plotted against N\n2/3 e for a-IGZO [5] and a-IZO [171]. The figure shows that the optical band gap increases with increasing Ne, which is due to the band-filling effect, that is, the Burstein–Moss shift 1E\nBM\ng\n\n$$\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{g}}^{\\mathrm{BM}}=\\frac{h^{2}}{m_{\\mathrm{de}}}\\left(\\frac{3N_{\\mathrm{e}}}{16\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\right)^{2/3}.\\qquad\\qquad(7)$$\n\nThe DOS effective mass mde is obtained from the slope of this plot to be ∼0.56 me for a-IZO. For a-IGZO, the 1E\nBM\ng − N\n2/3 e plot does not follow a straight line, which might be due to the nonparabolic bands or the band-narrowing effect [5].\n\n## 6.3. Optical Properties\n\nBand gap values of AOSs are usually estimated from a Tauc plot [172], which has the form αE = [B(E − Eg)]\nr(α is the absorption coefficient, E is the photon energy, and B and r are constants). Assuming parabolic bands and the vanishing of the k-selection rule for optical transitions, which is valid for a crystal, r = 2 is usually employed in the Tauc plot. The estimated band gap (Tauc gap) is ∼3.2 eV for high-quality a-IGZO films (In : Ga : Zn = 1 : 1 : 1) and tends to decrease to\n∼3.0 eV for poor-quality films. It has also been reported that the Tauc-Lorentz model [173, 174] closely fits to the optical spectra of a-IGZO and c-IGZO [110, 175]. As discussed in relation to the deep subgap DOS and the NBL instability in sections 5.6–5.8, subgap optical absorption is important for the TFT stability [86]. It was found that optical absorption\n\n![18_image_0.png](18_image_0.png)\n\nspectra just below the band gap follow the Urbach law with an Urbach energy of ∼150 meV [109].\n\nOptical spectra also provide information about the subgap DOS. The a-IGZO films in figure 20 have band gaps of 3.0–3.2 eV, but there is observable optical absorption in the photon energy range from 2.0 eV to the band gap values\n(figures 20(b) and (c)). The widths of these subgap optical absorption features correspond well to the deep-subgap DOS\nabove VBM observed by HX-PES in figure 14(b), and they are considered to have the same origin.\n\n## 6.4. Structure Analysis\n\nIt is difficult to deduce the atomic structure of an amorphous material. The structure of AOSs was studied by grazing-incidence x-ray scattering (GIXS) and x-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) combined with molecular dynamics (MD), reverse Monte–Carlo simulations and DFT\ncalculations. Utsuno *et al* have reported the structures of a-In2O3 [176] and a-IZO [177] and found the number of edge-sharing network structures decreases and the number of In–Zn corner-sharing structures increases with increasing Zn content. We constructed a-IGZO models from MD/DFT\ncalculations based on the coordination structure obtained from XAFS, which showed that the coordination numbers around the cations are similar but slightly smaller than those in the corresponding crystals [5, 153]. Cho *et al* reported that the coordination structure of the Zn ions is distorted; they suggested that holes are localized on the Zn atoms [178]\nas on the basis of a DFT result for crystalline ZnO [179].\n\nThis view of the localized holes is consistent with DFT\npseudo-band calculations for a-IGZO [110, 111], but the verification of hole states is very difficult for a-IGZO because it is a wide-band-gap n-type semiconductor with almost no holes, unless illuminated.\n\nThe common conclusions of these studies are (i) the nearest-neighbor bond distances are similar in AOSs and \n\n![18_image_1.png](18_image_1.png)\n\nthe corresponding crystals, (ii) the coordination numbers of cations are similar or slightly smaller than those in the corresponding crystals (e.g. 4.5–6 for In, 4.3–5 for Ga-O\nand 4.6–5 for Zn-O), (iii) InOn polyhedra tend to form edge-sharing networks. The In-In distances are different between crystalline In2O3, c-IGZO and a-IGZO because of different angles in the connecting InOn polyhedra.\n\n## 6.5. Electronic Structures, Doping, Impurities And Defects\n\nThere have been several reports on theoretical calculations of the electronic structure and defects in c-IGZO [181–186] and a-IGZO [109–111, 153, 185, 187]. The pseudo-band structure is shown in figure 17(b) and the projected DOS is shown in figure 21, which corresponds to the peak in the valence band of HX-PES in figure 14(b). The calculated energy levels are underestimated because DFT provides energy levels as types of chemical potentials [188], which are smaller than ionization\n\n 11  \n\n![19_image_0.png](19_image_0.png)\n\npotentials. In addition, it is known that the incorporation of Coulomb repulsion is important for Zn 3d electrons [179] because omission of it raises the energy levels of Zn 3d and results in an overestimation of the Zn 3d–O 2p interaction and the VBM dispersion and in the further underestimation of the band gap.\n\nDFT calculations have provided the following information. Different structures with different densities from 5.8 to 6.1 g cm−3can be stable ([153] and unpublished data). The film density measured by grazing-incidence x-ray reflectivity (GIXRR) was ∼6.1 g cm−3. This value is ∼4%\nsmaller than that of crystalline InGaZnO4 (x-ray density, 6.379 g cm−3) but is in good agreement with the DFT results.\n\nOxygen deficiency in a-IGZO results in both deep, fully occupied states and shallow donor states in the band gap, which depend on the local structure of the oxygen defect [109]. A large open space in the structure traps electrons and forms a deep level similar to the deep-subgap DOS observed by HX-PES. It simultaneously forms a shallow unoccupied trap because the coherence of the CBM band is broken by the vacancy site [110]. If such a large open space is not formed in oxygen-deficient a-IGZO, then shallow donor states are formed that contributes to the enhancement of electronic conductivity.\n\nFigure 22 shows several oxygen deficiency structures. If an oxygen vacancy site is coordinated by a small number of cations (a) or if it is adjacent to a large open space (b), then deep traps and shallow traps are formed, whereas if an oxygen vacancy site is coordinated by a large number of cations with dense edge-sharing networks, then a shallow donor state is created. Whereas this tendency does not always hold, numerous calculations have confirmed it to be a general trend. This implies that the elimination of open spaces should be effective for making high-quality a-IGZO\nwith fewer defects. Jeong *et al* came to a similar conclusion.\n\nThey reported a variation in the a-IGZO density from 5.50 to 6.27 g cm−3for different deposition conditions; denser films had smaller S values and thus fewer defects [189].\n\nWe speculate that such an open space may also be related to the metastable donor states observed by steady-state photoconductivity measurements [137].\n\nDFT calculations provide the defect formation energies summarized in figure 23. The minimum formation energies are 2.0 eV for an oxygen vacancy (VO), 6.1 eV for an indium vacancy (VIn), 4.0 eV for a zinc vacancy (VZn) and 5.1 eV for a gallium vacancy (VGa) at the reduction limit. Takechi *et al* estimated the defect formation energy from the temperature dependences of TFT characteristics. They obtained a value of 1.05 eV, which corresponds to an activation energy of 0.35 eV [147]. This value is, however, much smaller than the high-temperature (<300 ◦C) conductivity activation energies of 0.65–1.5 eV [118], which correspond to the defect formation energies of 2–4.5 eV and agree well with the DFT\nresults. Figure 23 also provides the formation energies of other defects such as O–O and metal–metal (M–M) linkages, as well as that of excess hydrogen at a bond center (Hi) at the reduction limit, showing that these defects can be easily formed in a-IGZO.\n\nRegarding hydrogen doping, DFT calculations showed that the incorporation of a hydrogen atom into a-IGZO\nalways results in a shallow donor state [110, 111], but the incorporation of a H2 molecule would not change the chemical bonds and electronic structure (unpublished).\n\nIt has been reported that a-IGZO films deposited by sputtering contain hydrogen with a concentration above 3 ×\n1020 cm−3 which further increases to 2 × 1021 cm−3 with increasing H2O pressure during the deposition; however TFTs using these a-IGZO channels exhibit a positive Vth [190].\n\nOn the other hand, we observed that the low-temperature\n(∼200 ◦C) annealing of a-IGZO films in a diluted H2 gas increases the carrier density to ∼1020 cm−3. These results appear contradictory but can be explained using the DFT results and the electronic structure in figure 10(b).\n\nDFT calculations for H-incorporated a-IGZO suggest that hydrogen atoms, but not molecules, form –OH bonds and shallow donors. In addition, even if the incorporated hydrogen creates donors, they might be compensated by the deep traps as observed by HX-PES. This is an important issue to be clarified in the near future.\n\n## References\n\n[1] Nomura K, Ohta H, Takagi A, Kamiya T, Hirano M and Hosono H 2004 *Nature* 432 488\n[2] Kim H D, Park J-S, Mo Y G and Kim S S 2009 *9th Int.*\nMeeting on Information Display (12–16 October 2009, Seoul, Korea) 3-1\n[3] Hung M-C, Lin W-T, Chang J J, Chen P-L, Wu C-Y, Lin C-J,\nChiu H-L, Huang C-Y and Kao Y-C 2010 Int.

INTRODUCTION\nRECENT interest in the transition metal oxide thin film transistors (TFTs) for information display has led to a demand for various multi-component materials, composed primarily of heavy cations with *(n-1)d*10ns0 orbitals because they offer several intriguing properties, such as low temperature processing, high mobility (>10 cm2/Vs), excellent uniformity, and good transparency to visible light [1], [2]. These properties indicate that metal oxide TFTs are suitable replacements for amorphous and polycrystalline Si TFTs in active matrix (AM) displays, such as liquid crystal display and organic light emitting diodes. On the other hand, the next generation AM display requires a larger size (>60 inch), high resolution (>200 pixels per inch), and high frame rate\n(>120 Hz). In particular, a super high-vision with a pixel resolution of 7, 680 × 4, 320 at a frame rate of 240 Hz can be realized by reducing the allowed charge time per unit frame to <1.2 µsec, which is satisfied by the high mobility of >40 cm2/Vs [3]. The most established indium gallium zinc oxides (IGZO) TFTs have a typical mobility in the range from 10 and 20 cm2/Vs [4], [5]. Although the extraordinary high mobility (≥70 cm2/Vs) has been reported for ZnO, In2O3 and IZO TFTs, they suffer from an unacceptable large off-state current (10−9 ∼ 10−7 A), presumably due to the large current of the gate dielectric film or the high carrier density of the Manuscript received May 28, 2014; accepted June 6, 2014.

Therefore, it is still imperative to search for metal oxide TFTs with both high mobility (>40 cm2/Vs)\nand low off-state current (<10−12 A).\n\nIn this study, indium zinc tin oxide (IZTO) was used as a channel layer and the resulting IZTO TFTs exhibited promising performance: the field-effect mobility and off-state current\n(*IOFF* ) were 52.4 cm2/Vs and 2 × 10−13 A, respectively. The mobility of ∼ 52.4 cm2/Vs achieved in this study is the highest of any patterned metal oxide TFTs without compromising the other device parameters, such as *IOFF* . Moreover, IZTO TFTs with the bilayer passivation architecture of SiO2/SiO2 also showed better positive and negative gate bias stress stability than with the passivation architecture of SiNx/SiO2.\n\n## Ii. Experimental Procedure\n\nThe lithographically pattern Mo metal film on a SiO2/glass substrate was used as the gate electrode. A SiO2 (200nm)\nfilm as a gate dielectric layer was prepared by PECVD at 380°C. The 50-nm-thick IZTO film was deposited on a SiO2/Mo/SiO2/glass substrate by magnetron sputtering. The atomic ratio of the IZTO film was In: Zn: Sn = 40: 36: 24.\n\nAfter defining the IZTO channel using conventional lithography and etching, a 200-nm-thick SiO2 film was deposited and patterned as a etch stop layer (ESL). The SiO2 film was formed by PECVD at a power of 500 W, chamber pressure of 2.5 Torr, and chamber temperature of 300 °C. The gas flow rate of SiH4 and N2O were 50 and 9,000 sccm, respectively.\n\nThe Mo source/drain electrode was formed by sputtering and patterned by dry etching. Finally, the IZTO devices were passivated using either 100-nm-thick SiO2 or SiNx film. In the case of PECVD-derived SiO2 (SiNx) passivation, the chamber power, pressure and temperature were 700 (590) W, 250 (300) °C and 3.0 (1.5) Torr, respectively. The gas flow rates of SiH4 and N2O during deposition of SiO2 passivation layer were 150 and 4,000 sccm, respectively while those of SiH4 and N2 for SiNx passivation were 130 and 1,350 sccm, respectively. After preparing the IZTO device, the samples were annealed thermally at 300 °C for 1 hr. The transfer characteristics of the IZO TFTs with W/L = 270/15 µm were measured at room temperature using a Keithley 2636 source meter.\n\n## Iii. Results And Discussion\n\nFig. 1 shows the transfer characteristics of the oxide passivated and nitride passivated device. The field-effect mobility\n(µFE ) value was calculated from either the maximum transconductance (µFE,lin = Lgm/WCiVDS, where Ci and gm are 0741-3106 © 2014 IEEE.

The threshold voltage (VTH)\nwas determined by adjusting the gate voltage, which induces a drain current of L/W × 10nA at a VDS of 5.1V. The sub-threshold gate swing (SS = dVGS/dlogIDS[V/decade])\nwas extracted from the linear part of the log(IDS) vs. VGS plot. The interfacial (Nit) and bulk trap (Nss) density were calculated from the SS values. The oxide-passivated device exhibited remarkable performance: the µFE,lin , µFE,sat , SS, VTH\nand ION/OFF ratio were 48.0±3.5, 41.0±2.5 cm2/Vs, 0.14 ±\n0.03 V/decade, −0.5 ± 0.2 V, and >2 × 109, respectively, as shown in Fig. 1(a) and (c). Promising performance was also observed for a nitride-passivated device: the µFE,lin , µFE,sat , SS,\nVTH and ION/OFF ratio were 52.4 ± 15.0, 36.0 ± 13.9 cm2/Vs, 0.20 ± 0.03 V/decade, 0.1 ± 0.12 V and >2×109, respectively\n[Fig. 1(b) and (d)]. The Nit (NSS) values for the oxide and nitride passivated devices were 2.1 × 1011 (4.3 × 1016) and 3.6 × 1011 cm−2eV−1 (7.2 × 1016 cm−3eV−1), respectively.\n\nIt is interesting to discuss why the high mobility can be achieved for a-IZTO TFTs. In the a-IGZO system, the In 5s orbital with spherical symmetry is responsible for n-type conduction because its ionic radius is larger than those of Zn2+ and Ga3+ ions [3]. Therefore, the higher indium content in a-IGZO system gives rise to the enhanced mobility due to the easy percolation path and its lower effective electron mass. On the other hand, the maximum indium content (<50 at%) was limited because the shallow oxygen vacancy defect can be created easily in the indium-rich IGZO system, leading to the strong compromise of VTH and *IOFF*. To control the net carrier density of the channel layer, the gallium cation was incorporated as a strong oxygen binder, i.e. a carrier suppressor in the a-IGZO semiconductor [1], [3]. In this study, the Ga cation was replaced with a Sn cation. Therefore, the physical role of Sn ion is important for understanding the carrier transporting property in a-IZTO system. In this study, the relative cation composition of In and Sn ions was 40 and\n\n![1_image_1.png](1_image_1.png)\n\n24 at.%, respectively. According to a recent calculation of the electronic structure, the Sn ion acts as a mobility enhancer, similar to the In ion in a-IZTO system, which can be attributed to the similar Sn 5s orbital structure to In 5s orbital [9].\n\nTherefore, the higher In and Sn content (∼64 at.%) in IZTO\nfilm facilitates the effective intercalation of the Sn or In 5s orbital or makes the percolation path smaller, leading to high mobility of the resulting a-IZTO TFTs [9], [10]. Although the relative portion of the mobility enhancer including In and Sn ions is very high (∼64 at.%), the VTH and *IOFF* values of the resulting devices were not deteriorated. This suggests that the Sn cations make it difficult to create a shallow oxygen vacancy defect in the amorphous IZO system. In other words, the Sn cation appears to act as not only a mobility enhancer, but also a relatively good oxygen binder. This postulation was consistent with the result of first principle calculations: the formation energy of oxygen vacancy defects in Sn-doped IZO was ∼0.3 eV higher than that in the IZO system [11].\n\nIt is noted that the high mobility of a-IZTO TFTs is partly attributed to the hydrogen incorporation from the PECVDderived ESL and passivation layer.\n\nThe gate bias stress-induced instability of the oxide and nitride passivated devices were compared. The devices are stressed under the following conditions: the applied VGS\nvalues were (Vth + 20) and (Vth − 20) V for the positive bias stress (PBS) and negative bias stress (NBS) conditions, respectively and the VDS value was fixed to 5.1V for 3,600s.\n\nFig. 2(a) and (b) show the evolution of the transfer characteristics as a function of PBS time for the oxide and nitride passivated devices, respectively. The oxide passivated device exhibited stable behavior: the shift in VTH for the oxide passivated devices was ∼0.04. In contrast, the nitridepassivated device suffered from a VTH shift of 1.02V for an identical PBS duration. The inferior PBS instability of the nitride device can be attributed to its higher interfacial\n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)\n\ntrap density. The creation of new defect states in the channel layer can be excluded for the possible origin because stretchout phenomena were not observed in the subthreshold drain current region and capacitance voltage (C-V) characteristics, as shown in Fig. 2(b) and (d).\n\nThe superior stability of the oxide passivated device compared to the nitride passivated device was also observed for the NBS induced instability. Fig. 3(a) and (b) show the evolution of the transfer characteristics for both devices under NBS conditions. The application of NBS at room temperature on the oxide passivated device caused a smaller negative VTH shift of 0.67V [Fig. 3(a)]. In contrast, the NBS stability of the nitridepassivated device deteriorated substantially, which exhibited a negative VTH shift of ∼1.50 V, as shown in Fig. 3(b).\n\nThe superior NBS stability of the oxide passivated device was observed consistently from the change in the of C-V\ncharacteristics for both devices [Fig. 3(c) and (d)]. Here the superior NBS stability of the oxide passivated device is also consistent with its lower interfacial density. The inferior NBS\nstability of the nitride passivated device seems to be related to the larger incorporation of hydrogen to the IZTO channel region because the SiNx film contains more hydrogen species than the SiO2 film [12]. Very recently, it was calculated the substitutional hydrogen at oxygen site (HO) can be stabilized to a pair of negative interstitial hydrogen (H−i ) and neutral oxygen vacancy (V0O) when the Fermi energy level (EF) is near the conduction band edge [13]. This H-DX center can be converted to a shallow donor (H+O) and a free electron when the quasi-EF level near the channel interface moves downward due to the application of NBS [13]. This deep-to-shallow state transition of hydrogen related defect center can give rise to the VTH instability. Therefore, the nitride passivated device would exhibit a larger VTH shift compared to the oxide passivated device [12], [14].\n\nIn summary, the IZTO TFTs exhibited promising device performance irrespective of the passivation structure: the µFE,lin , SS, VTH and ION/OFF ratio for both devices was 48.0 ∼ 52.4 cm2/Vs, 0.14 ∼ 0.20 V/decade, −0.5 ∼ 0.1 V and >2 × 108. In terms of the PBS and NBS stability, the oxide passivated device showed better resistance than the nitride passivated device, which can be attributed to its lower interfacial or bulk trap density. Therefore, the IZTO TFTs can be used as an alternative backplane device for the next generation AM displays.\n\n## References\n\n[1] K.

        "text": "# Mobility–Stability Trade-Off In Oxide Thin-Film Transistors\n\nYu-Shien Shiah1, Kihyung Sim1, Yuhao Shi1, Katsumi Abe2, Shigenori Ueda  3, Masato Sasase1, Junghwan Kim  1 ✉ and Hideo Hosono  1,3 ✉\nThin-film transistors based on amorphous oxide semiconductors could be used to create low-cost backplane technology for large flat-panel displays. However, a trade-off between mobility and stability has limited the ability of such devices to replace current polycrystalline silicon technologies. Here we show that the sensitivity of amorphous oxide semiconductors to externally introduced impurities and defects is determined by the location of the conduction-band minimum and the relevant doping ability. Using bilayer-structured thin-film transistors, we identify the exact charge-trapping position under bias stress, which shows that the Fermi-level shift in the active layer can occur via electron donation from carbon-monoxide-related impurities. This mechanism is highly dependent on the location of the conduction-band minimum and explains why carbon-monoxide-related impurities greatly affect the stability of high-mobility indium tin zinc oxide transistors but not that of low-mobility indium gallium zinc oxide transistors. Based on these insights, we develop indium tin zinc oxide transistors with mobilities of 70 cm2 **(V s)–1**\nand low threshold voltage shifts of –0.02 V and 0.12 V under negative- and positive-bias temperature stress, respectively.\n\nAmorphous oxide semiconductors (AOSs), such as indium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO), are promising channel materials for thin-film transistors (TFTs) used in flat-panel displays due to their high mobility, good uniformity over large areas, low-temperature processability and optical transparency1. \n\nAOS-based pixel-driven devices have already been commercialized for use in small state-of-the-art displays. However, the next generation of display technologies require TFTs with an electron mobility greater than 10 cm2 (Vs)–1 that can be substantially higher in some cases. For example, super-high-vision technology, which mostly uses organic light-emitting diodes (LEDs) or quantum-dot LEDs, requires TFTs with an electron mobility higher than 40 cm2 (Vs)–1 (ref. 2). High-mobility AOSs can also be used in non-display fields, including chip input/output, image sensors and power systems3–5. \n\nFurthermore, for power systems, the intrinsic properties of AOSs such as their wide bandgap, low-temperature process and high mobility can help with high-voltage operation and reduce power dissipation with compatible on-chip processes.\n\nA range of high-mobility AOSs have already been explored. \n\nHowever, serious stability problems under bias testing have been observed in high-mobility AOSs. Negative-bias temperature stress (NBTS), positive-bias temperature stress (PBTS) and negative-bias illumination stress (NBIS) are the core tests used to evaluate the reliability of TFTs. NBTS stability tends to degrade with an increase in the field-effect mobility and this instability is highly dependent on the chemical composition of the AOS. Electron mobility significantly differs depending on conduction-band dispersion, which is mainly governed by the magnitude of spatial overlap between the post-transition metal cations6. For example, low-mobility indium gallium oxide (InGaOx; IGO) TFTs exhibit high NBTS stability, whereas high-mobility indium tin zinc oxide (InSnZnOx; ITZO) \nTFTs exhibit low NBTS stability. This mobility–stability trade-off is well known, but no scientific reasoning has been reported to explain the correlation (NBTS stabilities are compared in Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1a,b).\n\nIn this Article, we report a solution to the mobility–stability trade-off observed in AOS TFTs. We focus on the NBTS mechanism, the correlation of electronic structures with NBTS and the possible origins of NBTS. We show that (1) NBTS is due to a Fermi-level shift (change in carrier density) of the AOS itself, (2) the deep conduction-band minimum (CBM) of high-mobility AOSs prefers to accept electrons from the outside and (3) carbon monoxide (CO)-related impurities donate electrons to the CBM of AOSs at room-temperature NBTS (also referred to as NBS here). Based on this understanding, we develop ultrastable ITZO TFTs with mobilities of 70 cm2 (Vs−1).\n\n## Identification Of Nbts Mechanism Utilizing Bilayer Channels\n\nConventionally, charge trapping in the gate insulator is used as a model to explain the shift in the threshold voltage (Vth) in transistors. As illustrated in Fig. 1a, positive charges trapped at the gate-insulator interface induce electron accumulation near the gate insulator at gate voltage VG =0V. There are several candidates for the positive charges, such as holes (h+), protons (H+) and ionized oxygen vacancies (VO\n+). In fact, there have been some reports on NBTS in AOS TFTs based on this model7. However, we were doubtful whether charge trapping at the gate insulator can explain the differences in behaviours between high- and low-mobility AOSs. To validate the charge-trapping model, the following criteria should be satisfied: high-mobility AOSs must possess a higher hole density or mobility; high-mobility AOSs must possess higher hydrogens or proton conductivity; and high-mobility AOSs must possess a much smaller hole-injection barrier against the gate insulator. However, we determined that these criteria are impractical. For example, IGO and ITZO possess similar ionization potentials of ~7.2 eV, implying that both have a similar hole-injection barrier height against the gate insulator. Moreover, it was confirmed that the number of hydrogens incorporated in IGO and ITZO are fairly similar. Therefore, we excluded the charge-trapping model in the gate insulator and \n\n \n\n![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)\n\nfocused on the possibility of the Fermi-level shift or change in carrier density of the AOS itself, as illustrated in Fig. 1b.\n\nIt is well known that the carrier density is closely related to Vth in TFTs. To determine how Vth differs for different carrier densities, we performed device simulation. Figure 1c presents the simulation results, which reveal that the Vth shift (ΔVth) became significant when the carrier density was >1017 cm−3: ΔVth was –6.0V when the carrier density increased from 1×1017 to 5×1017 cm−3 and it was \n–13.5V when the carrier density increased from 1017 to 1018 cm−3. \n\nThis result implies that the NBTS phenomenon may occur if the carrier density in bulk AOS increases during the bias stress test. However, it is almost impossible to determine which model should be applied to the observed NBTS because the final transfer curves are the same irrespective of the mechanisms displayed in Fig. 1a,b. Therefore, identifying the dominant NBTS mechanism is critical to determine the origin of the trade-off.\n\nHere we propose a method to easily identify the NBTS \nmechanism. As illustrated in Fig. 2a, a bottom-gate TFT with a bilayer active-channel structure was employed. One layer was an NBTS-stable AOS, whereas the other was an NBTS-unstable AOS. We employed IGO and ITZO for this purpose, and their single-layer TFT characteristics are presented in Fig. 2b,c, respectively. The stacking order should be noted: the NBTS-stable layer \n(IGO) is adjacent to the gate insulator, and the NBTS-unstable layer \n(ITZO) is outermost from the gate insulator. This bilayer structure enables to distinguish the two NBTS mechanisms by observing the relationship between the field-effect mobility and VG. As displayed in Supplementary Fig. 2a, a key point is that IGO and ITZO exhibit fairly different tendencies in the field-effect mobility versus VG curve, owing to the very different electron mobilities \n(IGO: ~20 cm2 (Vs)–1; ITZO: ~50 cm2 (Vs)–1). Namely, we can identify which channel is open and which channel's Vth varies from the field-effect mobility versus VG curve.\n\nFigure 2d,e presents the device simulation results corresponding to the gate-insulator charge-trapping model and Fermi-level shift model, respectively. It is worth noting that the two different NBTS mechanisms result in obviously different tendencies. The gate-insulator charge-trapping model results in a parallel shift in the field-effect mobility versus VG curve, as shown in Fig. 2d. For the Fermi-level shift model, we should focus on the region of negative-differential field-effect mobility. This region is attributed to the mode shift from the bilayer channel (ITZO/IGO) to single-layer channel (IGO layer). \n\n 801 Thus, the position of the negative-differential field-effect mobility region will not change when Vth of the IGO layer is the same. \n\nConsequently, it was confirmed that the experimental data agree well with the Fermi-level shift (change in carrier density) model, as illustrated in Fig. 2e,f. This characteristic can be demonstrated by the close agreement between the observed data and superimposed plots of the single-layer IGO-based and ITZO-based device (Supplementary Fig. 2b). We believe that this bilayer TFT structure can even be extended to the identification of the PBTS or NBIS mechanism.\n\n## Electronic Structure And Carrier-Doping Ability Of Aoss\n\nBased on Fig. 2, NBTS instability was attributed to the change in the electron density of the AOS (ITZO). The next question is to determine the dominant factor controlling the mobility of AOSs. There exists a universal tendency in electronic structures and chemical composition. For AOSs, the CBM mainly consists of vacant s orbitals of metal cations. Therefore, conduction-band dispersion is highly dependent on the level of spatial overlap of the s orbitals of metal cations; cations with larger vacant s orbitals are more effective in achieving larger dispersion (small effective mass), as indicated in Fig. 3b,c. \n\nGenerally, ECBM tends to deepen with an increase in conduction-band dispersion, as demonstrated in Fig. 3a. This phenomenon explains why high-mobility AOSs consist of heavier-metal cations, such as In and Sn. Furthermore, the variation in ECBM, namely, the electron affinity, results in large differences in electrical properties, such as the carrier-doping ability8. Most AOSs have a wide bandgap of \n>2.5eV; thus, the contribution of thermally excited electrons (from the valence band) is negligible at ambient temperature, implying that only ionized donors contribute to the carrier density.\n\nTo date, several studies have proposed possible candidates for n-type dopants in AOSs, such as oxygen vacancy (VO) and hydrogens (OH− or H−)9,10. However, there have been a limited number of studies on the carrier-doping limit in AOSs. Here we would like to emphasize that the activation energy (Ea) of n-type dopants in AOSs differs depending on the chemical composition. In general, the carrier density is expressed as ne = ND exp (− Ea kT ), where ne, ND, \nEa, K and T denote carrier density, donor density, activation energy, Boltzmann constant and temperature, respectively. The carrier density significantly varies according to Ea, as indicated in Fig. 3d, even if the donor densities are the same. Evidently, ND should increase from ~6×1016 to 3×1018 cm−3 when Ea changes from 0.05 to 0.15 eV to obtain ne=1016 cm−3. Namely, the required donor densities \n\n![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)\n\nbecome approximately 100 times different with a difference in Ea of 0.1 eV. As indicated in Fig. 3e, the Ea values depend on the chemical composition. In general, AOSs with a deep ECBM exhibit a small Ea. \n\nHowever, it has been observed that Ea is also related to the ionization potential11,12. The origin of Ea is not discussed in this paper. The most important fact is that Ea significantly varies with the chemical composition, and the necessary donor densities are different. \n\nConsequently, the difference in Ea determines the defect tolerance of AOSs to VO and H-related defects. In other words, ne in an AOS with a smaller Ea is more easily affected by VO and H-related defects.\n\nHere let us suppose that there are two AOSs with different initial values of ND: one AOS has an ND value of 1016 cm−3, whereas the other has an ND value of 1019 cm−3. In addition, VO or H-related defects of 1018 cm−3 are formed in post-processing, such as photolithography, gate insulator and passivation process. It is expected that the ND value of the AOS with initial ND of 1016 cm−3 changes to 1018 cm−3. Thus, the defect tolerance can be defined as the degree of insensitivity to foreign impurity donors. This phenomenon explains why high-mobility AOSs, such as ITZO, are sensitive to the processing environment as well as impurities. It should be noted that the high-mobility AOS itself is not a defective material.\n\nCO-related impurity in AOSs and its influence on NBTS\nAs discussed above, high-mobility AOSs, such as ITZO, have a deep ECBM with shallow donor levels (small Ea of donors); a smaller value of ND is required for AOSs with shallower donor levels and a smaller value of ND may make ITZO to become more sensitive to defects and impurities. In this context, we show that a large number of CO-related impurities were introduced after the photolithography process. The thermal desorption spectra shown in Fig. 4a,b indicate that carbon-related impurities, namely, CO and CO2, were detected only for the ITZO thin film that underwent the photolithography process, which was also confirmed by hard X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (HAXPES) (Fig. 4c–f)13. The C1s peak clearly shows the existence of C–O and C=O components; thus, the O1s peak should also be deconvoluted at least into three components: lattice oxygen, C–O and C=O (refs. 14–20). It should be noted that the O1s peak at around 532 eV has been well used for the determination of VO defects in this field21–23. This background implies that if we have not revealed the CO-related impurity, this study could have been concluded as the VO-related issue because the carbon-related O1s peak also takes the position of ~532 eV (refs. 14–20).\n\nThe amounts of both CO and CO2 were revealed to be \n~5×1015 cm−2, and Auger electron spectroscopy measurement indicated that CO-related impurities existed in the surface region (Supplementary Fig. 3). In addition, the thermal desorption spectra indicated that the CO-related impurities were not physisorbed species because the desorption temperature was high (~350 °C). Thus, the CO-related impurities were formed as a result of the chemical reaction between the oxide surface and alkali photoresist (PR). \n\n 802\n\n  \n\n![3_image_0.png](3_image_0.png)\n\n![3_image_1.png](3_image_1.png)\n\n![4_image_0.png](4_image_0.png)\n\nIt was also confirmed that the chemical reaction is not limited to a specific PR; PRs of different companies yielded the same results, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 4.\n\nBefore investigating the effect of CO-related impurities on TFTs, it was first necessary to consider how to eliminate these impurities. \n\nBased on the fact that all CO-related impurities desorb at >350 °C \n(Fig. 4a,b), we modified the conventional TFT fabrication process, as illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 5: 400 °C post-annealing was performed in the final step, which made it possible to obtain a CO-impurity-free ITZO TFT. Next, ITZO TFTs with different amounts of CO-related impurities were prepared by exposing the TFTs to PR and varying the annealing temperature. Consequently, we observed a noticeable correlation between the CO amount and NBTS instability, as illustrated in Fig. 5. It should be noted that CO-related impurity was not limited to ITZO. Almost the same number of CO-related impurities were also confirmed for conventional AOSs after the same photolithography process, as illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 6a. Nevertheless, it is interesting to note that the IGZO TFT rarely suffers from NBTS instability even if there were the same number of CO-related impurities, as illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 6b. This phenomenon was most likely due to the mobility–stability trade-off. Only the ITZO TFT suffered from serious NBS instability by CO-related impurities. We note that the NBS mechanism is based on the increase in carrier density in ITZO, implying that CO-related impurities may form donor-like states.\n\nTo clarify that the obtained NBTS stability in Fig. 5e is not attributable to the thermal annealing effect, we fabricated an impurity-free ITZO TFT by the shadow-mask process (width, W=1,000 µm; length, L=500 µm). As shown in Supplementary Fig. 7, the shadow-mask process was revealed to greatly improve the NBTS stability. This result strongly supports the correlation between the CO-related impurity and NBTS instability. On the other hand, we also found that the residual gas can be another source of CO-related impurities. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 8, a fairly large amount of CO-related impurities was confirmed for the sample deposited in the vacuum chamber with a base pressure of ~10–5Pa. This result suggests that all the possible sources of CO-related impurities should be considered for high-mobility AOS TFTs.\n\nTo further understand the role of CO-related impurities, we focused on conventional CO gas sensors based on metal oxides and noticed that there have already been many studies on the charge transfer phenomenon between metal oxides and adsorbates by Fermi-level modulation24,25. The proposed charge transfer mechanism is as follows: when the Fermi level is shifted down by gate biasing, the adsorbates donate electrons to metal oxides. There have also been many reports on gas sensors utilizing this mechanism, called gas field-effect transistors24–29. Here we considered why the CO-related impurities influence higher-mobility AOSs rather than the lower-mobility ones. The ECBM value is an important factor because electrons are transferred from the adsorbates to the conduction band of AOSs, implying that the deep ECBM enables to get electrons more readily from the adsorbates. The Wolkenstein model also suggests that charge transfer from the adsorbates is strongly governed by the Fermi level and ECBM (ref. 29).\n\nBased on conventional studies and our experimental results, Supplementary Fig. 9a,b presents the schematic of the donor-like states formed by CO-related impurities. It was supposed that the CO-related impurities formed a deep state before gate biasing since there was no difference in the carrier density of ITZO samples with and without the CO impurities. Then, a significant change in the carrier density appeared after NBS, indicating that the initial deep state was transformed into a shallow state. There have been a number of studies regarding the adsorption of CO on semiconducting oxide surfaces30–32. The different behaviours of ITZO and IGZO \nTFTs towards CO-related impurities may be explained based on the discussion above. In particular, we proposed that AOSs with large 804\n\n![5_image_0.png](5_image_0.png)\n\nEa, such as IGZO, are rarely affected by externally introduced impurities, which can be easily understood from the formula shown in Supplementary Fig. 9c; the primary factor is the location of the ECBM.\n\n## Ultrastable Itzo Tfts With High Mobility Of 70 Cm2 **(V S)–1**\n\nWe have shown that an NBS-stable ITZO TFT can be created by eliminating CO-related impurities. However, it should be noted that, in practice, TFTs are exposed to much higher stresses. In this respect, we conducted all the relevant stress tests: NBTS, PBTS and NBIS. To avoid surface-related problems, the ITZO active layer was passivated by 5-nm-thick amorphous Zn–Si–O (ZSO) \n(Supplementary Figs. 10–12). The use of ZSO (ref. 33) led to the following effects: (1) eliminating the surface states of ITZO and (2) \nfully blocking charge transfer between the ITZO layer and the outside. We also questioned what degree of mobility is practically available for AOS TFTs. Thus, we studied more In-rich ITZO, namely, In0.4Sn0.4Zn0.2Ox.\n\nConsequently, we determined that the ITZO TFT with a high mobility of ~70 cm2 (Vs)–1 meets the requirements for practical use \n(Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 2), which validates the potential of ITZO TFT as an alternative to low-temperature polysilicon. In addition, we found that PBTS is mainly caused by layers adjacent to the active layers. Simply put, when depositing the second layer, such as the passivation layer or gate insulator, onto the ITZO layer, relatively high oxygen partial pressure(PO2) is required to suppress the reduction of the ITZO layer. Here the high PO2 may form trap states attributed to excess oxygen depending on what type of passivation layer is used. As illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 13, serious PBTS instability occurred with 5-nm-thick amorphous Ga2Ox passivation layers that were readily involved in excess oxygen-related trap states34. Above all, it should be noted that the use of high PO2 for the second layer is also the reason why ITZO should maintain a small donor density (ND).\n\nCommercially, NBIS instability is not as problematic as NBTS and PBTS because it can be readily overcome by adopting 805 light-shielding layers. However, NBIS is a concern that should be resolved in the near future for fully transparent electronics. It is interesting to note that NBIS is greatly improved by applying treatment to eliminate CO-related impurities and subsequently passivating ITZO with ZSO (Supplementary Fig. 11)35–37. Also, note that the IGZO TFT discussed in a previous study exhibited a large Vth shift of –9V under the same NBIS condition38. In contrast, the ITZO TFTs in this study exhibited much better NBIS \nstability (Fig. 6c,f); a small Vth shift of −0.48V was observed for the In0.2Sn0.4Zn0.4Ox TFT. Furthermore, we attributed the relatively low NBIS stability of the In-rich ITZO TFT to its narrower optical bandgap (Supplementary Fig. 14).\n\nFurther, we compared the persistent photoconductivity of two ITZO thin films (with and without a 5-nm-thick ZSO passivation layer). As shown in Supplementary Fig. 15, the ITZO thin films were illuminated for 10min and then a time-dependent Hall measurement was conducted in darkness. Surprisingly, the ITZO thin film with ZSO exhibited almost no change in carrier density, whereas the carrier density of the ITZO thin film without ZSO increased from 2×1017 to 2×1018 cm–3, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 15a. \n\nThis result effectively explains why the ZSO-passivated ITZO TFT exhibits high NBIS stability. On the other hand, it should be noted that the 5-nm-thick ZSO does not contribute to optical absorption owing to its wide bandgap and ultrathin thickness (Supplementary Fig. 15b), indicating that the numbers of absorbed photons are almost the same for both samples. It is, thus, inferred that the photostability of ITZO is mainly governed by surface defects such as VO. Other studies have also reported that a passivation layer of Y2O3 effectively eliminates surface defects in IGZO (refs. 35–37). \n\nConsequently, this study indicates that obtaining an impurity- and defect-free surface or interface is a key factor to the stability of AOS TFTs. In this respect, d.c.-sputtering-based passivation or interlayer (between the active layer and gate insulator) may be a solution to block unintended impurities and damage from the conventional plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition process; there may be another challenge in obtaining the resistive thin films from the sputtering target applicable by the d.c. power source. Nevertheless, we think that there are many candidate materials based on the following concept: polycrystalline phase for ceramic targets exhibits high conductivity but the sputter-deposited amorphous phase is resistive.\n\nOn the other hand, many studies have used a stretched exponential function to analyse the phenomenon of bias instabilities in AOS TFTs9,39–46. This function is often used to explain the kinetics in disordered systems and expressed as follows: \nΔVth(t)=(Vth(∞)–Vth(0))×(1–exp(–t/τ)β), where Vth(∞) is the threshold voltage when time approaches infinity, Vth(0) is the initial threshold voltage, τ is a time constant and β is an energy barrier parameter39–46. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 16, we revealed that the τ and β values significantly change by eliminating the CO-related impurity: for the stable ITZO TFT, τ=2.6×104 and β=0.5; for the unstable ITZO TFT, τ=2.9×103 and β=0.7. Some studies in the literature on AOS TFTs have shown that the value of β does not change44–46. Our understanding is that β changes when the charge transfer mechanism or origin differs because β is the parameter reflecting the distribution of the energy barrier. Another study reported that β considerably differs in a ZnO-based gas sensor depending on the introduced gas species47. A high-mobility, highly stable In2O3 TFT has been recently reported, where it was shown that β differs by the difference in the Fermi levels40. On the other hand, we confirmed that ΔVth(t → ∞) is different by two orders of magnitude between the stable and unstable ITZO TFTs. For the stable ITZO TFT, ΔVth(t → ∞) was only –0.11V, whereas it was \n–16.60V for the unstable ITZO TFT. This result validates not only the effect of the CO-related impurity but also the intrinsic potential of ITZO TFTs for commercial application.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nWe have reported the origin of the mobility–stability trade-off in AOS TFTs. The electronic structures and electrical properties of a range of AOSs were examined. The bilayer-structured TFT revealed that the NBTS mechanism is mainly attributed to the Fermi-level shift in the ITZO itself. Higher-mobility AOSs tend to have a deep ECBM (that is, electron affinity), leading to large differences in the carrier-doping ability. Shallower donor levels are formed for higher-mobility AOSs. AOSs with shallow donor levels (small Ea) should have a relatively small number of donors to obtain the appropriate carrier density (~1016 cm−3) for TFTs. The variation in the required donor densities results in great differences in the defect tolerance. AOSs with a smaller initial donor density suffer more from externally introduced defects (for example, VO\n+) or impurities \n(for example, H+ or H−). CO-related impurities, which play a role of gatebias dependent donor, were shown to be the origin of NBTS \ninstability. Eliminating CO-related impurities, combined with further surface passivation, allowed us to fabricate ultrastable ITZO \nTFTs with a mobility of 70 cm2 (Vs)–1. With such devices, there may be further unknown impurities introduced during manufacturing, which could play additional roles. Nevertheless, our study has provided an insight and understanding that allows ultrastable high-mobility AOS TFTs to be fabricated.\n\n## Methods\n\nFabrication of ITZO thin flm and characterization. ITZO thin flms were deposited at room temperature via radio-frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering using 3 in. ceramic targets (In:Sn:Zn=20:40:40 and 40:40:20 at.%). Te following sputtering parameters were used: RF power, 150W; target–substrate distance, 110mm; total pressure, 0.4Pa; partial oxygen pressure, 25%. Te flm density (as shown in Supplementary Fig. 17) and flm thickness were measured by grazing-incidence X-ray refectivity spectroscopy (SmartLab, Rigaku), and the crystal structure of the ITZO flm was characterized by X-ray difraction spectroscopy (SmartLab, Rigaku). Te electrical properties of ITZO were evaluated by a.c.-feld Hall efect measurement (ResiTest8400, TOYO) in the van der Pauw confguration, and the optical bandgap and absorption coefcient of ITZO were acquired by an ultraviolet–visible spectrometer (UH4150, Hitachi). \n\nTen, 40nm ITZO flms were prepared for thermal desorption spectroscopy measurement (ESCO) and Auger electron spectroscopy (PHI 710, ULVAC-PHI). HAXPES was performed at the BL15XU undulator beamline (photon energyhν=hν 5,953.4hν eV) on 100nm ITZO flms in SPring-8. Te energy levels of conduction band minimum and valence band maximum (ECBM and EVBM) of the AOSs were determined by using the ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy, HAXPES and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy.\n\nDevice fabrication. A schematic of the fabrication method is illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 5. Bottom-gate and top-contact TFTs were fabricated on SiO2/p++-silicon substrate. The thickness of the thermally grown SiO2 was 150 nm. The sequential 20 nm ITZO layer was deposited on SiO2 by 150W RF \nmagnetron sputtering. After depositing the ITZO layer, the device was subjected to thermal annealing at 400 °C for 1 h in air. The source/drain electrodes were constructed by a 5 nm conductive ITZO layer (deposited at 0% partial oxygen pressure) and a 60 nm gold layer. The channel width and length were patterned to be 60 and 30 μm (W=300 µm and L=50 µm were used only for the devices shown in Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1), respectively, by photolithography (mask aligner MA-10, Mikasa). The lift-off process was employed for all the patterning procedures. For the NBTS, PBTS and NBIS samples, an additional ZSO (Zn:Si=80:20 at.%) layer was deposited on the device by 60W RF \nmagnetron sputtering at 25% partial oxygen pressure under 0.4 Pa at a distance of 80 mm from the target. Thermal annealing (320 °C for 1 h) was performed again to recover the damage from plasma.\n\nDevice characterization. All the devices were measured at a drain–source voltage of VDS=0.1V in a vacuum (1×10−3Pa) by using a B1500A instrument (Keysight). \n\nThe NBS conditions were set up at Vth –20V. NBTS and PBTS were measured under the following conditions: negative gate bias, Vth –20V; positive gate bias, Vth+20V; temperature, 60 °C. Illumination stress was measured under an LED \nlight source with the spectrum shown in Supplementary Fig. 14. The spectrum and illuminance of the LED were detected by a C-7000 SPECTROMASTER instrument (Sekonic). NBIS was measured under the following conditions: negative gate bias, Vth –20V; illuminance, 15,000 lx.\n\nDevice simulation. The device characteristics were calculated by a device simulator (Atlas, Silvaco). The simulation employed a configuration similar to that of the fabricated device and a mobility model with carrier density dependence48. \n\nThe following values were used in this simulation: bandgap, 3.7 eV for ITZO and 4.0 eV for IGO; electron affinity, 4.7 eV for ITZO and 4.5 eV for IGO; mobility of degenerate states, 40 cm2 (Vs)–1 for ITZO and 20 cm2 (Vs)–1 for IGO; critical carrier density, 1×1020 cm–3 for ITZO and 4×1020 cm–3 for IGO; power factor of mobility, 0.2 for ITZO and 0.5 for IGO.\n\nElectrical parameter extraction and impurity concentration. The field-effect mobility of the device was calculated by the following equation: \nμLinear = L WCoxVds gmmax, where µLinear is the linear mobility of the device; gmmax is the maximum transconductance; Cox is the unit area capacitance of the gate dielectric; Vds is the drain voltage; and W and L are the channel width and length, respectively. \n\nThe threshold voltage of the device was estimated when the threshold voltage is at the value of the following equation: WL ×10nA. To check the reliability of the device parameters, the transfer curves of TFTs with different widths and lengths and the experimentally measured capacitance of SiO2 are shown in Supplementary Fig. 18.\n\nThe total amount of CO and CO2 was acquired by multiplying an area factor by the amount of CO and CO2 contained in the reference powder (CaC2O4). The area factor was deduced by comparing the integration area under the CO and CO2 peaks between the contaminated ITZO and reference powder (CaC2O4) from the thermal desorption spectrum.\n\n## Data Availability\n\nThe datasets analysed in this study are available from the corresponding authors upon reasonable request.\n\nReceived: 15 April 2021; Accepted: 13 October 2021; Published online: 22 November 2021\n\n## References\n\n1.
